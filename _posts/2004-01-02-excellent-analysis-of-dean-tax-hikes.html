<p>Steve Moore of <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/" target="_new">the Club for Growth </a>has an excellent analysis of Howard Dean's proposed tax increases. An excellent summary: </p>
<p><i>The Dean plan, our ad notes, would raise taxes by $2,472 a year on a typical middle-income family of four. Mr. Dean would also raise the death tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, the dividend tax rate and the payroll tax, and he would bring back the hated marriage tax penalty that President Bush abolished this year. There is hardly a tax levied at the federal level that Howard Dean would not raise. </i></p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107300503823525600,00.html?mod=opinion%5Fmain%5Fcommentaries" target="_new">Read the article</a>. If you think Dean might win, get your assets into off-shore accounts as soon as possible.</p>
