<p>Slate, quickly becoming the prickliest liberal thorn in Howard Dean's side, has an excellent commentary, today, by <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2093295/">Mickey Kaus</a> </p>
<p>I would add my own rebuttal to Dean's comments, but between Kaus's analysis and Dean's own political stupidity and pathological carelessness, I really can't make this any more damaging to the good doctor's faultering reputation.</p>
