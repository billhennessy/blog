<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107305563267857700,00.html?mod=home_whats_news_us" target="_new">Manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in 20 years (since the Reagan administration) in December.</a><br /><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107290591855878500,00.html?mod=home_whats_news_us" target="_new">Hiring will pick up in 2004 according to economists, with unemployment dropping .5% to 5.5% by November (as per my 2004 Predictions).</a><br /><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB10730472225886100,00.html?mod=home_whats_news_us" target="_new">Stock markets are up across the board, with Dow and NASDAQ safely above 10000 and 2000, respectively.</a></p>
<p>Stay tuned for more good news on the recovery. And to think it's all happening without nearly doubling our taxes, as Dr. Dean wants to do. </p></div>
