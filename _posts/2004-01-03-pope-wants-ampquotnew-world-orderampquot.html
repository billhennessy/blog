<p>His Holiness, John Paul II, has begun a crusade of his own.<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/pope/story/0,12272,1114946,00.html">According to The Guardian</a><span>, <span>&nbsp;</span>the</span> pontiff wants to replace the United Nations with an organization capable of preventing things like the liberation of Iraq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The pope made his speech flanked by none other than <span>Cardinal <span>Renato</span> Martino, a devout America-hater who felt sorry for Saddam Hussein</p>
