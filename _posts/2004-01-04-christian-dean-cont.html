<p dir="ltr">The Democrats have a real dilemma:&nbsp; Dean is seen by more and more people as both a shameless opportunist and a man who can't speak straight. Making mistakes of fact at a pace of three a week, he runs the risk of looking significantly less intellectually vigorous than President Bush--something most people thought unthinkable a few months ago.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that Kerry, Gephardt, and the rest of the Democrat field are scared of Dean?&nbsp; And should we all be?</p>
