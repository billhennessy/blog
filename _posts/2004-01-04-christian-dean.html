<p>From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52646-2004Jan3.html">Washington Post</a>:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><p>"I am still learning a lot about faith and the South and how important it is," said Dean, a Congregationalist. The Congregationalist Church is a Christian denomination that preaches a personal relationship with God without a strong hierarchal structure guiding it. Dean was reared an Episcopalian, but left the church 25 years ago in a dispute with a local Vermont church over efforts to build a bike path.</p>
