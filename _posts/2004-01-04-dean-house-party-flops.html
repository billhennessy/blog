<p>Ryan Lizza of The New Republic went to a Dean house party on December 30.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=express&amp;s=lizza123103">His report </a>is worth reading, and it jibes with my own research into the house parties.</p>
<p>On December 28, I decided to see which of my neighbors might be hosting a Dean house party.&nbsp; Like Lizza, I was curious and wanted to attend one as a non-Deaniac observer.&nbsp; While Lizza, who lives in the DC area, had about 30 parties to choose from, pickings were slim in St. Louis, Missouri.&nbsp; There were only 7 listed, and two of the seven had disabled their web links.</p>
<p>Of the five remaining, one had 3 guests registered, the other 4 had zero--except for host and family.&nbsp; Because of this, I decided not to go. In a crowd of 15 or so people, I could mingle, get some info, find out if these Deaniacs are as stupid as their candidate.&nbsp; But I'm afraid that going one on one with such a person in <em>his </em>home might get tricky.&nbsp; I could hear myself saying, </p>
