<p dir="ltr">As governor of Vermont, Howard Dean repeatedly ignored warnings that his state was unprepared for a potential nuclear problem involving the Yankee Nuclear Power Plant and that security at the plant was unacceptable. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20040103/D7VRILU00.html">Associated Press</a>, Dean, who criticizes the Bush Administration's war on terror nearly every day, underfunded critical programs to secure the nuclear plant even after September 11.</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr">"During Dean's final year in office in 2002, an audit concluded that despite a decade of repeated warnings of poor safety at Vermont Yankee, Dean's administration was poorly prepared for a nuclear disaster," the AP story said</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Dr. Dean's continuing hypocrisy illustrates both his unfitness for office and his supporters' intellectual laziness.&nbsp;&nbsp;That his followers consider Dean's lying, hypocrisy, and constant erroneous assertions indicates that these people are far more interested in the destruction of the United States than in electing a superior president.</p>
