<p>We know that Dean has a problem with his handling of security and safety failures at Vermont's only nuclear power plant.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/archives/005884.html#005884">Dean's World </a>has an excellent point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Combine the Yankee Power/Homeland Security issue with Dr. Dean's secret energy policy meetings, and you begin to see that money talks with the good doctor, as does he from both sides of his mouth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, have you noticed that the big magazines, Time and Newsweek, are starting to question the Dean phenomenon?&nbsp;&nbsp;While people like me enjoy ripping Dean for any reason, it's a bad sign when those who should support him begin ripping him.&nbsp; As I predicted, once he became too embarrassing for big name liberals to support, his star will fall.&nbsp; As the economy picks up, the Dems will look to give Bush a whipping boy for November--that would be Howard Dean.&nbsp; As Patton said about the German army, </p>
