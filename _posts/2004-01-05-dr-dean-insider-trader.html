<p><a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com">ProfessorBainbridge.com </a>reports that the doctor may have an insider trading scandal to deal with.&nbsp; Keeping score, Dean is now a hypocrite on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dean wants the Bush administration to release minutes of meetings with energy executives, but he refuses to release minutes of his meetings with energy executives.</li>
<li>Dean wants religion divorced from politics, but he wants to talk about what a bang-up Christian he is while campaigning in the South.</li>
<li>Dean wants Bush to spend more on homeland security, but he refused to spend what was necessary to make his state's nuclear power plant safe and secure.</li>
<li>Dean wants Bush to impose draconian rules&nbsp;to prevent stock and mutual fund&nbsp;abuses, but he traded stocks on insider information in 1991.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Before ridiculing the Bush administration, Dr. Dean should consult his own history.</p>
