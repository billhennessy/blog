<p>I found this on <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/afp/20040105/hl_afp/britain_health_sperm_040105105306">Drudge</a>.&nbsp; I offer a contrarian explanation, however.&nbsp; Perhaps the feminization of men--mandatorily sitting to urinate in pre-schools, supporting Howard Dean--is reducing the amount of testosterone men produce.&nbsp; I'd like to see a study that measures the sperm count in deficient men before and after a weekend movie marathon of The Godfather I and II, Patton, Braveheart, The Patriot (Mel Gibson's), and Band of Brothers (all 10 episodes).&nbsp; For kicks, throw in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Animal House, and My Cousin Vinny.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My prediction is that these men will produce an overabundance of sperm for the next three weeks.</p>
