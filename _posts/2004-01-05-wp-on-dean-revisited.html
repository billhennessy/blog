<p>Hey, I think I was too quick to judge the Dean on Religion article in the Washington Post.&nbsp; I felt that the reporter, Jim VandeHei, was soft on Dean and failed to analyze or even characterize the veracity of the doctor's statements on religion.&nbsp; Having re-read the article, I have a new perspective.&nbsp; (Hey, I've been celebrating the holidays, and the mind isn't quite up to full speed.)</p>
<p>VandeHei has done a hatchet job to Dean.&nbsp; The reporter didn't have to include Dean's misplacement of the Book of Job.&nbsp; Nor did he have to state, without color or comment, Dean's church change over a bike path.&nbsp; Nor did he have to put Dean's statements on religion in the context of Southern strategy.&nbsp; More examples of VendeHei's subtle inclusion of more information than Dean's handlers might have wished are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52646-2004Jan3.html">available in the article</a>.&nbsp; My favorite paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few minutes later, when discussing corporate greed, Dean promised if elected president to call business leaders from around the country into the White House to stress ethics and responsibility. "<em>Moral tone is a huge deal in the presidency</em>," he told the audience [emphasis mine].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading Dean's quote, &#8220;Moral tone is a huge deal,&#8220; elicits pity for the speaker.&nbsp; The sentence is utterly sophomoric, like Holden Caulfield's paper on the ancient Egyptians.&nbsp; Could anything embarrass Dean more than forcing him to read his own thoughts on moral tone aloud?&nbsp; &#8220;Moral tone is a huge deal!&#8220;&nbsp; Indeed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If my reassessment of the writer's motive is correct, then I owe Jim VandeHei an apology.&nbsp; This subtle, understated article may harm Dean more than all the vicious attacks combined.&nbsp; The article makes Dr. Dean look bad without the author saying so.&nbsp; </p>
