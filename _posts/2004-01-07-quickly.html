<p>Hillary Clinton came to St. Louis today to make <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Politics/ap20040106_1188.html">Gandhi jokes</a>.&nbsp; First, I&nbsp; live in St. Louis and didn't know she was coming.&nbsp; Second, she showed up in Iraq the day after the President, now she shows up in St. Louis the day after the President.&nbsp; Pattern?</p>
<p>Howard Dean potentially <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/national/national.bg?articleid=409&amp;format=text">faces criminal charges </a>for releasing secret security plans for the Yankee Nuclear Power plant after 9/11/01.&nbsp; He won't release records of meetings from his 11 years as governor, but he's pretty fast and loose with national security plans whose compromise could give terrorists the information they need to overcome that security.&nbsp; And people want him as Commander-in-Chief?</p>
<p>It was 6 degrees in St.Louis when I woke up this morning.&nbsp; Apparently, the answer to global warming is to have Hillary Clinton get out more.</p>
<p>Later . . .</p>
