<p>I must admit that I paid no attention the New Hampshire primary until about 15 minutes ago.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For those of you who are like me, Kerry won by more than 10 points over Dean.&nbsp; Edwards and Clark tied for third.&nbsp; (Is this Clark any relation to Ramsey Clark? And if not, why not?)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Howard Dean's post coital speech sounded a lot like a farewell, according to the snippets I read.&nbsp; He named a lot of people who work(ed) on his campaign, thanking them for their long hours, [insert all the stock phrases here].&nbsp; I haven't seen the poll numbers for the Primaries Formerly Known as Super Tuesday, but I bet Dean has, and I bet they suck for him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't have anything against Dean, except everything he stands for.&nbsp; Those who support him, and WHY they support him, make me puke.&nbsp; I can't wait to see how quickly they form some embarrassingly impotent splinter party after he bows out. </p>
<p>And let's start the death watch.&nbsp; Dean is intelligent enough to know that he doesn't do himself any favors by looking like Lieberman (or Gore in 2000).&nbsp; Like his buddy Saddam Hussein, who, in Dean's view, gave Iraqis a wonderful standard of living, Dean will surrender without a fight once he knows its over.&nbsp; His rabid, murder-frenzy, haven't-bathed-in-weeks supporter idiots won't get the blue-veiner throwdown at the DNC convention that they crave.&nbsp; He'll declare himself President of Vermont and ask Kerry or whomever for some surrender terms.&nbsp; If only he would make his withdrawal speech from a spider hole, the allusion would be perfect.</p>
<p>Ah, well.&nbsp; On to the Primaries Formerly Known as Super Tuesday</p>
