<p>These people are great.&nbsp; Funny thing is, I have good scotch and great conversations with people just like this every few weeks.&nbsp; Politics corrupts; Democrat politics corrupts democratically.</p>
<p>WE WILL WIN. KERRY WILL SUCK MY ---. EXCUSE ME. BUSH WILL LOSE. KERRY WILL LOSE.</p>
<p>Dean wins<br />Kerry dies<br />Bush burns in hell</p>
<p>GO DEAN!</p>

<p>I am a NOBODY BUT DEAN...I used to be an ABB, but no more.</p>
<p>I can not deal with the low-life, slimey politics as exhibited by Kerry. He is politics as usual.</p>
<p>We are politics as different!!</p>
<p>Go Howard....you're THE MAN!!!</p>
