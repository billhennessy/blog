<p>With that, the guards silently beckoned me to turn.&nbsp; The room was large and dark.&nbsp; Overhead lights illuminated the oracle on her seat and spilled onto the guards, but the rest of the room was invisible.&nbsp;Before me lay large double doors.&nbsp; I could see light fighting to enter around the great doors' edges.&nbsp; As I walked toward the light, the doors began to open slowly, admitting more light.&nbsp; I could see that pottery and artifacts stood on display pedestals all around the room, whose charcoal gray ceiling stood at least forty feet above me.&nbsp; The floor and wall were also charcoal, efficiently swallowing the light the doors no longer contained.&nbsp;&nbsp; My steps were almost silent, as the room's acoustics were impeccable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The walk from oracle's throne to the door was about sixty paces through the square, or cubic, room.&nbsp; My guards seemed neither threatening nor curious.&nbsp; Their faces--Caucasian-featured but negroid in color--seemed content and happy, though not gleeful.&nbsp; They were shorter than I and not particularly muscular.&nbsp; Perhaps they weren't guards at all.&nbsp; I don't know why I didn't talk to them, but I said not another word exiting the room into a wide, beautiful forest of tall, old trees, birds, squirrels, leaves both brown and green, shrubs, and, in the distance before me, the sound of a creek or stream.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I did not know where I was or why, but I was somewhere that I wanted to be.</p>
