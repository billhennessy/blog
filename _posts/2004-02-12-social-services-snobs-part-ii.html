<p>Why can they not even send a simple acknowledgement?&nbsp; Don't they realize that a woman with a college degree wants to take a pay cut to work a nasty job helping society's most vulnerable people, it's a compliment?&nbsp; I even sent Target gift cards to the center so some of the young women could buy small gifts for their kids, or something for themselves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The response from Almost Home's communication director was shockingly cold, impersonal, and sarcastic:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" color="navy" size="2"><span>I can assure you that all resumes that are sent into us are diligently looked over. </span></font><font face="Arial" color="navy" size="2"><span>We have received an enormous response from the employment ads that were placed and as such it has taken a considerable amount of time to go through.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="navy" size="2"><span>We are a very small office with an even smaller budget, <em>it is not financially responsible for us to reply to every applicant.&nbsp; The cost would be prohibitive.</em> </span></font><font face="Arial" color="navy" size="2"><span>As a businessman I am sure you can sympathize with this.&nbsp; [Emphasis mine.]</span></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2"><span><font color="#000000">I replied that I'm sorry I wasted her time, I didn't realize the high cost of sending a boiler-plate e-mail saying, &#8220;We got it.&#8221;</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2"><span><font color="#000000">Americans&nbsp;give more to charities in cash, time, and goods than all other countries combined [citation pending].&nbsp; We believe in helping our neighbor, and many of us would like to do so without the government's gun to our heads.&nbsp; But when an organization purportedly dedicated to helping young mothers is too uppity to&nbsp;acknowledge applications and too proud to say Thank You for a $50.00 donation, that charity should be shunned or its senior management fired.&nbsp;&nbsp;My guess is that those senior managers have a lot more to lose than those they assist. </font></span></font></p&amp;g<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=768" width="1" height="1">
