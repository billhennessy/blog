<p>I recently had an experience with a social services agency that paints an unfriedly face for the organization. </p>
<p>Almost<br />
Home, run by the Franciscan Sisters of St. Mary, provides teen mothers<br />
with the chance to make a better life for themselves and their<br />
children. In exchange for going to school, remaining free from drugs,<br />
establishing the norms of social achievement (job, daycare, financial<br />
assistance, child-rearing skills, etc.), the women and their babies<br />
have a safe, comfortable place to live, help with their children, etc.<br />
The women are in the home for up to one year and recieve follow-up help<br />
after they leave. It's a wonderful program.</p>
<p>The front office, though, is another matter.</p>
<p>A<br />
woman committed to helping others applied for a position at the center<br />
as a Social Worker. The center offered to hire someone lacking a degree<br />
or license in social work provided that person obtain the certification<br />
within two years. Aside from the certification, the candidate was<br />
qualified in all respects. Even if she weren't, it wouldn't matter.</p>
<p>She<br />
waited a week for an acknowledgement of her application, sent via<br />
e-mail to the business manager at the center's request. Worried that<br />
they didn't recieve the resume and letter, she sent a follow-up e-mail.<br />
Still no reply. She complained, understandably, to me.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="835140317"><font color="#0000ff" face="Garamond">You<br />
know what really bothers me about Almost Home? They are in the business<br />
of helping others and all I'm asking for is a few minutes of their<br />
time. I need their help. I need their assistance in helping me to find<br />
a position-be it with them or someone else. I need a little bit of<br />
guidance--and guess what? What I'm asking for is free, free. Just a few<br />
minutes of face time. I cannot believe that they haven't even bothered<br />
to e-mail me back. All she could've said is, Yes, I received your<br />
e-mail. Thanks for your application. </font></span></p>
<div><span class="835140317"><font color="#0000ff" face="Garamond">I<br />
feel so defeated. I can't even get in to a place, for an interview, and<br />
they weren't even asking for someone with a degree. How sad is that? </font></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span class="835140317">Her<br />
e-mail got my Irish up. I emailed the center's director to say I'm<br />
surprised that her organization is so lacking in professional manners.</p>
<p></span></p>
<p>Why can they not even send a simple acknowledgement?&nbsp; Don't they<br />
realize that a woman with a college degree wants to take a pay cut to<br />
work a nasty job helping society's most vulnerable people, it's a<br />
compliment?&nbsp; I even sent Target gift cards to the center so some of the<br />
young women could buy small gifts for their kids, or something for<br />
themselves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The response from Almost Home's communication director was shockingly cold, impersonal, and sarcastic:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;<font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span>I can assure you that all resumes that are sent into us are diligently looked over. </span></font><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span>We<br />
have received an enormous response from the employment ads that were<br />
placed and as such it has taken a considerable amount of time to go<br />
through.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span>We are a very small office with an even smaller budget, <em>it is not financially responsible for us to reply to every applicant.&nbsp; The cost would be prohibitive.</em> </span></font><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span>As a businessman I am sure you can sympathize with this.&nbsp; [Emphasis mine.]</span></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><span><font color="#000000">I replied that I'm sorry I wasted her time, I didn't realize the high cost of sending a boiler-plate e-mail saying, </p>
