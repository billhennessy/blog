<p>A foul and acrid odor greets the nose<br />and violates the shirt, the pant, the underwear<br />for hours, days, weeks, unwashed.<br />Plastic flip-top lid conceals<br />the quartered fruit, so dry<br />and old, unworthy of gin or tongue.<br />Tired, sad, bilirubin-stained faces<br />surround the parallelogram <br />giving more than they receive<br />and much less than they asked for.<br />Age marked in hollows, dents, and chips.<br />Laughters, hard and coarse, rise above<br />the jukebox boom of same old songs<br />that all have heard and hummed and heard.<br />The owner buys a drink for one who<br />surely needs so much more</p>
