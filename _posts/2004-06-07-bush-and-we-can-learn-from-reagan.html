<p>Reading reminders of the hatred for Ronald Reagan (now the most beloved former president in US history), offers a lesson for President Bush and the American people.</p>
<p>During his administration, Reagan repeatedly did what he felt was right or necessary at the expense of his personal and political popularity. He was truly hated in Europe and in American institutions of higher learning. Yet his confident and brave pursuit of good won both the political and the moral battles of the time and of history.</p>
<p>As we look at the war on terror, remember: history and providence will smile on those who do what is right when it isn't popular; only the devil will smile on the leader who follows polls.<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=756" width="1" height="1"></p>
