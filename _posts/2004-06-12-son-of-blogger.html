<p>What can you learn from a serial killer?&nbsp; It's up to you, but David Berkowitz's musings are worth reading.</p>
<p>I was in grade school when the Son of Sam murders captivated the country's imagination.&nbsp; It was an odd time in my life.&nbsp; Saturday Night Live was the most talked about television show.&nbsp; America, by and large, had decided to put Watergate and Vietnam onto the backburner.&nbsp; We were ready to laugh. But David Berkowitz and so many others stood in the wings, drawing us back to ugliness and death.&nbsp; Hard as we tried to break free from misery, suffering, and sickness, they kept pulling us back in.</p>
<p>Redemption is such a beautiful thing.&nbsp; In David Berkowitz's writing, we learn that redemption is available to the worst of us.&nbsp; </p>
