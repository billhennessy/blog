<p>A few days ago, I pondered the timeliness of Reagan's death.&nbsp; After Friday's internment in California, my pondering changed to certainty:&nbsp; America needed Reagan's funeral.</p>
<p>For one week, we took the full measure of a great man who lived in&nbsp;our lifetimes: a man who strode across history's plane with steps that challenged, but didn't surpass, the founders.&nbsp; We needed to cry, to laugh, to reflect on a life well-lived.&nbsp; And we did.</p>
<p>We needed to know that people would drop their business for days to stand in long, hot lines to view a wooden box draped in a flag.&nbsp; We needed to reaffirm our cultural norms and mores that Reagan so exemplified:&nbsp; standing when a lady enters a room, holding the door for others, holding funeral services for a child's goldfish with such aplomb that the child is moved to release its other goldfish from the surly bonds of earth.&nbsp; We needed to learn that deeply religious man can pray and perform acts of Christianity off camera.&nbsp; We needed to reflect on how great, good men did things.</p>
<p>With all due and some undue respect to our current president, reviewing Reagan's life reminds us all how small the men who've followed seem compared to Reagan.&nbsp; He was larger than life.&nbsp; I see images of President Bush standing with Laura at Reagan's casket and can't but wonder what's going through George's mind.&nbsp; <em>Ron, show me how you did it.&nbsp; Make me feel what you felt.&nbsp; Let me believe what you believed.&nbsp; Kneel down so I can climb onto your broad, powerful shoulders and see the horizon that you saw.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>Then I think:&nbsp; at least our president is humble enough to think such humbling thoughts.&nbsp; Would his opponent take the measure of man like Reagan and find himself wanting?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; Would Clinton?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But they need to more than Mr. Bush does.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And Americans need to.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyone who really reflected on Reagan and really measured himself against the man is better for it.&nbsp; The exercise produces an odd mixture of humility and confidence, loneliness and fulfillment.&nbsp; Most of all, it produces hope.&nbsp; The shining city on the hill is will glow forever.&nbsp; And we are the lights in its windows.</p>
