<p>And comes away disappointed.&nbsp; In his review of Fahrenheit 9/11, Christopher Hitchens explains his longtime craving for liberal version of <em>Firing Line</em> (William F. Buckley's long running discussion show on CBS and PBS), or even a liberal Rush Limbaugh.&nbsp; He hoped it would be Michael Moore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then he saw the movie:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right:0;">
<p><!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. <font style="background-color:rgb(255,255,0);"><em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em> is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity</font>, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of "dissenting" bravery. </p>
