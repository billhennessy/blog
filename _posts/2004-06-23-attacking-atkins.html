<p>Letigimate organization do a couple of things with their web sites:</p>
<ol>
<li>They list, by name and credential, the individuals who comprise their governing boards</li>
<li>They identify researchers by name and credential</li>
<li>They provide a means for readers to communicate with them, such as e-mail addresses or feedback forms</li>
</ol>
<p>The Partnership for Essential Nutrition provides the public none of these.&nbsp; It is an annonymous clearinghouse for opinions of liberals who want to dictate what we eat and how we eat it.&nbsp; Should any reasonable person reall be concerned that people like beef and bacon?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another thing PFEN fails to do is to back up its opinions with science.&nbsp; The group cites only three studies, all at least 3 years old, to back up its claim that low carbohydrated diets are unhealthy.&nbsp; What they fail to admit or even consider is that most scientific studies have concluded the opposite.&nbsp; PFEN is not looking for the truth; it is looking to take over your pantry.</p>
<p>Don't trust any organization that hides behind a web site, doesn't solicite your questions or comments, and refuses to provide for the slightest possiblity that it is wrong.&nbsp; Remember, the greatest scientists in the world believed that the smallest piece of matter in the universe was the atom.&nbsp; That was only 60 years ago.&nbsp; </p>
