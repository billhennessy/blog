<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/">According to CNN.com:  </a></p>
<p>The United States has formally resumed diplomatic ties with Libya after a 24-year break, the State Department says.  </p>
<p>Oh, if only the al-Zarqawi story were true.  Imagine, since taking office, George Bush's State Department has overthrown Saddam and freed 25 million Iraqi prisoners, overthrown the Taliban and freed 25 million Afghan slaves, disarmed and normalized relations with Libya, and, so far, prevented a single act of terrorism on United States soil or against significant US interests since 9/11/01.  </p>
<p>Since September 11, Bush has conducted the most successful foreign policy by a president since World War II, having liberated 2.5 countries.  </p>
<p>On to Iran!<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=737" width="1" height="1"></p>
