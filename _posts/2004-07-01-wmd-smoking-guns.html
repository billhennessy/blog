<p>Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld revealed that coalition soldiers from Poland have discoverd WMDs in Iraq.</p>
<p>Bet you won't hear it on television news, though. <a href="http://www.dod.mil/transcripts/2004/tr20040630-secdef0949.html">So read the source.</a></p>
<p>RUMSFELD:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right:0;">
<p><font face="Garamond">Now what&#8217;s actually happened?&nbsp; Right now you have the Iraqi Survey Group, which is a multinational group that&#8217;s out there reviewing documentation and looking at suspect WMD sites.&nbsp; I was with the Polish minister of defense this weekend in Istanbul, Turkey at the NATO Summit.&nbsp; And in the course of that, he pointed out that his troops in Iraq had recently come across &#8211; I&#8217;ve forgotten the number, but something like 16 or 17 &#8211; warheads that contained sarin and mustard gas.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><font face="Garamond"></font>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;Now these are weapons that we always knew Saddam Hussein had that he had not declared and they have tested them and I have not seen them and I have not tested them, but they believe that they are correct that these, in fact, were undeclared chemical weapons -- sarin and mustard gas -- quite lethal and that is a discovery that just occurred within the last period of days.&nbsp; If you think about -- most people remember the image of where Saddam Hussein was captured in that hole -- that pit that he was living in.&nbsp; That pit, that hole in the ground was probably big enough to hold chemical and biological weapons sufficient to kill tens of thousands of people.&nbsp; And therefore, it is not hard to hide things in a country the size of California.&nbsp; It&#8217;s quite easy to hide things.&nbsp; In fact, we finally found a bunch of jet aircraft that they&#8217;ve buried underground.&nbsp;</font></p>
