<p><a href="http://http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5305166/site/newsweek/">Newsweek, via MSNBC</a>, has a story about the &#8220;famine&#8221; in Sudan.&nbsp; What the f*ck?&nbsp; When Muslim extremists murder scores, burn villages, block food relief, burn crops, and lay waste to an entire country, it's not&nbsp; A GODDAMN FAMINE!&nbsp; It's murder, genocide, evil-incarnate.&nbsp; It's a spineless, greedy, UN chief taking money under the table to keep his mouth shut, as he did with Saddam.&nbsp; It's a horror and disgrace to a world that considers itself&nbsp; &#8220;civlized.&#8221;</p>
<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com">National Review </a>have been screaming about this for a year, and now Newsweek wants us to think bad weather's causing a lot of people to die.&nbsp; Sure, they mention the government and Muslim militia, but they keep using the word &#8220;famine.&#8221; </p>
<p>Words mean things, at least for a particular time and place.&nbsp; Forced starvation is not famine.&nbsp; Murder is not famine.&nbsp; Let's reserve the word &#8220;famine&#8221; for things man cannot control and let's ask the Old Europe wussies who were afraid to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan to act they've got a pair and send some divisions to Sudan.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And then let's withdraw from the UN.</p>
