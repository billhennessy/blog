<p>The stories, the facts, the meat of the case, against the United Nations are beginning to leak out.&nbsp; <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=106&amp;ncid=742&amp;e=4&amp;u=/nypost/20040702/cm_nypost/unstelltaletipoff">Here is one such story from the New York Post</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Saddam used bribes to UN Officials to divert $10 billion from food and medicine for the Iraqi people to building palaces and killing people he didn't like.&nbsp; The UN quietly endorsed this practice.</p>
<p>Giving money to UN relief agencies is more than a waste:&nbsp; it's supporting corruption that kills innocent people.&nbsp; The UN must be destroyed.</p>
