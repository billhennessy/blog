<p>Poor Dr. Sami Solanki.&nbsp; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3869753.stm">He and his colleagues at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich </a>have discovered that sun spot activity--which has been measured since 1610 and can be reliable tracked for a thousand years before that--has a powerful influence on the earth's temperatures. </p>
<p>Moreover, the sun, they've found, has been more active in the past 60 years--which coincides with "global warming"--than any time in the past 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Wait until the environmentalist whackos go after this poor bastard.&nbsp; Apparently no one told him that when good science contradicts liberal prejudice and emotions, science be damned.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He'll find out. </p>
