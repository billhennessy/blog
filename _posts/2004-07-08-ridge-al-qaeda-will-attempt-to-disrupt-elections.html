<p>Tom Ridge's announcment, today, that Al Qaeda intends to launch a major hit on the US to alter the outcome of our November elections should be a wake up call to all the people, like Michael Moore, who think that Bush is the moral inferior to UBL.</p>
<p>I hope we have more spine than Spain.  I hope the attack, should it materialize, will galvanize America's resolve to carry the Bush Doctraine to it's limits.  I hope young men and women run to the nearest Armed Forces recruiting offices to help in the war against evil incarnate.  </p>
<p>I hope, but I do not trust.  My fellow Americans seem, for the most, weak and selfish.  They lack anything approaching a long-range vision.  If wiping out terrorism over the next 10 years means a dip in the stock market, well, we'll just have to learn to live with terrorism.  </p>
<p>Prove me wrong, people.  Please. <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=704" width="1" height="1"></p>
