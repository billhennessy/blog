<p>At a rally after announcing his pick for Veep, Senator John Kerry listed the things that make the Democrat ticket a better choice than the current administration.&nbsp; His final, and presumably, most important point:</p>
<p>&#8220;And we have better hair.&nbsp; And that goes a long way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps if the Senator wishes us to take him seriously as a presidential candidate, he should put down the mirror, stop kissing his VP nominee, and attend the terror assessment briefings offered by the White House.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Until he starts taking seriously his responsibilities as potentially the next President of the United States, we should treat his candidacy and his party with the flippancy they have earned. </p>
