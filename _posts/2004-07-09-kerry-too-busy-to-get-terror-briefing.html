<p>Senator John Kerry turned down White House offers to receive briefings on the current terror risk assessment because he was too busy.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Last night on CNN's Larry King Live, Kerry had this exchange (from Drudge):</a></p>

<p>KERRY: Well, I haven't been briefed yet, Larry. They have offered to brief me. I just haven't had time.</p>
