<p>Yesterday (July 8), Tom Ridge called a press conference to inform the public that intelligence now exists strongly suggesting that Al Queda will launch a major terrorism act inside the United States in an attempt to &#8220;disrupt&#8221; (read, &#8220;help the Democrats win&#8221;) the November elections.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Almost immediately, evil bastards in the DNC and their minions in the press began a whipering campaign that Ridge was making up these reports in order draw attention away from John Kerry's campaign. </p>
<p>Only the criminal minds of ruthless people could fashion such underhanded motivations in others.&nbsp; These whisperers and the press who report their falsehoods are people who would, without a second thought, make up such lies for their own political benefit.&nbsp; There is good reason for men and women of good will to seek to destroy the Democrat party: the reason is the Democrat party. </p>
