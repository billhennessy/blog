<p>23 years ago, I met Joe DiMercurio at auditions for his People's Players production of Sound of Music.  Over the next four years, he became one of my closest friends, particularly on stage.  </p>
<p>Last night, after the thrill of a wonderful opering night, still buzzing from the excitement and the energy of the play, I found out that my haste in producing the program resulted in my omitting one of my best friend's biography.  It was punch in the gut that I delivered to myself.</p>
<p>I am sorry, Joe.  I will make it up today.  </p>
<p>Cordially,<br />Bill<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=684" width="1" height="1"></p>
