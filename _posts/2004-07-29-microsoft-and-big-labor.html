<p>A union is trying to organize Microsoft's programmers.&nbsp; The union is exploiting fear of off shoring to rally the workers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Having worked in software engineering for a decade, but observed the utility of unions over 40 years, I strongly urge Microsoft's employees to do some long, hard thinking before they sign up with the labor group.</p>
<p>Unions have been completely unable to stop off shoring in every industry they've tried.&nbsp; In fact, in steel, garments, and shoes, union activity accelerated the rates of job moves to overseas companies by making American workers more of a headache and more expensive. The primary motivator for a company to replace American workers with overseas workers is cost of labor.&nbsp; Unions drive up the cost of labor, making off shore workers even more attractive by comparison.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If American code bangers want to minimize the difference, they should concentrate on quality by pushing their companies to take advantage of things we've learned over the past decade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big, up-front design results in low quality code that no one wants delivered too late to do any good.</li>
<li>Trying to preserve old software written with code two generations old is more expensive than starting over.</li>
<li>No code should be written except to satisfy some test that's failing.</li>
<li>Test everything.</li>
<li>Build continuously.</li>
</ul>
<p>These simple principles, resisted more by programmers than by management, will allow American ingenuity and proximity to the customer to dominate the software industry for another decade, at least.</p>
