<p>Well, I was being facetious in my earlier post about Kerry suggesting we simply surrender to Al Qaeda.  But, once again, no matter how ridiculous a conservative tries to be, he can't top the way liberals really think.</p>
<p>John Kerry truly believes we should never had launched a war on terrorism.   He's not backing down on that stand.  </p>
<p>Good for him:  it's likely to be his last.  <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=663" width="1" height="1"></p>
