<p>Tom Ridge's announcement that the US has specific threats from al qaeda came a shock to many.  Yet it reminds that we are at war with people who want to destroy our way of life.  They do not believe in co-existence, anymore than Soviet leaders did.</p>
<p>Some, like the French and most liberals, want to pretend that these zealots wish only to be left alone. They are wrong.  It is us or them.  <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=661" width="1" height="1"></p>
