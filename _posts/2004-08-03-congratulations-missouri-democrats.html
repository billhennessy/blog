<p>You have selected the better candidate for governor.  Why does a Republican care?  Well, I'm also a Missourian.  I must remind myself:  What if the Democrat wins?  On the chance that the next Missouri governor is a Democrat, I have to side with the best Democrat available.  That may not be Claire McKaskill, but it sure as hell isn't Bob Holden.</p>
<p>Whoever wins the general election, Missouri's next governor will be better than its current one.  </p>
<p>Congratulations, Missouri.  Viva democratic-republics.</p>
