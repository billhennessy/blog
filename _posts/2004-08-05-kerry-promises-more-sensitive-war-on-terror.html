<p>What did I tell you people a week ago?&nbsp; I said that, reading between the lines, Kerry will not fight bin Laden, but schmooze him.&nbsp; Today, he admitted as much by saying he will &#8220;fight . . . a more sensitive war on terror.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Whatever funding the Bush Administration hasn't cut off from terrorists will now be redirected to the Kerry campaign.&nbsp; Either way, the terrorists lose their money.&nbsp; </p>
