<p>Once upon a time, the St. Louis Blues was my favorite sports team.&nbsp; Hockey is my favorite sport.&nbsp; But Larry Pleau has ruined this franchise.&nbsp; Larry is an arrogant, incompetent General Manager who has driven away more Hall of Fame hockey players than he has thumbs on his fumbling two hands.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Brett Hull wanted to finish his career in St. Louis.&nbsp; St. Louis hockey fans have been praying for three years tht Hullie would return.&nbsp; All seemed in order this year when Detroit, Hull's team the past three seasons, decided not to re-sign him.&nbsp; He was a free agent.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Hull doesn't want much money for a Hall of Famer--a little above minimum for a player of his tenure.&nbsp; Certainly less than the Blues recently paid Tyson Nash.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But the Blues wouldn't talk to Hull's agent, his brother, Bobby.&nbsp; Instead, Pleau decided the Blues best interest lay in re-signing Jamal Mayers and Petr Cejnek.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I attended only 4 games last season, so it's not like they're losing a lot of money.&nbsp; But I am no longer a fan of the Blues.&nbsp; It's so obvious that the Blues are not committed to winning.&nbsp; Bill Laurie, the teams owner, is just another Bill Bidwell.&nbsp; In 1983, I stood in the rain on the parking lot at 5700 Oakland Avenue to pray that my team would not move to Saskatoon.&nbsp; 21 years later, I really wouldn't care.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Maybe St. Louis wasn't meant to have a hockey team.</p>
