<p>I am simultaneously juggling four new websites, all built on the DotNetNuke portal framework with massive customization.&nbsp; The biggest challenge so far has been deciding</p>
<ul>
<li>What goes into the site?</li>
<li>What main tabs?</li>
<li>What sub tabs?</li>
<li>What security roles?</li>
<li>What can each security role see and do?</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, basic site design and flow. </p>
<p>In almost every site I've designed, I've begun down the wrong path.&nbsp; I don't get far, mind you, but I always start off the wrong way.&nbsp; I have worked with a lot of designers who have this problem, and a few who don't.&nbsp; Over the years, I've learned something from the latter:&nbsp; Don't do more than you have to.</p>
<p>You'd think that someone who preaches simplicity of design, simplicity of architecture, simplicity of code would understand simplicity of web design out of the box.&nbsp; But the array of options available to the site designer seems overwhelming sometimes. So here's how I approach site design now, in order to limit my choices on the first round:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create&nbsp;Main Menu items for each major user group.&nbsp; For a school application, those are Students, Parents, Teachers, and Alumni.</li>
<li>Create Main Menu items for each major general activity area.&nbsp; Using the school motif, those might be Sports, Clubs, Curriculum, and School Store.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Create a Utility area for subject matter administrators (as opposed to site administrators).&nbsp; This will hold master calendars, lunch menus, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.&nbsp; Now, let the customer flesh these areas out.&nbsp; Build the skeleton site using only the navigation bar.&nbsp; Start with the things a Student would want to see. Ask if Teachers or Parents or Alumni might also want access to the information?&nbsp; If the answer is yes, create a central admin tool under the Utilities area and shadow the controls in each area that needs them.&nbsp; Continue this process through each of the major User Groups, then each of the major Activity Groups, until the site is complete.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Remember, this is only a start and only one way of designing a functional web site.&nbsp; But its the method I've seen repeated successfully by site designers who seem always to get it right the first time.</p>
