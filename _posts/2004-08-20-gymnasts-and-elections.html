<p>The last time an American girl won the Olympic Gold Medal for All-Around in gymnastics, a Republican president won re-election in a landslide against a liberal Democrat from Massecheusetts.  </p>
<p>With the GOP convention around the corner, Kerry's bounce (or whatever he got from the DNC convention) is gone--Bush and Kerry are dead even.  Reagan was only slightly ahead of Mondale at this point in 1984, when Mary Lou became the first American to win the Olympic all-around.  </p>
