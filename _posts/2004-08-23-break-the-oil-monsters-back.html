<p>Oil output is up and demand is down.&nbsp; The reasonable price for oil is about $35.00/bbl. based on historic supply and demand balances.&nbsp; But reason has been thrown to the wind by a combination of pessimism, panic, stupidity, and hardy greed.&nbsp; The best way to punish the stupid and mean is to greatly reduce consumption.&nbsp; Here's some easy ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax-free days for telecommuting.&nbsp; Absolve employers of all payroll tax burdens on a day-for-day basis for employees who work from home.&nbsp; Anyone whose job entails using a computer or telephone can and should work from home--or a Starbuck's near their home--anyway.&nbsp; 
<li>Synchronize the goddam traffic lights.&nbsp; I live in west St. Louis County Missouri.&nbsp; At the speed limit, I should hit a red light no more than once every 10 miles on a given road.&nbsp; Instead, at that speed, every signal is red when I arrive.&nbsp; Some are so poorly synchronized and so close together that I often run the one stopping me to make it through the next one, 100 yard ahead, while it's still green.&nbsp; 
<li>Double sales tax betwee midnight and 6:00 AM.&nbsp; On everything.&nbsp; This will encourage stores to shut down for six hours a damn day and force people to plan a little bit.&nbsp; 
<li>Tell the fire departments to keep their trucks in the fire houses until there's a goddam fire somewhere.&nbsp; Don't tell me those things don't burn a lot of fuel so that the firemen can glad-hand customers at the local K-Mart.&nbsp; (And while we're at it, let's de-unionize the fire departments.&nbsp; $130,000 a year per fireman is a little extreme for the St. Louis area.)
<li>Turn off some lights.&nbsp; In my subdivision, almost every house has almost every light burning until midnight it seems.
<li>Everyone:&nbsp; Make a fucking list of all the errands you need to run and all the stuff you need to buy so that you can get it all in one trip.&nbsp; You don't have to return to home base after every little stop:&nbsp; dry cleaning--home; drug store--home; Quik Trip for a fountain soda--home; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond--home; Target--home; Best Buy--home; Blockbuster--home;groceries--home; liquor store--home.&nbsp; 
<li>While you're making that list, go a step further:&nbsp; Make all the stops on your right so you only have to make one left.&nbsp; (Think about it, then look at a map--you'll get it.)
<li>Cars burn more gasoline with the AC on than with the windows open.&nbsp; Try setting your personal threshold for turning on the AC a little higher.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea how much daily oil consumption would be reduced if this list were followed by everyone.&nbsp; But it would be significant--may 10%.&nbsp;More ideas are welcome</p>
