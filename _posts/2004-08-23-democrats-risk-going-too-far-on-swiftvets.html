<p>Just when I was ready to hand the election to Kerry thanks to the SwiftVets, the DNC makes me look stupid.&nbsp; I had no idea that they would do something as stupid as waste an entire Sunday trying to convince people that George W. Bush ghost-wrote the SwiftVets book, but that's just what they did.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Stupid, stupid Democrats.&nbsp; You were winning this one, you morons!&nbsp; Instead of being &#8220;presidential&#8221; and adult about it by having Kerry merely respond, &#8220;My record in the Navy is my record in the Navy,&#8221;&nbsp; you send out drooling attack dogs like Tad Divine to lie about Bush's personal involvement.</p>
<p>As a result, a man with visible war wounds has turned on Kerry with vengance.&nbsp; Bob Dole, whose one Purple Heart cost him an arm, is obviously sick of John F. Kerry.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/29319.htm">Read the NY Post article</a></p>
