<p>Everyone knows that John F. Kerry refuses to allow anyone to view any part of his official military records.  <a href="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/archives/2004/08/14/kerry_campaign_contributions_lack_disclosure.php#001341">The Truth Laid Bear</a> blog has found another Kerry cover-up:  his contributors list.</p>
<p>Even though federal election law requires that candidates for all public office publicize their contributor list and how much each contributor gives, Kerry considers himself above the law.  Bush, whose military records are public record, lists almost 100% of his contributors, while Kerry's disclosure rate is in the mere 70s.  </p>
<p>Why don't a few million of us e-mail Senator Kerry and ask him to comply with the law on contribution disclosure.  And how much do want to bet that, come December, the Kerry campaign will be giving millions back to Democrat billionaire who "accidentally" gave 3,000 times the legal limit (George Soros).  </p>
