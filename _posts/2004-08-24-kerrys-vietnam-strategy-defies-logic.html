<p>Rush Limbaugh started down this path on radio last week, but <a href="http://slate.com/Default.aspx?id=2105509&amp;">Christopher Hitches </a>beautifully finishes the job in Slate, brought to my attention by <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?cat=22">Poliblog</a>.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;logical person--a professor of philosophy, let's say, or math--mush cringe trying to defend Kerry's arguments that his service in Vietnam makes him more deserving of the office of the President of the United States than its current occupant.&nbsp; Here's why:</p>
<p>Kerry and most Democrats consider the US to be the bad guys in Vietnam, and the US military the perpetrators of wrong for the advance of evil.&nbsp; As a commissioned officer of that military, John received medals in commendation of his <em>unusual degree of service, aplomb, and achievement</em> in advancing those evil causes.&nbsp; Today, Senator Kerry defends and brags about what he did, in the advance of evil, to earn those medals.&nbsp; Therefore, in the minds of Democrates, Kerry having done more evil more diligently than Bush, Kerry is the man for President.</p>
<p>Such brainlessness is why I could never be a Democrat. </p>
