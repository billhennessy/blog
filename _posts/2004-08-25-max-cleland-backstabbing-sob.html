<p>Because Max Cleland was disabled in war, are we not allowed to criticize him?  Just because he lost two legs, an arm, and his sense of decency in Vietnam, are we not allowed to point out that he is a scum sucking, backstabbing son of a bitch?  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowry200408251621.asp">He takes a job from President Bush, then libels him in a disgusting display.  </a></p>
