<p>Letter to John Kerry</p>
<p>August 25, 2004</p>
<p>Senator John Kerry<br />304 Russell Senate Office Building<br />Washington, DC 20510</p>
<p>Dear Senator Kerry, </p>
<p>We are pleased to welcome your campaign representatives to Texas today. We honor all our veterans, all whom have worn the uniform and served our country. We also honor the military and National Guard troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan today. We are very proud of all of them and believe they deserve our full support.</p>
<p>That</p>
