<p>After years of preaching to the rest of us about protecting the environment, Dave Matthews dumps a couple hundred gallons of human waste on pleasure boaters in the Chicago River.  <br />Global warming is a theory, Dave, but dumping raw sewage into public water systems is proven to sicken people, fish, and water fowl.  <br />I'm glad you're concerned about things you can't control.  Now control your bowels, and we'll all be better off.<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=622" width="1" height="1" /></p>
