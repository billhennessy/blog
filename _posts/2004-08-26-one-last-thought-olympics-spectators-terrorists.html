<p>The IOC, Greece, and NATO spent three years putting up defenses to keep terrorists away from the Olympic games.  Now, the games are plagued with terrible attendance.  So I'm wondering if maybe the people who normally go to Olympics are terrorists who couldn't get into Greece for the 2004 games, therefore all the people disguised as empty seats.</p>
