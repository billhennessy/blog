<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/lacey200408250834.asp">Jim Lacey, in National Review Online</a>, makes some excellent points about the same thing I've wondered for some time:  where are all the terrorists?</p>
<p>After we invaded Afghanistan, we were told that tens of thousands of well-trained fanatics were scattered around the globe, increasing their danger and allowing them to recruit more members.  </p>
<p>Well, three years later, where are they?  Why haven't they struck?  </p>
<p>Mr. Lacey's article is well worth reading as explores some possible answers to these questions.<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=625" width="1" height="1"></p>
