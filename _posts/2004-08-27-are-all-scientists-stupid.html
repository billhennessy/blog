  content: Indeed. I am an Engineer and hold B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees and I've nearly
    completed a Ph.D as well. One of the things I have worked in for several years
    is modeling and simulation. Once you see how difficult it can be to mathematically
    model even a simple system and determine the stability criteria for the system,
    especially if it is non-linear, you will see that the so-called "scientists" simulation
    pf the Earth's climate are a joke. A very bad joke and the joke is on humanity.
    It is impossible with our understanding of mathematics and physics to model the
    entire world's climate system. It is nonlinear. It is chaotic. The Earth climate
    system has so many variables that there is absolutely no way to accurately model
    it. It is an absolute farce that they believe they can model it. Their models
    are missing so much data and so much physics that it should never be taken seriously.
    Further, they are using forcing functions and mathematical models to make the
    simulation converge to the result that THEY want to see and not what is reality.
    The inherent problem is the "god complex" that scientists and politicians have.
    Ironically, the less they believe in God, the more godly they make themselves.
    Well, I could continue here for an eternity, but you and I both know and obviously
    know these crack pots should never be taken seriously. Unfortunately they are
    by a dumbed-down public and self-righteous politicians with their control agendas.
    By the way, my major is in my M.Sc. and Ph.D. is Control Theory. Learning control
    systems theory has let me in on just how amazingly ignorant these people are.
    I certainly believe they know their ideas are bullshit, but they spread their
    lies to gain more funding for research and give the politicians ammunition to
    install a total control grid over humanity - full spectrum dominance if you will.
    The most dangerous people on the Earth are climate research scientists, geo-engineers,
    and the politicians that fund their alchemy. Take care my friend, and spread the
    word and the truth.

<p>A herd of&nbsp; &#8220;scientists&#8221; recently gathered in Sweden to announce a new geological era, Anthropocene, which is man's final destruction of the rest of the planet.&nbsp; These assembled idiots, embarrassments to whatever colleges granted them degrees, gave as an example of &#8220;catastophic&#8221; changes caused&nbsp; by man, sand churned up by SUVs and ATVs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, dust churned up in the Sahara. </p>
<p>
<p>Of course, these mice of science lack any actual numbers.&nbsp; Were they to study their own fields, they'd learn that the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 released approxomately 11 cubic miles of dust into the atmosphere, creating a mini-nuclear winter in New York, some 6,000 miles away.&nbsp; On that eruption:</p>
<p>
<blockquote style="margin-right:0;">
<h4><font color="#808080">It has been estimated that at least 21 cubic Km (appr. 11 cubic mile) was ejected from the eruption of Krakatoa and that at least 1 cubic mile of the finer material was blown to a height of about 17 miles (27 Km). The volcanic dust blown into the upper atmosphere was carried several times around the earth by air currents. This volcanic dust veil not only created the spectacular atmospheric effects described previously but acted also as a solar radiation filter, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the surface of the earth. In the year following the eruption, global temperatures were lowered by as much as 1.2 degree Centigrade on the average. Weather patterns continued to be chaotic for years and there were major climatological changes which affected the entire globe.</font></h4>
<p>
<h4><font color="#808080">Temperatures did not return to normal until five years later, in 1888.<a href="http://www.drgeorgepc.com/Vocano1883Krakatoa.html">***</a></font></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p dir="ltr">(It should be noted that environmentalist whackos use the year 1884 as the baseline for &#8220;proving&#8221; global warming.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the volcano made that year unusually cool around the world.)</p>
<p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, these scientists complain that the Amazon and Sahara could change climatological placs as a result of man's activities.&nbsp; Horse hockey.&nbsp; We learned in high school science class that the Sahara has once a fertile and temperate garden.&nbsp; The millenial rocking of the Earth's axis has shifted it, throughout most of man's existence, closer to the equator, scortching its forests into barren dessert.&nbsp; When the earth rocks back the other way (which began about 3,000 years ago), the Sahara will naturally become fertile, again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't remember whether the Amazon valley was once a dessert--but I remember a&nbsp; hell of a lot more science that the crackpots in Stockholm.</p>
<p>
<p dir="ltr">I have a recommendation for the scientists:&nbsp; re-read your freshman science books and stop using your phony degrees to advance your unscientific political agenda.</p>
<p>
<p dir="ltr">One scientist, physician, and environmentalist agrees, largely, with me.&nbsp; His name is Michael Crichton.&nbsp; You probably know of his work:&nbsp; ER, Jurassic Park, Prey.&nbsp; Last year he lambasted the &#8220;religion&#8220; of environmentalism which spews lies as emotional masturbation.&nbsp; Here's just a small piece of his speech:&nbsp; (Click anywhere to go to the complete speech.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.perc.org/publications/articles/Crichtonspeech.php">So I can tell you some facts. I know you haven't read any of what I am about to tell you in the newspaper, because newspapers literally don't report them. I can tell you that DDT is not a carcinogen and did not cause birds to die and should never have been banned. I can tell you that the people who banned it knew that it wasn't carcinogenic and banned it anyway. I can tell you that the DDT ban has caused the deaths of tens of millions of poor people, mostly children, whose deaths are directly attri<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=621" width="1" height="1"></p>
