<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton, long disdainful of things decent, appropriate, and cultured, will hold self-glorification rituals in NYC during the RNC Convention next week.</p>
<p>Guests&nbsp;(aka, donors) will praise Bill and Hillary while handing $10,000 checks to so-called 527 organizations--DNC organs invented by Russ Feingold as the &#8220;switch&#8221; part of the bait and switch of the recently enacted Campaign Finance Reform act.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sen. John McCain, the man who seems to make a living of getting hoodwinked by Democrats, now wants the 527 outlawed.&nbsp; Hey, Senator: wouldn't it be more efficient to just repeal the first amendment now and be done with it?&nbsp; </p>
