<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/document/document200408280010.asp">This letter</a>, published in <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com">NRO</a>, is from an officer who was onboard the swiftboat the night of December 2-3, 1968 when Kerry claims to have been wounded under fire.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/document/document200408280010.asphttp://www.nationalreview.com/document/document200408280010.asp">This letter is significant</a> because Kerry's defenders have claimed since the outset that none of the SwiftVets ever served onboard Kerry's boat.&nbsp; The author of this letter was the Officer in Charge of the swiftboat that night--Kerry's senior officer who would have had to have signed the award recommendation. </p>
<p>(For the record, I was personnel officer in the Navy.&nbsp; I served nine years active duty, mostly in the submarine force, from 1985 to 1994, and two years as an active duty reservist with an in-shore combat unit.&nbsp; I am very familiar with requirements and procedures for awards.)</p>
