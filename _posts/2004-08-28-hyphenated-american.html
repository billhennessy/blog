<p>I have never studied linguistics, and the fact that Noam Chomsky made it his career before he set out to destroy Western Civilization, pretty much guarantees that I never will study it. But I think I have a sense of language and its effect on people.&nbsp; I pay attention to the evolution of words' meanings.&nbsp; I like the way words affect the human mind and emotions.&nbsp; I like metaphor and simile and hyperbole--not to be clever, but to actually color a reader's mood the way tiny drop of dye colors an entire bucket of milk.</p>
<p>For a long time I've maintained that any word or term used to describe an undesirable condition will eventually become an offensive term to those with the condition.&nbsp; Word origin is far less important than word association.&nbsp; Thus, handicapped became disabled and has now become challenged.&nbsp; Problems become issues.&nbsp; Complaints become suggestions.&nbsp; Micks become Irish-Americans..&nbsp; Insane-asylumns become mental hospitals.&nbsp; Retardation becomes congnitive something-or-other.&nbsp; Elderly become senior citizens.&nbsp; Fifty-five year-old turn fifty-six years &#8220;young&#8221; on their next birthdays.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Recently, from a talk show host on a St. Louis station, I learned that American Indians, who wanted to be Native American for the past decade or so, want to be American Indians again for a very convoluted reason.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/national/29african.html?hp"> And, now,&nbsp;the New York&nbsp;Times informs us that </a>&nbsp;African-American is to general and must evolve into things more specific. </p>
<p>&#8220;Many argued that the term African-American should refer to the descendents of slaves brought to the United States centuries ago, not to newcomers who have not inherited the legacy of bondage, segregation and legal discrimination,&#8220; says the story.</p>
<p>While being black is not a negative or undesirable condition, being labeled as a member of a group some consider oppressed, others consider (even today) inferior, is undesirable.&nbsp; Eventually, any name for a category into which we herd individuals who really want to be simply Mike, Pete, or Tyrone, will become a term the herd detests.&nbsp; Life would be happier and easier if we cared less about what people termed a group to which we belong and more about our reputations as individuals.&nbsp; If Dr. Martin Luther King's dream was to declassify human beings from skin colors to character containers, he must not have cared too much about the category names.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Personally, you can call me a Mick or a mackeral-snapper or anything else that lumps me in with Irish or Catholic.&nbsp; It's good, efficient language.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just don't call me Irish-American.&nbsp; As Democrat Woodrow Wilson once noted, people want to be called hyphanted-Americans because they haven't come over completely.&nbsp; I am an American through and through. And I'm as Irish in attitude and temprament as my surname implies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>H-E-double N-E-S-S-Y spells Hennessy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Hennessy--that's me.</p>
