<p>Quitnet.com sent me my one month anniversary e-mail yesterday.  Last night, I went to my fave bar.  I wasn't even tempted to smoke.  Today, I didn't put a patch on (I'm down to 14 mg/day) until after 3:00.  No cravings, but I didn't want to take the chance in the evening.  </p>
<p>I finally cleaned the kitchen counter, too.  It looks terrific for a change.  <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=618" width="1" height="1"></p>
