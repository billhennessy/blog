<p>Obviously, the taking of hostages is despicable, but we who have shouldered the responsibility of keeping the world safe for democracy for a century must think "how does it feel?" when we <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,130458,00.html">read this news.</a></p>
<p>The combination of rampant politically correct anit-religiosity with paranoid fear of self-defense has resulting in two French journalists in the hands of hostages who demand that France repeal its ban on Muslim headcovers.</p>
<p>Terrorism is the use of violence against non-combatants to advance a political cause.  In this case, the Iraqi terrorists wish to influence French internal laws.  France has two choices:  capitulate or allow the terrorists to behead its citizens.  </p>
<p>I have no idea which way France will go, but Spain caved.  Don't be surprised if France does the same.  <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=613" width="1" height="1"></p>
