<p>I agree with Richard Brookhiser that second terms are, more or less, pathetic disappointments.&nbsp; After four of the most tumultuous years of my life (and I lived through Kennedy's assassination, Viet Nam, the horrid sixties, Nixon's wage and price controls, Ford's WIN buttons, Carter's malaise, and Clinton's intern training program, I think I'm ready for a dull four years of military victory, peace, and economic growth. </p>
<p>President Bush offers the best chance of those things coming true.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Second terms are usually bad because they're dull.&nbsp; The Presdient is a lame duck.&nbsp; His handlers are thinking about his legacy.&nbsp; Let's hope so.</p>
<p>First, Bush's legacy will be the war on terror.&nbsp; If major achievements are racked up, his legacy will shine.&nbsp; If not, his legacy will wane.&nbsp; He will strive victory in this war, not because of his legacy, but because of his character.&nbsp; Often, though, Presidents are hampered by those around them who wish their bosses would do as Clinton did and simply stockpile his good will.&nbsp; This time that's not enough.&nbsp; The entire Bush team will fight for victory over the enemy.</p>
<p>Second, Iraq must be settled.&nbsp; George Bush is the only candidate who aims to bring lasting peace and freedom to that country.&nbsp; If we fail in that effort, the war on terror will be fought in our streets.&nbsp; On this point, peace is only achievable through victory, and only Bush wants that.</p>
<p>Finally, a change in administrations has, almost every change since Eisenhower, resulted in an economic downturn.&nbsp; Eisenhower's first two years brough inflation, Kennedy's brought stagnation which he fought with tax cuts, Ford had rampant inflation, Carter had a recession, Reagan had a recession bordering on depression, Bush 41 had a recession, After one year of Clinton he told us to get used to 3% growth as a windfall, and Bush 43 had a recession.&nbsp; Changes in presidents cause uncertainty which is always bad news for the economy.&nbsp; Policies aside, the next two years will be better ecnomically if the White House's current occupant remains.</p>
<p>Therefore, as if anyone is surprised, I am endorsing George W. Bush for re-election.&nbsp; Bush is strong man of character.&nbsp; Regardless of your agreement with his policies, right now history demands a President who is first and foremost a leader, a pillar of strenght, a man of conviction.&nbsp; That person is George W. Bush.&nbsp; In the absence of Ronald Reagan, I can think of no other person I would rather see in the White House.</p>
