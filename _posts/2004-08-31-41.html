<p>I don't confuse George H. W. Bush with a great president.&nbsp; I do believe he has been and remains a truly great American, though.&nbsp; His performance as the former president father of the president has been superb--no one could ask for a better performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,130672,00.html">And his performance yesterday </a>in defense of the President and in opposition to the President's filthy detractors was stellar.</p>
