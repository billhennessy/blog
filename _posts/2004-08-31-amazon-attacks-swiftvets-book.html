<p><a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2004/08/amazon_annoyanc.html">Professor Bainbridge</a>&nbsp;has discovered another example of liberal hypocrisy.&nbsp;&nbsp; (They're so hard to find, aren't they?)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Amazon has suspended its rules of decorum for one book:&nbsp; Unfit for Command.&nbsp; The Amazon policy permits anyone to write anything about anyone--short of profanity.&nbsp; Presumably, one can offer cash money for the assassination of the Swift Boat Veterans with Amazon's ascent.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I was in a Border's two weeks ago where I found an aisle end cap dedicated to books on the election.&nbsp; There 14 titles highlighted:&nbsp; two pro-Kerry, one pro-Bush, and 12 anti-Bush or anti-Reagan.&nbsp; (They'll never get over Reagan.&nbsp; Therapy seems in order.)</p>
<p>It's too bad liberals don't have to live by their own rules on dissent.</p>
