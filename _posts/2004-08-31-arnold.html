<p>Looks like he's tearing it up.  So far, McCain, Guilliani, and Arnold have been the best 3 speeches I've ever seen back-to-back-to-back at a political convention.  I've been watching these things since 1972.  </p>
<p>Arnold, whom I laughed at when he announced his run for governor in California, is doing something no career politician could.  He is doing what Reagan did in 1976.  He is winning the convention.  </p>
<p>Following on Monday's performances, this is the most genuinely positive, upbeat GOP convention of my lifetime with the possible exception of 1984, when David Brinkley said of the conventioneers, "They're all so happy that can hardly stand it."<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=593" width="1" height="1"></p>
