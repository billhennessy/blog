<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5810443/">Howard Fineman used his blog </a>to spin for Kerry today.&nbsp; If I had any money, I'd offer a reward to the first person to find this quote pertaining to Al Gore.&nbsp; Speaking of Kerry, Fineman writes:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right:0;">
<p>&#8220;He is fundamentally a loner and a thoughtful decision-maker &#8212;sometimes too much so, which the Bush campaign translates as "uncertainty." &#8220;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Isn't that EXACTLY what they said was wrong with Gore? What we take for indecisivenes, they told us, was actually his deep thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">How many more planes would have flown into how many more building while (God forbid) a President Gore or a President Kerry pondered the decisions of how to respond to 9/11?&nbsp; I pray we never find out.</p>
