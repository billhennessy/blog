<p>Wow.  What an airhead.  I hope I don't offend any lawyer friends, but Edwards strikes me as the worst of his breed:  ambulance chasers.  I'll be he has more books on marketing legal services, maximizing profitability from a single client, and finding new avenues for class action suits than he has on actual law.  </p>
<p>John Edwards is a shallow, empty man who, absent our current legal system, would sell junk bonds door to door making millions without a scrupple.<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=599" width="1" height="1"></p>
