<p>I thought I was the only one who distrusts John McCain.&nbsp; (I have not trusted him since his attacks on Pat Buchanan in which McCain knowingly advanced phony charges that Buchanan was a Nazi sympathizer. McCain did so for his own purposes and permanently destroy&nbsp; my faith in his character.)</p>
<p>Apparently, though, there are quite a few people who have reservations about the one of the Keating Five who never seems to get a mention with that group.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Like <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1093919614.shtml">Karol at Dean's World</a>, I found McCain's speech last night surprising and uplifting.&nbsp; It cannot be portrayed as tepid, perfunctory, or utilitarian by the media. (Unless, of course, they're willing to flat out lie.)&nbsp; </p>
