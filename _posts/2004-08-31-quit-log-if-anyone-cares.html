<p>It's been 35 days nine hours since my last smoke, and I'm craving them badly today.  This is the first time I've wanted to smoke in over 2 weeks.  </p>
<p>I've saved $232.75, though, less about $95 for off-brand patches.  I have to buy one more box of 7 mg patches, then I'm done.  I'll have a net savings of about $130 by the time my patches run out.  Wahoo!<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=602" width="1" height="1"></p>
