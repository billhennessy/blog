<p><a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com">Andrew Sullivan </a>is sensing something that I'm sensing, too:  things are moving, at least at the moment, in the President's direction.  I think the protesters are helping Bush far more than they're hurting them, and Andrew has some other reasons:</p>

I don't believe his convention was wasted.&#8220;</p></p>
