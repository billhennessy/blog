<p>My server upgrade was easy on Thursday night.  The nightmare was getting my firewall reconfigured.  Yeech.  </p>
<p>I'll write more later.  Now, have to go check on my meatloaf.  </p>
<p>Great convention; best since 1984.  In fact, this whole election is starting to feel like 1984.  Let's hope.  Kerry is desperate.  Not sounding so.  Is.  </p>
