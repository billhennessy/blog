<p>Time and Newsweek polls released yesterday both show President Bush with an 11 point lead over challenger John Kerry.&nbsp; I know this because of <a href="http://www.drudgeport.com">www.drudgeport.com</a>.&nbsp; I would never have known it looking at the major media websites.</p>
<p>CNN:&nbsp; Buried on politics page</p>
<p>MSNBC:&nbsp; Buried on politics page</p>
<p>Why do I single out these two?&nbsp; Because CNN and Time own a joint website, as do MSNBC and Newsweek.&nbsp; Basically, CNN and NBC refuse to report the results of their own polls because, like spoiled, petulant children, the polls don't show what they want them to show.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The editors of these organizations are afraid that reporting Bush's lead with as much fervor as they announced Kerry's 2-point lead in July, Bush's lead will harden.&nbsp; They don't want this, though, as the men and women who run CNN and MSNBC are Democrats and liberals.&nbsp; They personally hate George Bush and despise the people who vote for him.&nbsp; And they are angry that there are so many of us. </p>
<p>The news of Bush's lead, though, won't be secret for long.&nbsp; The blogs will see to that.</p>
