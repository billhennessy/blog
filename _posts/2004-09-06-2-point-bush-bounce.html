<p>CNN, which downplayed polls by both Newsweek and Time, has announced THE OFFICIAL GEORGE W. BUSH CONVENTION BOUNCE . . . .</p>
<p><i>TWO PERCENT!!!!</i></p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, George Bush's convention earned him a smaller bounce than Kerry's.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, the 2 point bounce, according to the article on CNN.com, puts Bush at 52% to 45% for Kerry--a seven point lead for Bush.  I watch these polls, people, I can tell you that going into the convention, no on had Bush at 50%.  That's why the other two post-convention polls claimed a 12-13 point jump for Bush. </p>
<p>Perhaps CNN did have a poll that put the president up over Kerry 50-47, as they claim.  They sat on it.  Now, they're using the awful news (for them) that Bush really does have a lead between seven and eleven points, to make it sound like Bush got a crappy bounce from the convention.  </p>
<p>This will come back to haunt them.  What goes up, must come down, the Democrats reminded us this week. Responding to news of an 11-point lead and 13-point bounce for Bush, Dem insiders said, "Well, we expect that.  But bounces work both ways. He'll come back down."</p>
<p>If, however, there was a pre-convention trend toward the president (and there was), Bush's growing lead--or Kerry's collapse--is not going to change directions naturally.  Something will have to happen, and Kerry throwing hissy fits at midnight won't do it.</p>
<p>Again, the major media are manipulating the news to help Kerry and to hurt Bush.  If that's what you think the new media should do, you'll be fine with that.  Frankly, I think it's criminal.  <br /><img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=589" width="1" height="1"></p>
