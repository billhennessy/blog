<p>In 16 months of war, 1,000 brave Americans have given their lives so that filthy, vile creatures could travel to New York to spit, bleed, and deficate on Republicans.&nbsp; During that same period it is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and other organizations, that</p>
<ul>
<li>1,250 college-age men and women between 18 and 24 years of age died by suicide.</li>
<li>53,000 Americans were killed in highway accidents.</li>
<li>About 700 of 250,000 service men and women would have died during the same period without the war.&nbsp; (Soldiering is a dangerous business.)</li>
<li>Not one act of radical Islamic terrorism has been successfully conducted on American soil.</li>
<li>Not one building in America has been destroyed by terrorists</li>
</ul>
<p>Those 1,000 men and women who, we are told, are learning that Heaven's streets are guarded by United States Marines, are heroes.&nbsp; I have no doubt that they are met personally by Lincoln, Washington, the Roosevelts (Franklin and Theodore--not Eleanore), and, of course, Reagan who may well have been their commander-in-chief when they first took the oath. </p>
<p>One thousand families cry out to themselves in silent anguish, showing the world only the image of their hero's resolve and stoic determination to see the fight through.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One thousand lives cut short that others might live long.</p>
<p>One thousand reasons why Memorial Day should be about people, not furniture.</p>
<p>One thousand faces that will live, now, only in photographs and memories.</p>
<p>One thousand flags, neatly folded and ceremoniously delivered to the next of kin on behalf of a grateful nation.</p>
<p>One thousand more reasons to see this battle's final victory, just in case freedom, justice, and peace weren't enough. </p>
<p>Tonight, one thousand prayers of thanks.&nbsp; God bless them all. </p>
