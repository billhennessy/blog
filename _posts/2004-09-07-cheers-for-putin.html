<p>Western, though not necessarily American, reporters ask Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday why he hasn't invited Chechen rebels to the Kremlin for a meeting on their disputes with Russia in the wake of the massacre last week.&nbsp; Putin's answer was perfect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don't you have a meeting with bin Laden?&nbsp; Invite him to the White House?&nbsp; Can you imagine if people who shoot children in the head ever came to power anywhere in the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was such a classic example of liberal ignorance.&nbsp; We negotiated with al Sadr, and now we're fighting him again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When will stop relearning this lesson?&nbsp; How many innocents have to die before we stop negotiating with evil and start elminating it?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Update:&nbsp; I see <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1094554366.shtml">Dean's World </a>caught this, too.&nbsp; I did not realize that some fellow conservatives are upset with Putin's response. I think they are likely just against Putin in general.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; He's got the righ attitude.</p>
