    This was sent by my nephew with JPL in Pasadena. I don't think he would have sent it to me if he

    "I'm not going to even enter the discussion of whether this email about the slimeball is a fabrication or not.  The lesson learned here is that our soldiers deserve to be recognized for the sacrifice they are making.  If you see an American soldier in uniform at the airport, thank that soldier for what he is doing.  You can pass along your opinion of our war strategy to a Congressman, but you can't walk by a soldier without thanking him.

    He got off the plane and got into a bullet proof vehicle, got to the area to meet with the Major General (2 Star) who is the commander here at Bagram.

<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/moleman200409070834.asp">National Review Online </a>has this excellent, anonymous piece by a self-described disgruntled Democrat who attempts to explain why Zell Miller is so angry.&nbsp; It's great reading, because I remember my dad, a lifelong Democrat, becoming angry in 1972 and voting for Nixon.&nbsp; He went back (I think) the Democrats in 1976, but four years of Jimmy Carter has made him a permament Republican.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bottom line is this:&nbsp; Democrats will sell out their country to win an election. Their liberal base considers selling out America a moral necessity.</p>
