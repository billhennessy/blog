<p>If his irrational rants hadn't been bad enough, now Kerry wishes to bring deadly weapons to his debates with George Bush.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine the liberal outcry were a conservative to say this:</p>
<p>In West Virginia, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, gave Kerry a rifle as a gift. Kerry, a self-described gun-owner and hunter, quipped: <strong>"I thank you for the gift, but I can't take it to the debate with me." </strong></p>
