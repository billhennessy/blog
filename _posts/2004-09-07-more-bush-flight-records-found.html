<p>Turns out the President was a pretty good pilot, particularly in the classroom.&nbsp; This is from MSNBC:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right:0;">
<p>The records also indicate that Bush made good grades, scoring an 88 on total airmanship and earning perfect 100s for flying without navigational instruments, operating a T-38 System and studying applied aerodynamics. Other scores ranged from 89 in flight planning to 98 in aviation physiology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The new records are consistent with the President's long-standing assertion that he trained regularly until 1972 when transfered to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.&nbsp; If Michael Moore cared about accuracy, he'd have to swallow some crow.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">Then again, Michael Moore, I'm sure, would be more than happy to swallow crow, pheasant, albatross, or anything else that once flew.</p>
