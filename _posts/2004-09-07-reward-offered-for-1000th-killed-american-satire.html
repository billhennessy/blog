<p>With the American military death toll since the beginning of the war in Iraq at 999, expectant news agencies have launched the &#8220;Million for A Thousand&#8221; reward program.&nbsp; CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, AP,&nbsp;Reuters and the BBC are jointly sponsoring the program, which will pay $1,000,000 (US) to the Iraqi or foreign terrorist who kills the 1,000th American.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will be such a windfall for both news circulation [or viewership] and for the Kerry campaign that we all thought the person who delivers the story, so to speak, should share in the reward,&#8221; said a CNN spokesman on condition of anonymity.&nbsp; &#8220;We're hoping that the 1,000th death comes before Kerry slips any further in the polls, or it may not help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House said that plans are in place to take out the last of the insurgents before another American is killed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#8220;The only way to describe Americans who pay to have American soldiers killed is 'traitors,'&#8221; said Vice President Cheney campaigning in Ohio.&nbsp; </p>
