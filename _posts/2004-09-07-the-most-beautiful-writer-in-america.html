<p>Take that title to mean what you will, no one writes of politics more beautifully than does Peggy Noonan. She is is difficult to read, like some poets.&nbsp; Her writing makes me want to meet her.&nbsp; Her view of the world a beautiful one, even when she's describing horribly, ugly things she sees.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I feel guilty when I read her columns.&nbsp; Of all the stimulae she could focus on, she focuses on the best things all the time.&nbsp; Perhaps that's why she's not more famous, more loved, more treasured than she is:&nbsp; some writers make us think, &#8220;I wish I'd said that,&#8221; but Ms. Noonan makes us think, &#8220;I wish I'd felt that.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ms. Noonas has taken a 3 month break from column writing in order to help the Republican Party.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/">Her reasons for doing so</a>, though a month old, are worth reading.</p>
