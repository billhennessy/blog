<p><a href="http://www.cnsnews.com//ViewPolitics.asp?Page=Politicsarchive200409POL20040909d.html">CNSNew.com is reporting </a>that typography experts are fairly confident that documents exposed on CBS's 60 Minutes II were fake.&nbsp; The documents, allegedly authored in 1972, used proportional fonts and superscript lettering, not widely available in&nbsp; 1972.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am very familiar with the typewriter the Navy used in the 1980s:&nbsp; IBM Selectric III.&nbsp; It had changable font golfballs, one of which was proportional (CGTimes).&nbsp; But it looked awful.&nbsp; The proportional spacing was in consistent.&nbsp; Most people stuck with the Courier font.&nbsp;I believe that one of the fonts we had on the USS Woodrow Wilson had some special superscript characters.&nbsp; I don't remember if <sup>th</sup> was one of them&nbsp; </p>
<p>The IBM Selectric III was not available in 1972.&nbsp; And a National Guard unit wouldn't have had them until the active duty military was ready to disgard them.&nbsp; (Reserves and Guards tend to live with hand-me-downs from the&nbsp;actives.)&nbsp; The Selectric II was released in 1971, but I don't know when the DoD began purchasing them.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/lookup/encyclopedia/ib/IBM_Selectric_typewriter.html">Here's some history on the Select</a>ric.)</p>
<p>I would not be surprised at all if Dan Rather personally forged the documents.&nbsp; Ever since George 41 humiliated him on the evening news in 1988 he's been out to get the Bushes.&nbsp; </p>
