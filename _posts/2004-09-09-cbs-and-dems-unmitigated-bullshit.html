<p>250 private citizens -- Vietnam veterans&nbsp; all -- attacked John Kerry's previously unscrutinized service record.&nbsp; It made news because Kerry is running for president.</p>
<p>CBS News and the Democrat National Party, now, are re-examining Bush's National Guard service and spewing lies that were already answered and resolved in 2000.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I honestly do not remember a presidential campaign in which the media so forcefully and openly worked to elect one candidate over another.&nbsp; I think it's time to break up journalism in America.&nbsp; It no longer serves the purpose intended by the Founders.&nbsp; </p>
