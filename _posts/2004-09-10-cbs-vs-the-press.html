<p>I watched the CBS Evening News tonight, so I couldn't see the competition.  NBC and ABC were unable to find a single forensic document specialist who believe the documents on CBS News were legitimate.  These included former FBI document experts now teaching forensics at universities. </p>
<p>Apparently, the only expert who thinks Jerry Killian typed and signed the CBS papers is the CBS employee featured on their broadcast tonight.  </p>
<p>Funny--the liberal press isn't rallying to CBS's side.  MSNBC in particular seems to be leaning toward pronouncing the documents frauds.  </p>
<p>Me, too.<img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=577" width="1" height="1"></p>
