<p>Something on <a href="http://timeisafactor.blogspot.com/2004/09/media-bias-2nd-update-on-cbs-hoax.html">TimeIsAFactor</a>.com caught my attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;One of the 4 CBS memos about George W. Bush's National Guard service contains the following memo supposedly authored by his commanding officer:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';"> &#8220;Bush wasn't here during rating period and [sic] I don't have any feedback from 187th in Alabama. I will not rate.&#8220;</span></span></p>
<p>Having spent 9 years as a Personnel Officer in the Navy, the marks on Bush's fitness report for the period he was in Alabama are the only ones that could be entered.&nbsp; When an officer is away from his permanent duty station for a significant portion of the reporting period , the reporting senior must submitted a "not observed" report.&nbsp; Anything else would be conjecture. Not Observed reports cannot be rated.&nbsp; Lt. Col. Killian would&nbsp;certainly have&nbsp;known this, as any&nbsp;2nd Lt. would.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Additionally, reporting seniors may not use information from another reporting senior.&nbsp; Killian would have known this, so he would not have written "I don't have any feedback."&nbsp;&nbsp;It wouldn't have mattered if Killian had gotten feedback from Alabama--he couldn't have used it in Lieutenant Bush's fitness report for a period that Killian&nbsp;did not&nbsp;observe.</p>
<p>In this case, the Alabama unit would have submitted a "concurrent" report, meaning it covers a period also covered by a "regular" report.&nbsp; The Texas squadron would submit the "regular" report, marked "Not Observed" and directing interested parties to the Alabama unit's concurrent report.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dull, yes.&nbsp; But I supervised the FitRep process for many years, and it's pretty much the same across the services.</p>
<p>I will provide this caveat:&nbsp; I served in the active Navy from 1984 until 1994 and an active Navy Reserve unit until 1997.&nbsp; There are some differences between the Navy and the Air Force, and some rules may have changed between 1973 and 1984.&nbsp; I doubt that these did, though, because the FITREP Manual I used was release in about 1973 and contained only minor modifications during my 10 years in service.</p>
