<p>On the CBS Evening News tonight, Dan Rather lied about the reasons for questioning the authenticity of the National Guard documents he likely typed at home before cutting pasting a dead man's signature.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He claimed that doubters asserted that the CGTimes font "was not available" in the 1970s.&nbsp; No, Dan, no one's claiming that.&nbsp; Typography experts are claiming, though, that the proportional font was not available on common typewriters in 1972.&nbsp; Yes, the font was invented in 1931.&nbsp; There's an obvious difference.</p>
<p>He also clamed that doubters said that a typewriter is incapable of doing <sup>th</sup>is.&nbsp; No one claimed that.&nbsp; People do claim, though, that the IBM Selectric II, which was the most advanced typewriter in use at the DoD at the time, did not have a font ball that did <sup>th</sup>is. </p>
<p>Finally, CBS did not present a single contrary opinion to their own, fabricated party line.&nbsp; Pathetic.&nbsp; The AP found 3 experts out of 3 who claimed that two of the documents were likely forgeries, but CBS rehashes the same Kerry hack who originally &#8220;certified&#8221; these forgeries.&nbsp; What a joke.</p>
