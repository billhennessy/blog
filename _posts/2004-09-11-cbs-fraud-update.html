<p>I've been busy cleaning the house (Saturday is Field Day around the Hennessy house), but I have had time to look around and find:</p>
<ul>
<li>A retired Major General whom CBS News claimed corroborated the Killian memos says that CBS lied to him.&nbsp; According to ABC News, Maj. Gen Hodges, Killian's supervisor at the time the memos were supposedly written, says that CBS told him that all of the memos were &#8220;hand written,&#8220; not typed.&nbsp; The General says after seeing the documents, he now believes they are frauds.&nbsp; <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/NotedNow/Noted_Now.html">More . . .</a>
<li>The person whom the 1973 Killian memo claims was pressuring him to &#8220;sugarcoat&#8220; Bush's Fitness Report had been discharged a year before that memo was written.&nbsp; Obviously, that memo was a fraud. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationalpolitics/2002032742_bushguard11.html">More . . .</a>
<li>A CBS producer is rumored to have told friends that the memos &#8220;were too hot not to air,&#8220; admitting that any questions of authenticity were intentionally ignored.&nbsp; Dan Rather, apparently, was hellbent on airing these memos and didn't care if they were DNC plants.&nbsp;
<li>CBS admits that it does not now and never did have the original memos--only copies.
<li><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kerry/kerry200409111432.asp">From National Review Online</a>:&nbsp; <br />The only expert cited by CBS in this case, <strong>Marcel Matley</strong>, wrote in the September 27, 2002 issue of <a href="http://d2d.ali-aba.org/_files/thumbs/components/PLIT0209-MATLEY_thumb.pdf">the journal</a>, "The Practical Litigator":
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;In fact, modern copiers and computer printers are so good that they permit easy fabrication of quality forgeries. From a copy, the document examiner cannot authenticate the unseen original but may well be able to determine that the unseen original is false. <i>Further, a definite finding of authenticity for a signature is not possible from a photocopy</i>, while a definite finding of falsity is possible.&#8220;</strong></li>
</ul>
<li>Dan Rather has gone on a book-tour style marketing campaign, attempting to deflect attention from the legitimacy of the documents.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Dan Rather has used the term &#8220;preponderance of evidence&#8221; nine times in the past two days.&nbsp; By that standard, he and his handlers in the Kerry Campaign or DNC are guilty.&nbsp; </p>
