<p>Senator John Kerry, when asked about Admirla Boorda's suicide a few years back, commented that suicide is probably the appropriate response to disclosure that one knowingly wore military decorations not officially awarded.</p>
<p>I'm sure, then, that the Senator would agree that intentionally passing fraudulent documents as real in order to influence a presidential election is also grounds for suicide.  Therefore, I am herewith launching the Dan Rather Suicide Watch.  </p>
<p>Shortly, we'll introduce contests for Pick the Time and Date, Pick the Method, and Write Dan's Suicide Note which we'll have certified as authentic by CBS's own Marcel Matley.  </p>
<p>Fun and games for.  We're gonna miss you, Dan.  Have fun in the great beyond.  Say hello to Satan, FDR, and the Rosenbergs for me, will you?  <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=570" width="1" height="1"></p>
