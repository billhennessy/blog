<p><font><span>Having spent 9 years as a Personnel Officer in the Navy, I can tell you that the Sugar Coat memo is likely a fraud.&nbsp; In that memo, Killian supposedly writes to himself that hes going to give Bush no marks for the period, but Killian had no choice.&nbsp; Thats the way fitreps work.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>When an officer is away from his permanent duty station for a significant period portion of the reporting period, the reporting senior must submit a "not observed" report.&nbsp; Anything else would be conjecture.&nbsp; A Not Observed reports means that the Commanding Officer is limited in what he can write about.&nbsp; He cannot characterize the quality of the officers service during the period, but only state facts like the officers rank, his primary duty, his qualifications, and the reason for a not observed reportless than 90 days observed.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span></span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Additionally, reporting seniors may not use information from another reporting senior.&nbsp; Killian would have known this, so he would not have written "I don't have any feedback."&nbsp; It wouldn't have mattered if had gotten a daily report from Bushs CO in Alabama--he couldn't have used any of it a Fitness Report.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span></span></font></p>
<p><font><span>In this case, the Alabama unit would have submitted a "concurrent" report, meaning it covers a period also covered by a "regular" report.&nbsp;This concurrent report would contain the characterization of Bushs service during the period. The Texas squadron would submit the "regular" report, marked "Not Observed" and directing interested parties to the Alabama unit's concurrent report.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span></span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Dull, yes.&nbsp; But I supervised the FitRep process for many years, and it's pretty much the same across the services.</span></font></p>
