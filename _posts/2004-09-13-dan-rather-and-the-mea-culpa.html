<p>After reading William Safire's piece on CBS's fraud, I am convinced that CBS will have to retract and apologize before the week is out.&nbsp; When your friends tell you it's over, it's over.&nbsp; Dan Rather is, right now, Richard Nixon being told he doesn't have the votes in the Senate to acquit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What bothers me is how the MSM will treat Rather after he confesses.&nbsp; Instead of riding him out on a rail, he will be honored for his &#8220;remarkable courage.&#8221;&nbsp; A scapegoat, likely Safire's mentally unstable formre Guardsman, will be offered up.&nbsp; The Kerry campaign will be exhonorated.&nbsp; In fact, Kerry will make it all Bush's fault by saying, &#8220;You see, Mr. President, this is what happens when you start trying to besmear a man's military record.&#8221;&nbsp; The smug bastard.</p>
<p>In the end, no one will be hurt--except the former Guardsman with the mental problems.</p>
