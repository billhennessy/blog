<p>The Gallup organization shows the President has a commanding 13-point lead in its latest poll of likely voters conducted in the past week.&nbsp; A Pew Research Group poll conducted during roughly the same period finds the race a&nbsp; dead heat at 46% to 46%.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Gallup poll was conducted normally.&nbsp; The Pew people tried something new, by conducting the poll in two phases.&nbsp; Whether that accounts for the difference, I don't know, but somebody is wrong here.&nbsp; Way wrong.</p>
<p>I wonder if CBS had the Pew results certified? </p>
