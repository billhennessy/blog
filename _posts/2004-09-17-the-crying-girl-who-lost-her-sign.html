<p>Most of the world knows that a little girl in West Virginia had her Bush-Cheney sign ripped from her tiny hands by angry Democrats at a John Edwards rally on Wednesday.&nbsp; Sophia Parlock's dad, Phil, brought to the Democrat event and gave her a Bush-Cheney sign to hold up at the end of the rally, after Edwards had spoken. </p>
<p>Union thugs set upon the family, forcibly ripping the signs from the children's hands.&nbsp; Phil Parlock told the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040917-010155-8041r.htm">Washtington Times</a>, "She was crying; they were pushing and shoving her. She was scared." The picture of the crying girl appeared on the the <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">DrudgeReport </a>website, making Sophia famous.</p>
<p>While the behavior of the union thugs was criminal and reprehensible, I'm not a big fan of bringing kids into politics.&nbsp; I don't like spoiling a child's childhood with sex, drugs, or gratuitous violence, either.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>High school students, just a year or two from voting, should probably form an understanding of the way the world works.&nbsp; But 3-year-olds need to be worried about butterflies and Halloween costumes, not party politics.&nbsp; And no one should be surprised when Painters Union thugs rough up little girls.&nbsp; It's what unions do.</p>
