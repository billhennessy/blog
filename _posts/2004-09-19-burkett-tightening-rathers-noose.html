<p>Professional Bush-hater and admitted liar, Bill Burkett, has hastened the departures of Dan Rather and John Kerry from the national scene.</p>
<p>On Saturday, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132820,00.html">Burkett says he provided &#8220;information&#8221; on Bush's National Guard record to the Kerry campaign via former Sentator Max Cleland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; While Burkett did not specify what that information was, it is clear that it included the forged memos that, eventually, found their way to CBS and Dan Rather.</p>
<p>This information volunteered by Burkett closes several loops even for Kerry supporters.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Burkett, who has previously admitted to lying about George Bush out of personal hatred for the President, was the source of the memos</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Kerry Campaign obtained the memos before CBS News did.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Someone in the Kerry Campaign conspired with CBS News producers or Dan Rather to obtain a copy of the forgeries from Burkett.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Burkett forwarded the documents to CBS from a Kinko's in Texas to give the Kerry Campaign plausible deniability.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Burkett destroyed that deniability by admitting that he has been working for the Kerry Campaign.</p>
<p>Expect this story to completely unravel this week.&nbsp; CBS now stands alone in defense of its actions.&nbsp; When the 5 points above are accepted as fact, Kerry will withdraw and Dan Rather will resign.&nbsp; Look for the Hillary Clinton to be the Democrat candidate after federal judges order the states to accept a substitute for Kerry.</p>
