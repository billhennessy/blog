<p>In his biggest break from his previous convictions, Sen. John Kerry today announced that Saddam Husssain should not have been removed from power in Iraq.  If elected, the Mass. Senator will reinstate Saddam as president of the Middle East country, provided the Iraqis haven't already executed the former despot.</p>
<p>"Democracy has gone too far," Kerry told an audience of students in New York. "Some people, like most of the Middle East, do better under dictatorships and monarchies than under anything like a democratic-republic.  Those people just aren't ready for self-rule."</p>
<p>The Bush campaign chose to leave Kerry's comments alone.  "No comment," said a grinning Karl Rove when asked by reporters about the Democrat's new position. </p>
