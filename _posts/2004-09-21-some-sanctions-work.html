<p>I usually scoff at sanctions, like when the UN imposes sanctions against Iraq so that Kofi's son can make millions violating them, but I propose two sanctions against CBS News that will have a desirable effect on the Tiffany network's credibility:</p>
<p>1.  One year suspension of credentials to all federal government offices and events.<br />2.  Ban CBS from the presidential debates this fall.</p>
<p>These steps will ensure that the reorganized CBS News staff place objectivity and ethics before party politics and sensationalism. <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=557" width="1" height="1"></p>
