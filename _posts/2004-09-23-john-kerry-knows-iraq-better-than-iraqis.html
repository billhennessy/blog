<p>In the crassest act of political desparation since Richard Nixon waved the list of communist contributors in Helen Gehagen Douglas's face, John Kerry today told the heroic interim PM of Iraq that the PM doesn't know Iraq as well as Kerry does.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Well, consider the source.&nbsp; John Kerry believes that the world was a better place when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan.&nbsp; John Kerry believes that Iraq was a better place when Saddam was presiding over the murders of 300,000 people and the tortures of 5,000,000 and the enslavement of the nation.&nbsp; John Kerry believes that he knows how to spend your money better than you do.&nbsp; John Kerry believes that only he should own assault rifles.&nbsp; John Kerry believes that only the wealthiest of Americans should drive SUVs.&nbsp; John Kerry believes that he is too rich to pay taxes.&nbsp; John Kerry believes little green men wearing fezes untie his shoe laces when falls asleep on air planes.&nbsp; But most ridiculously, John Kerry believes he could handle the job of President of the United States.&nbsp; For a year, the media have been saying that the American people want to know what John Kerry believes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, they do.&nbsp; </p>
