<p><font face="Courier New">Thanks to </font><a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=4740"><font face="Courier New">Poliblogger </font></a><font face="Courier New">for </font><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/24/politics/campaign/24journey.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=28ac05f14b74e7ad&amp;ex=1253678400&amp;partner=rssuserland"><font face="Courier New">this link.</font></a></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">There is something chilling in reading this article top to bottom, perhaps more so because 1972 is the beginning of my political awakening. </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">My parents were naturally Democrats, and I grew up in the very Democrat, blue-collar neighborhood of Southwest St. Louis where Scullin Steel once cast a sulfur cloud shadow over the old frame houses built in the declining days of the Jazz Age.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">In 1972, though, my dad, who fought in World War II and Korea, did a stint as a St. Louis City cop, and was now a machinist, had taken his fill of civil rights, anti-war, and the kind of anti-Americanism John Kerry and that ilk represented.&nbsp; For the first time in his life, as far as I know, Jack Hennessy voted Republican. </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">And he&nbsp;voted for more than one.&nbsp; While McGovern had no chance of getting Dad's vote, other Democrats--Stewart Symington, and others--might have.&nbsp; But Dad felt, I believe, that liberals had cost him control over his own daughters who had dropped out of high school.&nbsp; Every night for the past fours had been fights, and bad ones.&nbsp; Usually between my parents and older sisters, but sometimes the battle lines shifted mysteriously.&nbsp; My dad and sisters against my mom.&nbsp; Mom and my sisters against my dad. Dad and one sister against Mom and another.&nbsp;My dad never talked about politics much, as he believed it improper conversation material.&nbsp; But he took political action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">On election night, 1972, one of my cousins came in wearing a McGovern button.&nbsp; My dad made her leave.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">It was the most uncharacteristic act I've ever witnessed.&nbsp; It just wasn't like my dad to kick someone out of his house, particularly a family member.&nbsp; But he would not have a McGovern button in his home.&nbsp; Perhaps the fights with my sisters in the previous months had been over such election flair; I don't remember.&nbsp; But my dad telling Sally to take it off or leave sticks with me to this day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">The young John Kerry of 1972 ran into a lot of men like my dad:&nbsp; hard working, quietly religious veterans.&nbsp; They were Democrat because they believed Roosevelt saved America from Big Business.&nbsp; While many belonged to unions, they held a healthy suspicion of anything big--business, union, government.&nbsp; To those who'd seen 3, 4, 5 years of war in the 40s only to get called back to active duty for Korea, hearing Vietnam vets denounce America was intolerable.&nbsp; They didn't enjoy speaking ill of a fellow veteran--except over a beer at the VFW hall after the monthly meeting.&nbsp; But they didn't care for the softness they saw in guys like Kerry.&nbsp; These punks were whiners who didn't deserve the honor of being called a veteran.&nbsp; No different than any other war, the WWII guys would say under their breath.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">You leave that stuff where you found it, I heard one of my dad's friends say.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">He was right, I've learned.&nbsp; There was a time when I thought it noble to expose heinous acts committed by Americans even under the stress of battle.&nbsp; I still think that's right; I also think it's wrong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">War is an ugly business.&nbsp; Though Sherman believed that we shoul</font></p>
