<p>In this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/politics/campaign/26vote.html?hp">front page NYTimes.com story</a>, the paper argues that Democrats are pummelling Republicans in registering new voters in swing states, specifically, Florida and Ohio.&nbsp; Looking at the headline, one might conclude that Kerry is gaining momentum.&nbsp; If you read more, then do a little independent work, you're likely to reach a different conclusion.</p>
<p>Okay, so the Democrats are better at getting people to register.&nbsp; No doubt.&nbsp; In St. Louis, Missouri, the Democrat machine is canvassing cemetaries all weekend.&nbsp; I'm sure the same thing's going on across the country.&nbsp;That's old news, unworthy of a NYTimes front page story.&nbsp; Kind of like, More Unions Support Democrats, or Republicans Polling Well With Self-Described Christian Right.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Inside the NYT story, we find an Electoral vote map.&nbsp; Bush has 257 electoral votes sown up according to the Times.&nbsp; Kerry has 180.&nbsp; The total needed for victory is 270, meaning Bush is only 13 away.&nbsp; The states still in play, according to the Times, are Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania,&nbsp; New Jersey, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Oregon.&nbsp; If the rest of their numbers hold, Bush would need only Florida, New Jersey,&nbsp;or Pennsyvlania by themselves.&nbsp; Or Oregon and New Mexico.&nbsp; Or Minnesota and any other state.&nbsp;Or several other combinations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To win, though, Kerry would have to win all but two of the smallest.&nbsp; He must have Florida AND Pennsylvania AND New Jersey AND Minnesota, Iowa, Oregon, and New Mexico.&nbsp;Were he to wrap up these 7, he could give Maine and New Hampshire to Bush and still win with 2 electoral votes to spare.&nbsp; </p>
<p>No matter how you slice it, that map is really bad news for Kerry.</p>
<p>What's worse is the new voter drive.&nbsp; The two groups of registered voters who are least likely to vote are the young (18-24 year olds are less than half as likely as 40 year olds to vote) and the newly registered, who frequently fail to show up on election day.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a political science professor, Donald Green, interviewed by&nbsp;the Times,&nbsp;new voters are very unpredictable.&nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you get 30 percent, or do you get 70 percent?" Professor Green said. "</p>
