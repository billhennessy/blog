<p>I think that most of our allies--meaning more than 50% of the populations of the several countrie--are Nancy boys.&nbsp; The Germans, the French, as individual human beings, are inferior to Americans in most ways.&nbsp; They are inferior athletes, inferior writers, inferior scientists, inferior fighters.&nbsp; Except for whining, crying, and cowaring behind Uncle Sam's red, white, and blue pants, I can't think of anything the people in these two countries, and most of Europe, do better than Americans.</p>
<p>All of this was inspired by a piece in <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/04_09_26_corner-archive.asp#040595">National Review Online</a>.&nbsp; Well, not inspired--I've felt this way for decades.&nbsp; But after reading the NRO piece I wanted there to be no doubt that I think most Europeans are cowards, led by dwarves, inspired by mediocrity, seeking nothingness.</p>
<p>Were this 1999 and the US military were sitting around looking for some ass to kick, these girlie-boy Europeans would be clamoring at the United Nations for immediate and decisive action to stop the humanitarian crisis in the Sudan.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our television sets would be filled each night with images of starvation, disease, and mass murder perpetrated by an evil regime.<span>&nbsp; </span>Democratsthe American answer to European cowardlinesswould be using the Special Orders hours each night to argue that Bush is racist for not sending troops.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>I can hear Charlie Rangel now:<span>&nbsp; </span>Were these pink-skinned, European children being eaten by flies . . .<span>&nbsp; </span> </p>
<p>But where is the outcry?<span>&nbsp; </span>Where is the United Nations?<span>&nbsp; </span>Where are the European intellectuals and the Congressional Black Caucus?<span>&nbsp; </span> </p>
<p>They are turning away and letting millions rot and die.<span>&nbsp; </span>Why?<span>&nbsp; </span>Because theythese cowards, liberals, intellectuals, smugly superior progressivesknow that if Sudan is a humanitarian crises that must be stopped, they will have to stop it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The US is otherwise engaged and cannot be disengaged and reassigned to this humanitarian problem.<span>&nbsp; </span> </p>
<p><span>Continued pressure by conservative organizations, including the Bush State Department, has force the UN to acknowledge that there is a problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>Europe still has not.<span>&nbsp; </span>Democrats in the US have not.<span>&nbsp; </span>Liberals, in general, have not.<span>&nbsp; </span>Years later, the killing goes on.<span>&nbsp; </span>As with Hitler and Fascism, Europeans wait for Americas army to fix the worlds problems.<span>&nbsp; </span>When that army isnt available, Europeans see no problems.</span></p>
