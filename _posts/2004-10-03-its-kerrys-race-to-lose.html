<p>Only the blindness of emotional loyalty would allow someone to watch the first of 3 presidential debates and conclude that President Bush demonstrated he was fit to run the country.&nbsp; As a partisan, I was embarrassed.&nbsp; It was as bad as Nixon's &#8220;well, I'm not a crook&#8221; press conference.&nbsp; Bush didn't look guilty of anything; he just didn't look particularly interested.&nbsp; Like his father in 1992, Bush 43 had better things to do.</p>
<p>By mailing in the first, most watched debate, the president has given the lead and the momentum to John Kerry.&nbsp; Kerry seemed way to smart a man to give it back.&nbsp; At this point, only the proven death or capture of Osama bin Laden will prevent John F. Kerry from taking the presidential oath of office next January.&nbsp; The Bushies must now develop a strategy to stay close in case bin Laden is capture or Kerry makes a monumental blunder. </p>
