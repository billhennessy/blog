<p>John Edwards is a lightweight.  He has called Cheney a liar twice, and Cheney has not responded.  He needs to address this directly, firmly, and finally.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted . . . it needed to be done the right way . . . now, remember, we went into Afghanistan  . . . we had Osama bin Laden cornered . . . and what did the administration decide to do?  They have the responsiblity of capturing or killing bin Laden to Afghan warlords.&#8221; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">Dick Cheney is really, really good.<span>  </span>He should be on more often.<span>  </span>He instills confidence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span></span></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">Domestic:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">Gay Marriage&#8212;Cheney. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">&#8220;Do you feel personally attacked when Vice President Cheney talks about having a trial lawyer on the ticket?&#8221;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">Wow, Cheney is prepped.<span>&nbsp; </span>Edwards, &#8220;So&#8217;s your old man&#8221; retorts are silly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">Cheney is a better debater.<span>&nbsp; </span>He zings Edwards at the END of his time which forces Edward to respond to Cheney without a chance to really think of a good comeback.<span>&nbsp; </span>Edwards, on the other hand, gets in his punches at the start of his turn which allows Cheney up to a full minute to prepare.<span>&nbsp; </span>Edwards also moves off of his zinger himself, lessening its impact. <span>&nbsp;</span>As a lawyer, he should know that you make your best points with the last witness of the day so the jury can think about it all night. </p>
