<p>I didn't see or hear the debate.&nbsp; Instead, I read bloggers' reactions this morning.&nbsp; Here's what I found:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.instapundit.com">Instapundit's </a>concensus reading is the Bush won by fighting to a draw. After the president's miserable performance in debate one, this makes some sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com">Andrew Sullivan </a>called it a draw.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deanesmay.com">Dean's World </a>reviewers took the president.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/corner.asp">The Corner</a>, though, is the interesting one.&nbsp; Based on the times of the posts, I'd say that Bush was miserable for first 40 minutes or so.&nbsp; Then something happened:&nbsp; either the president really picked it up, or The Corner's bloggers decided that they better talk up Bush or face four years of President Jean Francois Kerry.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to cast aspersions, but I suspect the latter.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Don't Trust Your Eyes</strong></p>
<p>In case you're wondering why I chose to rely on others' views of the debate instead of watching and judging myself, I'll explain.</p>
<p>First, I already know who I'm voting for, so it wouldn't matter to me if George Bush walked on stage with his pants around his ankle singing L'Internationale.&nbsp; I'd still vote a straight Republican ticket.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Second, I am always hypercritical of my guy or gal.&nbsp; I thought Reagan lost to Carter and Mondale, I thought Bush lost to Dukakis, I thought Bush lost to Clinton (and I was right), I thought Dole lost to Clinton (and I was right again).&nbsp; I did think Bush topped Gore in all debates in 2000, but Gore is insane--anyone would have beaten him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, had I watched the debate, I'd have sat cringing at Bush's every word and been depressed for hours.</p>
<p>Third, in determining the effect of the debate on the election, my opinion of Bush's performance vis a vis Kerry is meaningless.&nbsp; The winner, as Scrappleface pointed out, is not determined by the people who watch the debate, but by what the talking heads tell the undecideds to think.&nbsp; Therefore, how the pundits scored the fight is what the masses will believe.</p>
<p>On this measure, Bush won--big time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Kerry's &#8220;Read My Lips&#8221; moment will dog him for the next 3 days.&nbsp; Bush's &#8220;Need Wood&#8221; could be a campaign button for the uber-male theme the Bush campaign already commands.&nbsp; Bush's humor worked, Kerry's flopped.&nbsp; Bush's body language was presidential, while Kerry's was prosecutorial.&nbsp; Bush wanted to hug the audience, while Kerry wanted to help them.&nbsp; Apparently, at one point, Kerry said that no one in the room looked like they made $200,000 a year.&nbsp; What self-important buffoon.&nbsp; He might as well have said, &#8220;I'm glad you people had the opportunity to see the inside of Washington University--since none of you could get admitted to such a fine establishement of higher learning.&#8221;</p>
