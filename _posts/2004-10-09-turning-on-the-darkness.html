<p>I turned my back to the darker world many years ago. </p>
<p>I trained my focus on lighter things and happier sounds.</p>
<p>I let myself laugh at things that I wouldnt have before.</p>
<p>I let myself cry when babies laughed or someone, with</p>
<p>Just the right inflection and sincerity, said, God Bless</p>
<p>America or Look at that rainbowthere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the darkness didnt turn its back on me, for sure.</p>
<p>Hes kept me in his gaze like a lions on a gazelle.</p>
<p>However faster I laughed or cried, he slithered </p>
<p>All the faster.<span>&nbsp; </span>Patience.<span>&nbsp; </span>Waiting outs his game.</p>
<p>Look how easily you laugh, Amy said at Uncle Bills.</p>
<p>And still, behind me, sat the darker world eating pancakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The darker world has overtaken my decelerating stride.</p>
<p>Hes before me now, and, though I turn, he scampers</p>
<p>Back to face me head-on.<span>&nbsp; </span>I turn in circles, avoiding him.</p>
<p>A duller mind would think that darkness lay all around.</p>
<p>I dont.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know its only a shadow.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, God, how I wish</p>
<p>Hed slow down, too, and turn his back on me.</p>
