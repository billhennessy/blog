<p>If Kerry has his way, the price of an abortion will increase dramatically, because Kerry wants the government to pay for them.</p>
<p>For years I've maintained that the ridiculous cost of a college class is the fault of the government's insane college assistance program.&nbsp; Providing funding for the difference between what a student can afford and what a college charges is a salesman's dream come true.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Imagine if the government did the same for homes.&nbsp; Say I make $75,000 a year and I can borrow up to $250,000 for a house.&nbsp; I want to buy your house, because, by today's standards, it's a $250,000 home.&nbsp; But you know the government will pile on any amount I need to make up the difference.&nbsp; You'd be a fool to charge me $250,000.&nbsp; Charge $500,000.&nbsp; $1,000,000.&nbsp; Whatever I'm willing to borrow.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Under such forulae, prices for goods and services reflect the willingness of buyers to borrow, not the perceived value of the good or service itself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice that the two areas of life in which some outside entity appears to be paying the differenc between the asking price and the offer price--healthcare and eduction--are the two segments of the economy that grow 2-5 times faster than the general inflation every year.&nbsp; It's not a coincidence. </p>
<p>The cost of college tuition has increased at twice the rate of inflation for most of my life, according to the federal government.</p>
