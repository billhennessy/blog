<p>In today's <a href="http://opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=110005741">OpinionJournal.com </a>(Wall Street Journal), John Fund details recent AFL-CIO criminal activity aimed at intimidating Republicans in Missouri, Florida, and Michigan.&nbsp; I brought some of these stories to Dean's World's attention last week while this site was down.</p>
<p>What could be more demonstrative of the Democrat intellectualism than these stories.&nbsp; They send sub-human union neanderthals to smash up Republican campaign offices because they're afraid of losing on merit.&nbsp; Then again, isn't the purpose of unionism to eliminate merit-based rewards?</p>
<p>The next time some lefty accuses Republicans of might-makes-right thinking, use these stories to point out the real proponents of the practice.&nbsp;And remember the wisdom of General Patton should you feel threatened at a polling place or campaign office:&nbsp; �The only thing to do when some son of a bitch looks at you sideways is to beat the hell out of him right then and there.�&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guy who throws the first punch usually wins.</p>
