<p>It took me just a second</p>
<p>to stop and watch them play.</p>
<p>My coffee cup felt grown up</p>
<p>when the ball bounced toward my feet.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to smile at them.</p>
<p>My eyes did, though. And big</p>
<p>Then I carried on inside.</p>
<p>They won't be there when I go out.</p>
<p>They're like my coffee cup.</p>
