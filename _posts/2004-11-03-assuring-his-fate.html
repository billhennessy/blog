<p>John Kerry has apparently decided to contest the presidential election in the courts by forcing Ohio,&nbsp;to count&nbsp;its 150,000 provisional ballots.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should that fail,&nbsp;perhaps he'll sue everyone who voted for Bush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If John Kerry forces a prolonged fight in Ohio,&nbsp;he will have assured himself an ignoble, despised place in American history.</p>
<p>In 2000, Al Gore had several factors on his side&nbsp;that somewhat supported his challenges:</p>
<p>--Gore won the popular vote<br />--The contested state, Florida, had a difference of just 5,000 votes<br />--The country was at peace<br />--Voters in Florida had problems all night long</p>
<p>In 2004, Kerry risks an accusation of treason by suing to become president<br />--Bush won the popular vote by&nbsp;nearly 4&nbsp;million votes<br />--The contested state, Ohio, has a difference of more than 130,000 votes in Bush's favor, meaning almost 100% of the provisional ballots would have to be for Kerry in order to change the outcome<br />--The country is at war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, Southeast Asia with hundreds of thousands of American lives on the line every day<br />--Except for long lines, Ohio had virtually no problems, and Democrats were permitted to vote until midnight</p>
<p>But reason is never good enough for these modern Democrats. Kerry and Edwards will sue and spin until Democrats, once again, convince themselves--and only themselves--that the President's victory is illigetimate. The process will be&nbsp;gut-wrenching, especially for those watching from Iraq, Afghanistan, and the other front lines of the terror wars.</p>
<p>If you are a patriotic Democrat, call Kerry and ask him to go respectfully away. It's the American thing to do.  <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=525" width="1" height="1"></p>
