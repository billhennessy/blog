<p>I'm not buying the story that yesterday's leaked, mid-day exit poll results were innocently in err.&nbsp; No way.&nbsp;They were intentionally skewed toward Kerry to discourage Bush votes in the afternoon and evening. </p>
<p>This was shameful.&nbsp; Again and again in this election, the MSM have used their power to influence the vote.&nbsp; Again and again, they were thwarted by the will of the people.&nbsp; Now, let's have the will of the people dismantle the MSM.</p>
