<p>Just took a quick trip through DemocraticUnderground.&nbsp; Hehehehehe.&nbsp; Oh, there's such joy in Mudville. </p>
<p>My favorite posts, summarized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone who voted for Bush is a toothless, SUV-driving, NASCAR-watching, illiterate who doesn't deserve to vote</li>
<li>America will become a 3rd world country</li>
<li>Calling for boycotts of all American products by both Americans and everyone else in the world</li>
<li>Begging Canada to annex the blue states.&nbsp; (I'm not sure I'd stand in the way)</li>
<li>Virtually hugs to liberals in red states who have to live amongst brain-dead idiots</li>
<li>Hopes that radical Islamists will kill all American soldiers in the Middle East</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks, these are the sentiments of the people we just defeated.&nbsp; Thank God. </p>
