<p>The networks and newspapers are not calling states they know Bush has won in order to not force Kerry to concede.&nbsp; <a href="http://jaycost.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-is-disgusting.html">As Jay Cost points out</a>, this is disgraceful. </p>
<p>I will call it.&nbsp; Bush has now won Nevada, New Mexico, Iowa, and Ohio.&nbsp; He has won the popular vote.&nbsp; George W. Bush has been re-elected to a second term as President of the United States by the will of its free citizens.</p>
<p>May God have mercy on the Democrat party. </p>
