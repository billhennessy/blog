<p>Liberals (and you should check out CaptainNormal.com, democraticunderground.com, or Jane Smiley's vituperations in Slate.com) want us to believe that a few ignorant, hate-filled yahoos in a handful of places like Macon, Georgia and Waco, Texas gave this election to President Bush.&nbsp; They think they, not the 58 million who voted for Bush, are the majority.&nbsp; </p>
<p>USA Today has given us a county-by-county map of the election.&nbsp; If I were a Blue American, I'd be worried.</p>
