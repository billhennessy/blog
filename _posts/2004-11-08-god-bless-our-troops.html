<p>The assault on Fallujah has begun.&nbsp; 10,000 of the bravest Americans and Iraqis are about test their mettle.&nbsp; God bless them all.&nbsp; May each return to his family with all of his faculties.</p>
<p>How dare we forget the struggles of the few for the many.&nbsp; May those who must fall in fighting find fast, safe passage to eternal salvation, and may they one day welcome us, the&nbsp;beneficiaries of the their sacrifice, into God's waiting arms.</p>
