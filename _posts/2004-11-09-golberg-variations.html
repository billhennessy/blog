<p>This <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg.asp">Jonah Goldberg piece in The Corner </a>is a classic--one to print on acid-free paper and keep in a safe place.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nod to <a href="http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001282.php">INDC Journal</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Goldberg makes a point that I've been trying to make since Phil Collins was just Genesis's drummer:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right:0;">
<p><font face="Georgia">What Maher, Raines, and Smiley fail to grasp is that all morality is based upon transcendence &#8212; or it is merely based on utilitarianism of one kind or another, and therefore it is not morality so much as, at best, an enlightened expediency or will-to-power. It is no more rational to vote based on a desire to do "good" than it is to vote based on a desire to do God's will. Indeed, for millions of people this is a distinction without a difference &#8212; as it was for so many of the abolitionists progressives and civil-rights leaders today's liberals love to invoke but never actually learn about. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Precisely.&nbsp; To be morality, it must commence from outside man, otherwise is mere sentiment, as <a href="http://www.chesterton.org/gkc/theologian/whychristian.htm">Chesterton might say</a>.</p>
