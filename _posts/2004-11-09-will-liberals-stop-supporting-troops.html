<p><a href="http://www.arguewithsigns.net/archives/2004/11/07/couldnt_let_this_pass/">Arguing with Sign Posts </a>reminds me that liberals continue to say things that seem, well, silly. But some liberals are teetering frightening close to the truth. </p>
<p>Someone posting to the democraticunderground.org forum ponders whether it's time for liberals to stop supporting our troops.&nbsp; Her reasoning goes thusly:&nbsp; George Bush is&nbsp;a known evil; those who support Bush support evil; 72% of American service members in Iraq supported George Bush; therefore; 72% of American service member in Iraq are evil.</p>
<p>While conservatives are tempted to give such arguments a James Brown hagh,&nbsp; the truth is, she's right.&nbsp; Sort of. </p>
<p>Reagan restored America's pride in and veneration of the military.&nbsp; Beginning in about 1983, it became popular to be For Our Troops but Against This [war, occupation, intervention, sabre-rattling, build-up, whatever].&nbsp; Of course, it was always liberals making this claim, though they maintain a healthy distrust of military and the people who wore the uniform.</p>
<p>I have maintained for more than a decade--even while I was still wearing a Navy uniform--that supporting the troops while decrying their mission is logically impossible the way the liberals attempted to do it.&nbsp; By that I mean, they wanted American forces to lose to the enemy, but they claimed to support our troops.&nbsp; In other words, they respected the people in uniform while they are alive, but they hope our enemies will soon kill them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'm not sure that a large portion of liberal America will decide to public pull for Al Qaeda.&nbsp; But I do think we'll see&nbsp;liberals demonstrate more hostility toward people in uniform.&nbsp; That's good for all of us, because, in time of war, it's good to know who your real enemies are.</p>
