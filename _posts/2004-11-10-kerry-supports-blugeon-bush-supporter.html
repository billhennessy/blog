<p>According to posters to liberal forums, conservatives have a monopoly on violence.&nbsp; But some young Democrats, it seems, have learned their lessons from the union thugs who destroyed numerous Bush-Cheney and Republican offices prior to the election.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Three high school seniors who supported Kerry beat a Bush supporter with baseball bat and chains after school yesterday.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">The SAINT PAUL PIONEER PRESS reported in morning editions: The argument began earlier in the day Thursday with a discussion about candidates the minors had supported for president, Backstrom said. The two victims supported President Bush.</font></strong></p>
