<p>At the 1983 Lincoln Days in the Chase-Park Plaza in St. Louis,&nbsp;I followed a group of partiers from Jack Danforth's room up a few flights of dingy stairs to Ashcroft's room.&nbsp; At the time, John Ashcroft was Missouri's Attorney-General who was seeking to replace Kit Bond as Governor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As we slithered between preppily dressed bodies in the once glamorous hotel, a shout came from up ahead, repeated in various voices of shock and amazement.&nbsp; &#8220;No booze.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashcroft was a tea-tottler.&nbsp; Gads.</p>
<p>I turned, scotch and soda in hand, and returned to the Danforth party, where the open bar seemed, oh, so inviting.&nbsp; My cadre followed.</p>
<p>In historical perspective, John Ashcroft's improbably ascent to Attorney-General of the United States will be good material for a book.&nbsp; Back in 1983, the Religious Right was sneered as much in Republican circles as it is today in liberal ones.&nbsp; In St. Louis, Missouri, home of Anheuser-Busch, a politician who doesn't serve beer at Lincoln Days usually doesn't fair well.</p>
<p>Ashcroft succeeded.&nbsp; He served two terms as Governor of Missouri, then was elected to the Senate in 1994.&nbsp; He would have been re-elected in 2000 were it not for a plane crash in October that took the life of his opponent--the man who followed Ashcroft into Missouri's governor's mansion after the GOP candidate, William Webster, admitted to misappropriating government funds in his campaign to succeed Ashcroft.&nbsp; Webster would have won by a landslide were it not for the scandal, and the world would never have heard of Mel Carnahan.</p>
<p>But Webster was a crook, and Carnahan died just before the 2000 election.&nbsp; Missouri sentiment for the dead governor, whose son piloted the fatal flight, swept Widow Carnahan into the US Senate and Bob Holden, an affable dunce, into the governor's house.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After the contentious 2000 election, President Bush tapped the suddenly available Ashcroft as Attorney-General.&nbsp; Jim Talent, a rising Republic star, cooled his heels waiting to challenge Widow Carnahan for the seat that Missouri Republicans believed destined for Ashcroft.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On September 11, 2001, whoever was Attorney-General would become the most powerful since Lincoln's first term.&nbsp; The terrorism committed on American soil convinced lawmakers and citizens alike that our nation's law enforcement and interdiction agencies needed special powers to combat a threat to civilization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank God that the man in that role was a man of faith.&nbsp;His faith and subservience to God helped John Ashcroft walk the tightrope between chaos and tyranny.&nbsp; With skill, deft, and great good judgment, Ashcroft has played a key role in ensuring not a single terrorist attack on American soil in over&nbsp; three years.</p>
<p>As an American, I am as sorry to see him go as I am grateful for his service.&nbsp; As a Missouri, I beam proudly that one of my fellows made history by doing what is right.&nbsp; John Ashcroft weathered bitter, scathing assaults on his character.&nbsp; His faith, no doubt, his crutch.&nbsp; But his astonishing character, as well.</p>
<p>Godspeed, John.&nbsp; Welcome home.&nbsp; </p>
