<p>Jimmy Carter will probably attend Yassir Arafat's funeral service in Cairo, Egypt.&nbsp; How typical of the man who considers the American Revolution a low point in world history.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Yassir Arafat was a tyrant, a murderer, a thief, a shameless self-promoter, a liar, a welcher whose ego killed more Palestinians than all of Israel's weapons.&nbsp; While the UN and its amen chorus denounced Israel's terrorism fence and the poverty Israel supposedly forced upon the Palestinians, Arafat moved hundreds of million of dollars to France--money that might have alleviated Palestinian suffering.&nbsp; Instead of&nbsp;buying a Palestinian child's first pair of shoes, the money bought Arafat's wife her thousandth.</p>
<p>Like the Marcoses in the Philipines, the world will eventually come to see Arafat for what he was:&nbsp; a criminal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My grandmother used to say, Tell me who you go with, and I'll show you what you are.&nbsp; Jimmy Carter's closest friends are the most evil terrorists and dictators on the planet.&nbsp; His presence at Arafat's funeral will serve as a sign to God that Arafat deserve a special place in Hell.&nbsp; </p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=5293">Steven Taylor points out </a>that Arafat was as irresponsible with Palestinian peace as he was with Palestinian money.</p>
