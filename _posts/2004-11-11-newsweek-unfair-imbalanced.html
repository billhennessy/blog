<p>It's no surprise that the liberal MSM would smear John Ashcroft in his retirement as they've smeared him throughout his career.&nbsp; But Newsweek's coverage of Ashcroft is over the top.&nbsp; Their lead story, Ashcroft's legacy, is an interview with a single person, David Cole, who has a toolshedfull of axes to grind with the outgoing Attorney General.</p>
<p>While liberals always have and always will hate Ashcroft, make up stories about him, accuse him of everything from fascism to the Johnstown Flood, this treatment is beyond the pale.&nbsp; There is no pretense of balance, no sidebar with an Ashcroft supporter, not listing, however brief, of his accomplishments as the most powerful AG since the Civil War.&nbsp; Instead, Newsweek does DemocraticUnderground's job.</p>
<p>I guess, in this case, the MSM has decided the losers will write the history while the winners are still busy running a country and a war.</p>
