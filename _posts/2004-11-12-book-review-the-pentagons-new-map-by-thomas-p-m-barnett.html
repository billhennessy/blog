<p>American military policy as most of us know it evolved in response to the Cold War.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Soviet Union represented a military commanders worst nightmare:<span>&nbsp; </span>equal<span>&nbsp; </span>or superior strength in numbers, technology, and intelligence, combined with a desire to conquer the world.<span>&nbsp; </span></p></p>
<p>But, as we found in the 1990s, the Soviet Union was also a military commanders dream:<span>&nbsp; </span>a formidable adversary requiring American and NATO vigilance in the forms of large, new weapons systems, enormous training budgets, and hands-off intelligence programs.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the Soviet Union went away in 1991, the Pentagon found itself prepared for a war that would never happen, and unprepared for the many that did.</p></p>
<p>In The Pentagons New Map:<span>&nbsp; </span>War and Peace in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, Thomas P. M. Barnett, a Harvard educated political scientist who develops policy for the Pentagon and Navy War College, argues that the United States must radically overhaul its military.<span>&nbsp; </span>In a highly readable, extremely informative, and thought inspiring tome, Barnett explains the Cold War mentality with examples that render moot any argument to the contrary.</p></p>
<p>As a political scientist, Dr. Barnett attacks the problem of force allocation, training, and systems procurement holistically.<span>&nbsp; </span>His new map divides nations that have accepted globalization and its problems from those that have not.<span>&nbsp; </span>Militarily, he contends, he must look at the non-assimilated nations, not China, for our next confrontation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we must use our security commodities, including the military, to draw the reluctant nations into the world fold.</p></p>
<p>Dr. Barnett explains that September 11 surprised only some in the Pentagon.<span>&nbsp; </span>He and those who have adopted his view knew that the next Big Thing would come from a place that refused to join the world community and its rule sets.<span>&nbsp; </span>Operating with a bizarre set of rules designed to isolate itself from the world at large, Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran, and many African nations breed hatred for the assimilated world. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Combine poverty, ignorance, and anger with cutting-edge weapons systems, and you have Al-Qaeda and its kin.</p></p>
<p>Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the book for me is Dr. Barnetts skewering of Pentagon mentalities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having spent over 10 years in the military, I know the type Dr. Barnett battles in his daily policy work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ive never been able to explain them, though, to the civilian world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Barnett is a master at reducing the Cold War mentality to anecdote. </p></p>
<p>The Pentagons New Map is an essential piece to the puzzle that is the war on terror. </p>
