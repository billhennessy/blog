<p><a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=102&amp;topic_id=986515&amp;mesg_id=986595&amp;page=">Take a look.</a>&nbsp; These are the Blue Staters.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that&nbsp;from these lands come the people listed below?&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are compassionate, loving, meek, intelligent liberals writing.&nbsp; Read the rampant ignorance.&nbsp; Read the abuse of the language.&nbsp; Read the hatred, the discontent, the vile wishes of pain and suffering.&nbsp; Read the desire to abandon the United States.&nbsp; Read their minds, which they merrily open to the world the way a dirty old man reveals his naked body to school children.</p>
<p>These maggots&nbsp;praise Arafat and curse Cheney.&nbsp; They praise Usama bin Laden and curse American soldiers.&nbsp; They cheer at the deaths of our Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; They root for terrorism over democracy.&nbsp; They loathe people who believe in God.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is there a more vile, despicable, spoiled, whining, ignorant, unimaginative, hate-filled cretin in the world than an American liberal?&nbsp; I don't see how there could be.</p>
