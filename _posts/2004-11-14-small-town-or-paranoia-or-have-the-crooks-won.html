<p><a href="http://angelweave.mu.nu/archives/054744.html">Heather at Angelweave </a>has a delightful and thought provoking post about living in a small town where the activities known as asking for it are still just part of growing up.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I grew up in a not-so-safe neighborhood in South St. Louis, but&nbsp; my parents let me experience the kinds of freedoms Heather had in a small town in Michigan.&nbsp; So I was shocked when the cops stopped my 13-year-old from walking to school in one of the safest suburbs in St. Louis.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Maybe, instead of hiding ourselves and our kids behind walls, we should take back the damn streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want my kids to walk to school and to Schnucks and to Mobil for a Slushee.&nbsp; I want to put them on a bus to go to a baseball game.&nbsp; </p>
