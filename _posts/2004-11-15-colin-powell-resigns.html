<p>According to MSNBC, Secretary of State Colin Powell has submitted his resignation. </p>
<p>Having served as SoS during the most critical time since World War II, Powell must be exhausted.&nbsp; I am not Powell's biggest fan, having learned much about him from several of his lieutenants when he was still a general in the Army.&nbsp; But he did a remarkable job under very tough circumstances.&nbsp; He deserves our sincerest thanks for a life of service to his country. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I'm happy to hear Jack Danforth, our ambassador to the UN, is rumored as a replacement for Powell.&nbsp; Danforth is one of the truly upstanding people in Washington, and he's too good a man to be wandering the halls of the UN.&nbsp; As Secretary of State, Danforth would provide a level brilliant perspective that Powell lacked.&nbsp; Besides, being a fellow St. Louisan, I know Jack Danforth personally.&nbsp; I campaigned hard for him in is re-election battle with ultra-liberal Harriet Wood in 1982.&nbsp; As I mentioned in a previous post, Danforth's Lincoln Day party room featured an open bar, while Ashcroft's was serving soft drinks. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=5321">Poliblog </a>is linking to at least one story that names Condi Rice as the leading candidate to replace Powell.&nbsp; I've been hearing for months that Condi wants out of Washington altogether, but we shall see.&nbsp; The Bush foreign policy and security teams are worn out from the war on terror.&nbsp; I think someone fresh, like Danforth, would be the best choice.</p>
<p>ANOTHER UPDATE:&nbsp; I WAS WRONG!&nbsp; It's Condi.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; My sources obviously suck.&nbsp; (Nope--Secretary of State is just too big a job to say no to.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good call by <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com">Steven Taylor</a></p>
