<p>This Saturday, the Boy Scouts will be around to pick up the bags you filled with canned goods for their Scouting for Food program.&nbsp; Here's a list of the &#8220;perfect&#8221; bag:</p>
<p>After consulting with numerous food pantry directors in the area and seeking nutrition advice from Roberta Larson Duyff, a local registered dietitian and author of the <em>American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide</em>, we compiled what we like to call the Perfect Bag.&nbsp; The Perfect Bag contains variety of nutrient-rich foods from all five food groups.</p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>2 cans of hearty soup, stew or</strong> <strong>chili:</strong>&nbsp; Supplies many nutrients. </div>
<li>
<div><strong>2 cans of tuna, chicken, salmon or luncheon meat </strong>(e.g., Spam)<strong>:</strong> Contains protein and iron. Canned salmon is a source of calcium and omega-3 fatty acids.</div>
<li>
<div><strong>1 can of fruit:</strong> Supplies vitamins A and C, folate, potassium, fiber and other healthy substances.&nbsp; </div>
<li>
<div><strong>1 can of 100 percent&nbsp;pure fruit juice:</strong> Contains vitamin C and often beta carotene. </div>
<li>
<div><strong>1 can of vegetables:</strong> Supplies beta carotene, vitamin C, folate, complex carbohydrates, fiber and potassium.</div>
<li>
<div><strong>1 can of tomato or pasta sauce:</strong> Contains lycopene, a healthy substance that is more available to your body in canned and cooked tomatoes than in fresh.</div>
<li>
<div><strong>1 canned meal:</strong> Offers a variety of ingredients and nutrients.</div>
<li>
<div><strong>1 can of beans:</strong>&nbsp; Contains plenty of protein, complex carbohydrates and fiber .</div>
<li>
<div><strong>1 can of evaporated milk:</strong> Makes an excellent source of calcium and protein.</div>
</li>
</ul>
