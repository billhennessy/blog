<p>George Bush reaches into a frecas to extract one of his Secret Service agents in Chile.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let me repeat:&nbsp; The President of the United States rescued one of his body guards from a fight with other body guards.</p>
<p>George W. Bush is the coolest president since Teddy Roosevelt.&nbsp; These are the moments that define men at the pinnacle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  The president is supposed to walk away, seek the safety of other leaders and security agents.&nbsp; Instead, this man jumps into the fight to rescue his protector.&nbsp;
<p>Wow.&nbsp; Wow. Wow.</p>
<p>And don't miss the moronic reaction at <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=102&amp;topic_id=1009032&amp;mesg_id=1009032">DemocraticUnderground</a>, where idiots write that this was beneath the dignity of the office.&nbsp; More wow.&nbsp; Getting blow jobs from interns on Easter Sunday in the Oval Office is more honorable to these freaks than is rescuing a subordinate.&nbsp; How demonstrative. </p>
<p>Update:&nbsp; I'm not the only one who noticed.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1101023733.shtml">Dean's World</a></p>
