<p><a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/8347">Outside the Beltway</a> examines Michael Scheuer's column in Los Angeles Times.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One point I'd add:&nbsp; The reason American people are outraged over Clinton's failure to take out Bin Laden in 1998 and 1999 is that they don't know.&nbsp; The press did a fine job of filtering out any criticism of the Clinton admin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember Howard Fineman's admission in October? That the MSM would report only bad news about Iraq until the end of the campaign?&nbsp; Remember that Fineman's confession came on the heels of ABC's Mark Halprin's admonishment to treat Bush unevenly?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Well, Mr. Scheuer, if you want outrage, you'll have to write another book and THIS TIME tell the truth instead of sucking up to the MSM.&nbsp; <img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=463" width="1" height="1"></p>
