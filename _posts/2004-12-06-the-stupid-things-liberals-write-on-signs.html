<p><a href="http://soubriquet.net/photos/2003/feb15.php?page=19">This is from a peace rally somewhere</a>.&nbsp; Does this Nancyboy Junior Lefty really look he needs someone to tell him not to bully weaker kids?&nbsp; And do his teachers ask him whether Saddam bullied people?&nbsp; Perhaps he should learn about the brides Saddam's sons routinely raped on their wedding nights.&nbsp; Perhaps he should learn about the mass graves in Kurdish north.&nbsp; Perhaps he should be lifting weights instead of holding idiotic signs that make him look like a pansy.&nbsp; </p>
