<p class="MsoNormal">I dont know what gets the blamepolitical correctness, pop culture, declining understanding of the subtleties of language, or just timebut I miss some words.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wish people used them more often.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<br /><strong>Spat</strong>and the past of other verbs that end with -it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead of spat, I hear only spit used for any tense.<span>&nbsp; </span>He spat on me, lends an air of dignity that he spit on me lacks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Spittle</strong>another victim of the ubiquitous verb.<span>&nbsp; </span>Spittle is a noun.<span>&nbsp; </span>The umpire recognized the foreign substance as the pitchers spittle.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Lend</strong>a verb eaten by its noun cousin, loan.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lend me a dollar, says the intelligent young man.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Grand</strong>Holden Caulfield destroyed this fine, old word.<span>&nbsp; </span>We had a grand time at the party.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Shindig</strong>still pops up now an then, but not enough.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Too many parties; not enough shindigs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Shenanigans</strong>once used to describe inappropriate behavior; this excellent word exists only on the hunter green awnings of semi-Irish sports bars in every city in America.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lets take it down from the awning and into our conversations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Gal</strong>The other night, I used the word gal in a sentence, and my wife asked, how old <i>are</i> you?<span>&nbsp; </span>Gal has a cool, Sinatra sound to it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I saw Joey out with some gal last night, piques interests much faster than I saw Joey with a girl or woman or chick or on a date or any other word youd care to substitute.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gal says as much about the speaker as it does the object.<span>&nbsp; </span>People who say gal drink scotch and smile a lot. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Tomfoolery</strong>What a fine, fine word.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tomfoolery will get you hurt, while shenanigans will hurt others.</p>
