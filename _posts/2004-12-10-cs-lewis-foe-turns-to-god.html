<p>The 20th Century's two giant defenders of Christian faith--C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton--both turned to Christianity from atheism.&nbsp; Chesterton fought G. B. Shaw over God's existence.&nbsp; C.S. Lewis fought, among others, Antony Flew. </p>
<p>Flew, now 81 years old, made his name scoffing at the silliness of people who "believe in a ghost in the clouds."&nbsp; A professor of philosophy, Flew demanded proof of God's existence before he would believe--or let others believe unchallenged.&nbsp; (A common thing with atheists is the insistance that no one else believe in God, either.)</p>
<p>According to an Associated Press story on <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=315976">ABCNews.com</a>, linked by <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At age 81, after decades of insisting belief is a mistake, Antony Flew has concluded that some sort of intelligence or first cause must have created the universe. A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature, Flew said in a telephone interview from England.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the light side, Antony.&nbsp; When you get to that special place, I'm sure George MacDonald, G.K. Chesterton, and Jack Lewis will have a whiskey waiting.&nbsp; </p>
