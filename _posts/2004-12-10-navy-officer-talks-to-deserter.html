<p>In an open letter to deserter Pablo Paredes, <a href="http://www.indepundit.com/archive2/2004/12/an_open_letter.html">SMASH </a>tells the silly bastard how it really is.</p>
<p>I hope this kid matures enough to feel the shame he brought upon himself by taking a cowardly way out of hard work. I'd like to see his just war theory as written prior to 9/11.&nbsp; If he just "invented" his pacifism since the possibility of fighting came about, he's a coward and a traitor who should be taken out and shot.&nbsp; </p>
