<p class="MsoNormal">TOP OF PAGE UPDATE!&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font class="text"><br />
The <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000735190">editor of Pitts's newspaper speaks</a>:<br />
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font class="text"><br />
</font></p>
<div><font class="text">"He is there to write stories, not make news<br />
himself," Griscom said of Pitts. The editor added that the recipient of<br />
the e-mail, whom he would not identify, should not have passed it<br />
along. </p>
<p></font></div>
<p>The recipient should not have passed it along?&nbsp; Good God, Mr.<br />
Griscom.&nbsp; It's called NEWS!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; That's how a lot of<br />
news gets made--someone does something unethical and gets caught<br />
because their ego demands that they pound their chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks, again to Drudge.&nbsp; (Links below)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font class="text"><br />
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flashcp.htm">Drudge broke the story</a> of Chattanooga Times Free Press reporter Edward Lee, who planted the armor soldiers at Donald Rumsfelds press conference.<span>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001373.php">InDC Journal has this</a>. And he points out <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/000974.htm">Michelle Malkin's observations</a>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pitts, who is embedded with 278th Regimental Combat Team in Kuwait and preparing to enter Iraq, smugly describes his ADA-style activism:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I<br />
was told yesterday that only soldiers could ask questions so I brought<br />
two of them along with me as my escorts. Before hand we worked on<br />
questions to ask Rumsfeld about the appalling lack of armor their<br />
vehicles going into combat have. While waiting for the VIP, I went and<br />
found the Sgt. in charge of the microphone for the question and answer<br />
session and made sure he knew to get my guys out of the crowd.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His scheme worked.<span>&nbsp; </span>In his own words, Mr. Pittss set up stole the show:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The<br />
great part was that after the event was over the throng of national<br />
media following Rumsfeld- The New York Times, AP, all the major<br />
networks -- swarmed to the two soldiers I brought from the unit I am<br />
embedded with.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I love this story.<span>&nbsp; </span>During<br />
the campaign, over and over, the press tried to manufacture news that<br />
would hurt Bushthe Guard memos, the missing explosives, etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>And<br />
time after time, the poorly conceived deceptions unraveled within 24<br />
hours, boosting the Presidents popularity and exposing the press as<br />
little more than an arm of the Democrat party.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now, here comes this little Mr. Pitts from Tennessee.<br />
He finds a couple of malcontents in his unitand every military unit<br />
has some malcontentswrites down a political statement in the form of a<br />
question for them to read, and electronically struts about, fists<br />
pumping, screaming I da man!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some of the men in 278th arent malcontents.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of them will resent Pittss underhanded scheme to embarrass the SECDEF and damage morale in the ranks.<span>&nbsp; </span>No<br />
one will hold it against those men if they fail to provide Mr. Pitts<br />
with the best equipment, best training, best advice, and best<br />
protection when the terrorists come to kill.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Liberals will consider Pittss actions heroic, but I dont.<span>&nbsp; </span>If he dies in Iraq, hell die a loser.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span></span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://reporterette.blogspot.com/2004/12/reporter-bias-revealed.html">Michelle Malkin adds this link.</a></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>UPDATE 2:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/8393">Outside the Beltway is skeptical</a>. But skepticism is unwarranted, as <a href="http://www.whnt19.com/Global/story.asp?S=2672925">Pitt's newspaper has published an Attaboy </a>for its reporter <em>***</em> activist.&nbsp; <br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>UPDATE 3:&nbsp; Let's line this up for the Beltway Traffic Jam<br />
