<p><span>Just after the election, America's hysterian, Paul Krugman, promised to leave us alone while he came to grips with an especially bruising defeat--Krugman, in the inner recesses of his limited mind, believed the election was a referendum on . . . him.&nbsp; Anyway, his sabbatical didn't last long.&nbsp; He published two op-ed pieces in the New York Times this week, both railing against partial privatization of Social Security.</span></p>
<p><span>His argument?&nbsp; There is no Social Security crisis.&nbsp; Everything's fine; won't you pass the broccoli, dear?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Yes, the same Krugman who, in 1996, predicted the collapse of Western Civilization under the weight of Boomer retirements, now says we are crisis-free until 2052, when a mere quadrupling of individual income taxes will solve the problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Krugman is especially hard on the stock market.&nbsp; According to his economical models, you see, the stock market always returns a loss, while government bonds always return a gain.&nbsp; He's correct that if individuals used all of their discretionary social security investment money to buy government bonds, the net would be zero.&nbsp; But only an idiot would assume that diversifying the social security trust fund and applying a little dollar-cost averaging would reduce its value over 40 years.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>There are two sure investments in America:&nbsp; homes and stocks.&nbsp; Yes, you can buy a lousy home or a lousy stock.&nbsp; But if you buy a hundred homes or a hundred stocks, chances are you'll come out way ahead twenty years hence.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Krugman would be well advised to return to his vacation cottage in the woods of Connecticut, whereto whittle away the hours counting his returns on t-bills. </span></p>
<p>Krugman's latest eruption is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/10/opinion/10krugman.html">here</a>.</p>
