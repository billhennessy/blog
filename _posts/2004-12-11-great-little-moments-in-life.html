<p>My wife prepared for a day trip to Granite City, Illinois, to see her<br />
parents and get her hair done at her favorite salon.&nbsp; I needed<br />
smokes and a coffee, so I drove to the nearby Mobil On the Run.&nbsp;<br />
As I emerged from the store, a beautiful woman with eyes like a<br />
Scandinavian model approached my left flank turned me, and planted a<br />
kiss that sent my mind swirling in confused happiness.</p>
<p>Of course, the woman was my wife.&nbsp; She'd stopped for gas and<br />
recognized my Explorer in the parking lot.&nbsp; Under the gray,<br />
snow-threatening skies of a December Saturday morning, I saw jealous<br />
men glance at us from the corner of my eye.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Moments like these cannot be caught, bought, or captured. They are<br />
little moments of pure joy that remind us that God reveals Himself at<br />
odd times and in unexpected ways.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks, God.&nbsp; That little kiss will sustain me for months.&nbsp; <br /><img src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=858" width="1" height="1"></p>
