<p>Well, the blogosphere's finally noticing Crichton's new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hennesssview-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0066214130%2Fqid%3D1102908263%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_csp_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846">State of Fear</a> .</p>
<p><a href="http://www.econopundit.com/archive/2004_12_01_econopundit_archive.html#110285639301022181">Econopundit </a>has some interesting data, and<a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2003/12/16/823.aspx"> I smelled this </a>coming a year ago.</p>
<p>Nod to <a href="http://www.instapundit.com">Instapundit</a>&nbsp;who has more links like <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/04_12_12_corner-archive.asp#047920">this one</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1102929591.shtml">Dean Esmay</a> </a>has a long, thoughtful piece on global warming inspired by things other than Crichton.&nbsp; Money quotes that match Crichton's speech at CalTech:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to global warming there are three facts that I'm often amazed don't get more attention:</p>
<p>1) Most climate scientists are fairly certain that the Earth's average temperature has been higher any number of times in the past than it is now, and</p>
<p>2) Most climate scientists will affirm that atmospheric CO2 levels have been much higher at times in the past than they are now.</p>
<p>3) There's not much evidence that CO2 levels and average atmospheric temperature are more than marginally correlated.</p>
<p>And one of the bigger bombshells of the last year was when the most commonly cited study on atmospheric temperature trends over the last millenium to demonstrate a sharp recent increase in global temperatures <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/04/10/wo_muller101504.asp"><u><font>was shown to be mathematically flawed</font></u></a>.</p>
