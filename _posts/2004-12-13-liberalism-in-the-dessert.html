<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1102878055.shtml">Joe Gandelman writing on Dean's World</a>, I just read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56434-2004Dec10.html?sub=AR">George Will's </a>attempt at restoring sanity to liberalism and its party, the DNC.&nbsp; In this analysis, Will blames the stockpiling losses on liberalsm's condescension, disrespect, and distrust of most Americans.</p>
<p>Will uses as an example a quote from Robert Kuttner writing in the leftist American Prospect:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bill Clinton won election by declaring, as a matter of values, that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be poor. Middle America forgave him for treating gays as people." </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As Will put it, </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kuttner could not resist a spasm of moral vanity. He had to disparage "middle America," which means most of America, as so bigoted it denies the humanity of gays."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Liberalism's snottiness toward "normal" people runs through <a href="http://left2right.typepad.com/main/">Left2Right</a>, a new liberal blog site which I blogrolled because some of the authors seem reasonable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Reasonable, not right.&nbsp; In other words, they are reasonable in their explanation of the ignorance of their opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least the folks on DemocraticUnderground believe conservatives are smart enough to rig elections, assassinate presidents, and invent AIDS as a means to elminate blacks and gays.&nbsp; And, to them, we're smart enough to not get caught, even though "everybody knows" we did it. </p>
<p>I'm not so sure liberalism will recover any time soon.&nbsp; The movement liberals who make up <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2004/12/10/844.aspx">MoveOn.org </a>and post on <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.org/">DemocraticUnderground </a>aren't really interested in winning elections.&nbsp; They think we mass in the middle unworthy of their cures.&nbsp; Better to remain the disgruntled powerless than rule swine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have to admit I'm enjoying this immensely.&nbsp; Liberalism has damaged millions of lives through welfare-enslavement, support for communism, support for terrorism, and destruction of the founders' Constitution.&nbsp; While others, like Will, feel compelled to reach out a helping hand, I'm content to sit back and let the smug bastards twist in the wind. </p>
