<p>Regulars know that I rarely invoke the memory of William Jeffersonovich Clinton for the same reason I don't I say "must win situation" when the Blues are down 3 - 1 in the Stanley Cup Finals.&nbsp; It's a cliche.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nonetheless, news in today's <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/worldnews/36359.htm">New York Post</a> that Marc Rich, the most controversial of Clinton's Midnight Pardons, was a major player in the Oil for Food scam with Saddam.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich, the fugitive Swiss-based commodities trader who received a controversial pardon from President Bill Clinton in January 2001, is a primary target of criminal probes under way in the U.S. attorney's office in New York and by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, sources said. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If true, Clinton's tarnished legacy will suffer true corrosion.&nbsp; In case you don't remember, Marc Rich, who was primarily wanted for evading millions in taxes, has done a lot of work to help America's enemies for his own, personal gain.&nbsp; By contributing large sums of illegal money through his wife to the DNC, Rich bought himself a Clinton pardon, allowing him to return to the United States.</p>
<p>I hope he is indicted and found guilty of these charges.&nbsp; Poetic justice demands that he spend the rest of his life behind bars. Perhaps a reasonable restitution would 100% of his net worth to the new Iraqi government. </p>
