<p>The combination of Michael Crichton's recent publicity and <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1102929591.shtml">Dean's Nature of Science </a>blog has me thinking about environmentalism.</p>
<p>Few leftist utterings irritate me more than the environmental nonsense that I've heard since about 1990.&nbsp; It all started with my knowledge of freon, particularly R-12 and R-114.&nbsp; I spent 10 years in the submarine force.&nbsp; Freon is a very dangerous gas on submarines because of its weight and its tendancy to turn into phosgene gas upon heating.&nbsp; </p>
<p>CFCs, including everything collectively known as Freon, weigh between 4 and 8 times the weight of atomosphere.&nbsp; They do not rise, ever.&nbsp; On a submarine, with it's enclosed environment, a small freon leak will displace oxygen in lower level bilges.&nbsp; A sailor working in these spaces may quickly suffocate, or, should he light a cigarette, <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/phosgene/basics/facts.asp">produce phosgene gas that absorbs even through skin</a>--it's why the Nazis used it in death camps. </p>
<p>Ponder that weight:&nbsp; 4 to 8 times heavier than atmosphere.&nbsp; In the Navy, we used powerful Red Devil blowers to suck freon out of void spaces.&nbsp; We could only use this technique when we were in port, because the freon had to discharge overboard, else we would merely move it to a different bilge.&nbsp; We ran the blowers for hours--4-8--before workers were allowed to enter the spaces.&nbsp; That's how heavy the stuff is. </p>
<p>Freon drops through air like rain drops.&nbsp; The only way to get freon into the ozone layer is to pack it into a plane, fly above the ozone layer, and release it, causing it to fall through the ozone layer.&nbsp; Since we don't do that, the ban on R-12 stacks up as one of the most idiotic junk science spasms in Congress's history.</p>
<p>For more read <a href="http://www.junkscience.com/may99/freon.htm">this </a>and <a href="http://www.letsplay.net/josday/getdonday.cfm?id=128">this</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Over lunch, I read the first 2.5 chapters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hennesssview-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0066214130%2Fqid%3D1102908263%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_csp_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846">State of Fear</a> .&nbsp; So far, this book would make a great Christmas gift for anyone.&nbsp; I'm wondering if any Hollywood producer would touch the movie rights with a 39 1/2 foot pole, though.&nbsp; Maybe Mel Gibson.&nbsp; It reads much like a Nelson DeMille novel.&nbsp; I'll post a full review when I finish the book--possibly tonight.&nbsp; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Nelson DeMille's latest work, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hennesssview-20&amp;path=ASIN%2F0446576638%2Fqid%3D1102965357%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_ka_b_2_1">Night Fall</a> , is also in bookstores.</p>
