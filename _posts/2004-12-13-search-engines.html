<p>What in God's holy name does the Microsoft search engine do?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I can type the exact same entry into three or four separate engines and get back, more or less, the same results.&nbsp; Then, I enter the same search--langa cleanxp--into MSN's search and get back goofy results.&nbsp; I've noticed this for a couple of years, but since launching their "new" search engine in November, the problem seems to be getting worse.</p>
