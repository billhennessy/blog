<p>Catholic parishes in St. Louis, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=519&amp;ncid=718&amp;e=10&amp;u=/ap/20041213/ap_on_re_us/activist_parishioner">Boston</a>, and other US cities are closing for financial reasons.&nbsp; The church, you see, lost income and paid millions in judgements and settlements to victims of its child-molester priests.</p>
<p>Parishoners are rebelling, though.&nbsp; In St. Louis, the archdioces ordered St. Stanislaus Polish parish to turn over its assets to the archdioces.&nbsp; The parish said "no," appealed to the Vatican, and lost.&nbsp; The parishoners continue to fight the turnover.</p>
<p>In north St. Louis County, a dozen parishes and schools are slated for closure, inlcuding some of the oldest and best-attended.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Boston, Catholics are getting angry.</p>
<p>This is a sad story, and the church can blame no one but the American Catholic Bishops who spent 30 years shuffling pedophile priests from one diocese to another to avoid prosecutions.&nbsp; The dioceses publicly denied rumors of the sex abuse, paying hush money to vicitms families.</p>
<p>The Pope should have stepped in 20 years ago.&nbsp; He didn't.&nbsp; Trusting his American Bishops to fix their problems, he turned a blind eye to the problem as the hunters sought out and found new prey in new parishes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When the extent of the problem hit the news, shocked Catholics stopped giving to the church.&nbsp; Why pay child molesters?&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Catholic community in St. Louis in shambles.&nbsp; Shortly, South St. Louis will find out that nearly half of its parishes will close.&nbsp; The power and anger of South Side Catholics will raise the fight to a new level.&nbsp; As time goes on, Catholics will find the church is more of a burden to their lives than blessing, and many will turn to other denominations or sects, like Bishops LeFebvre's church or Heartland Catholics or Episcopalian or Lutheran.&nbsp; The Roman Catholic church will shrink, and in a scramble to restore its past lustre will ordain married men and permit priests to marry.</p>
<p>I fought for celibate priests all of my life, especially during my 15 years in Catholic schools.&nbsp; But I have changed my mind.&nbsp; In order to save the church, we must ordain married men.&nbsp; And soon. </p>
