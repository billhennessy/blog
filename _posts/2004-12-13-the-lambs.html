<p>It's 1998 all over again in Ram country.</p>
<p>Today, playing with a 3rd string running back, Arlen Harris, and a delapidated quarter, Chris Chandler, the Rams threw six--count 'em, six--interceptions to the Carolina Panthers, all but forcing the Panthers to win.</p>
<p>The Rams gave up 3 opportunities to kick field goals, which would have made the score 20-16 late in the 4th quarter.&nbsp; As usual, they managed the clock poorly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Rams' roster sports six first round draft choices unable to play because they have no talent.&nbsp; Perhaps Mike Martz has good numbers as a head coach, but his mismanagement of drafts, free agents, clocks, and play calling deserves scrutiny.&nbsp; Since 2000, when he took over as head coach, the Rams have imploded.&nbsp; If Martz isn't to blame, who is?&nbsp; </p>
