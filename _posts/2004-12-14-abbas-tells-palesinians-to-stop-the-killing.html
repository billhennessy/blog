<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;e=5&amp;u=/ap/20041214/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_palestinians">Mahmoud Abbas,</a> the likeliest successor to Yassir Arafat, has called on Palestinians to lay down their arms.</p>
<p>When Arafat's death proves sufficient to reduce tensions in the Middle East and maybe give some Israelis and Palestinians a chance to live out their lives without daily terror, the United Nations and its amen corner in America and France will look like idiots for fawning over Arafat so many years.</p>
<p>Arafat was a terrorist, self-serving hate-monger.&nbsp; A murder of children.&nbsp; He deserves the firey hell into which God surely cast him.&nbsp; </p>
