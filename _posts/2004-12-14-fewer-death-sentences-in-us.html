<p><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041214/D86V3OD01.html">American juries are awarding the death penalty</a> with decreasing frequency these days.&nbsp; Good news.</p>
<p><span>I have vacillated on the death penalty for several years, beginning with witnessing the implosion of the old St. Louis Arena.&nbsp; (Long story.)&nbsp; But let's give credit where it's due:&nbsp; </span>the death penalty itself.</p>
<p>Never having been a proponent of the deterrent of the death penalty, I have maintained that capital punishment can be defended on two grounds:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Some crimes deserve elimination of the perpetrator.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Society must, occasionally, demonstrate its abhorrence with an individual by his execution.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons the death penalty is in decline is because we have already killed a lot of the individuals who fit category 2.&nbsp; Additionally, the correlation between our large prison population and our 50-year low crime rates is too obvious to miss, except for liberals, who believe that crime is low because of global warming. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I found<a href="http://afterabortion.blogspot.com/2004/12/pro-life-but-nothing-scott-peterson.html"> this interesting piece </a>from Annie on AA.</p>
