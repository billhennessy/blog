<p>Several bloggers have noted the stories that Taliban fighters, after three long years of ducking and running, are about ready to lay down their arms and become responsible citizens in a the world's newest democracy.</p>
<p>Whether or not exhaustion gets the credit, <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041214/D86VE9KG0.html">US and Afghan military have captured </a>two high value targets, including Mullah Omar's personal security chief.</p>
<p>With these arrests, perhaps we'll finally nab Omar.&nbsp; My guess is that, if he knows anything about Bin Laden's whereabouts, he'll sing.&nbsp; </p>
