<p>I thought Pablo the deserter would turn out a pseudo-intelletual lefty.&nbsp; Well, an English major he is not.&nbsp; </p>
<p><em>The qualification process for doing most of my duties is over 6 months (the length of the deployment)and so i [sic] would of [sic] mainly been training and get[t]ing qualified, which in some ways is more of a burden than assistance. It is also likely that my early out chit would have been approved after the deployment . . . </em></p>
<p>Is it "would of" or "would have," Pablo?&nbsp; Actually, he used "would of" at least twice, so I guess he's sticking with option A.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Read this self-serving <a href="http://www.indepundit.com/archive2/2004/12/sea_lawyer.html">bastard's idiotic response to Smash</a>, and Smash's glorious rebuttal.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1102993976.shtml">Dean.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jquinton.com/archives/002274.html">Backcountry Conservative </a>provides a <a href="http://www.shortfamilyonline.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=440">link to another Pablo response</a>.&nbsp; While this guy lacks the time and spine to fulfill his obligation to his country, he sure has plenty of time for blogging. </p>
