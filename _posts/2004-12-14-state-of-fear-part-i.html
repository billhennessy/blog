<p>I've finished the first 100 or so pages of Michael Crichton's new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hennesssview-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0066214130%2Fqid%3D1102908263%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_csp_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846">State of Fear</a>.&nbsp; Since I've been blogging about the book for a week, I owe some thoughts.</p>
<p>First, the story has grabbed me.&nbsp; The action begins quickly.&nbsp; While some reviewers have crticized the number of characters and the variety of venues, I&nbsp;find the pace excellent. </p>
<p>Second, if you're looking for massive debunking of wacko global warming theories, the book will start slowly.&nbsp; That's a good thing.&nbsp; So far, I don't find it preaching, though the main character, a young lawyer at a firm that specializes in earth-friendly clients with deep pockets, is a bit too cookie-cutter of a limousine liberal.</p>
<p>Third, this represents&nbsp;my first Crichton book, so I must address his skill in the craft.&nbsp; As a writer, Michael Crichton makes&nbsp;a good scientist and doctor.&nbsp; While his story, so far, engages me, his mastery of the language wants something.&nbsp; I surmise that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hennesssview-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0066214130%2Fqid%3D1102908263%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_csp_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846">State of Fear</a> raced through the editorial process at Harper-Collins without much editorial scrutiny.&nbsp; Crichton's credentials for commercially lucrative books precedes him, even if human dialogue does not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>True, my criticism covers only the first one hundred, fifteen pages.&nbsp; Were this a first novel, I would hold my tongue until the end--or until a second or third work.&nbsp; But Crichton's credits include thirteen fiction and four nonfiction works.&nbsp; You don't learn dialogue on book fifteen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While on the negatives, I might as well mention that I like word pictures.&nbsp; I want to see, hear, smell, and feel the characters' worlds.&nbsp; Crichton doesn't do that.&nbsp; I have no idea what Peter Evans's apartment looks like, even though Crichton tried to tell me:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Evans lived in one of the older apartment buildings on Roxbury Drive in the flats of Beverly Hills.&nbsp; There were four units in his building, across&nbsp; the street from Roxbury Park.&nbsp; It was a nice park, a big green expanse, always busy.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Could a police artist create a useful sketch from that description?&nbsp; Hardly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Crichton's description of beautiful women ends with the word beautiful and a scant note of complexion, hair color, and eyes.&nbsp; Oh, and "white teeth."&nbsp; On the other hand, he took the time to describe one woman's hands:&nbsp; "She had beautiful fingers."&nbsp; Does that really tell me anything about her fingers?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Why not, "Marshall could not watch the choreographed moves of her fingers without wanting them on him. Silently, he begged for her touch." </p>
<p>But Crichton's lack of details serves one purpose well:&nbsp; it leaves interpretation open for Hollywood directors.&nbsp; In his interview with ABC's 20/20 on Friday, and already twice in the first hundred pages, Crichton advises us to follow the money when sizing up environmental causes.&nbsp; I suspect we can follow much of Crichton's visually sparse writing to a movie studio.</p>
<p>Do not let my literary snobbishness stop you from reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hennesssview-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0066214130%2Fqid%3D1102908263%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_csp_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846">State of Fear</a>. As I said, the story moves with engrossing pace, even if the writing and characters seem thin.&nbsp; I still recommend the book. </p>
