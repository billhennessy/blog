<p>Yesterday, I linked to a story about the decline in death sentences in the US. That reminded me of a post from last June about<a href="http://forgivenforlife.com/journal.html"> David Berkowitz</a>.&nbsp; Then I found <a href="http://afterabortion.blogspot.com/2004/12/pro-life-but-nothing-scott-peterson.html">Annie's piece on After Abortion</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I still haven't reached a new decision on the death penalty.&nbsp; I'm in a no-man's land where I want the death penalty to be available to juries, but I don't that I could ever condemn a stranger.&nbsp; I could kill someone who needed to be killed for the safety and welfare of myself or society or family.&nbsp; But I would have a very hard time voting to kill someone.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoy reading Berkowitz's journal.&nbsp; The entries are very Christian, so, if that offends, read them all.&nbsp; I'd love to read other's reactions to these stories.&nbsp; Let me know if anyone else has posted about the death penalty lately.</p>
