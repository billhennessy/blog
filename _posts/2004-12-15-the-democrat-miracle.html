<p>Ron Bilancia has a long post on <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/04/12/14_miracle.html">DemocraticUnderground.org </a>that attempts to use the movie "Miracle," about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team, as roadmap for the Democrat party.</p>
<p>I agree with&nbsp; much of what Ron writes, but why are Democrats so godawful afraid to say "We're Americans?"</p>
<p>Bilancia catches most of the keys to the 1980 team's success:&nbsp;brilliant coach, team play, focus, creativity, hard work, working for something outside yourself, and staying on the offensive.&nbsp; But he missed the 1980 team's turning point--something that our women's gymnastics team did not.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/8458">*********Check out the Beltway Traffic Jam*********************</a></p>
<p>Watching some gymnasitcs event early in the Athens Summer Games, the camera focused in on our girls in a circle, preparing for an event. It was a pep talk, and it ended with one of the girls asking, "What team do we play for?"&nbsp; Her mates responded, "we play for the United States of America!"</p>
<p>Throughout the movie "Miracle," coach Herb Brooks would ask his players what team they played for.&nbsp; "Boston College,"&nbsp; "Minnesota," "University of Michigan," they would answer.&nbsp; The players resented their coach for his lack of interest.&nbsp; Though he asked, he didn't really care for the answer, because the next time the guy screwed up, Brooks would have to ask him, again.&nbsp; "When is he ever going to remember which teams we play for?&nbsp; Hell, he coached against half of us."</p>
<p>During a pre-Olympic tour of Europe, the American team was humiliated by&nbsp; . . . Norway?&nbsp; After the lackluster performance, Brooks made the team skate lines for hours.&nbsp; The players were exhausted, vomiting, dead.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(I once played in a summer league in Bolton, Connecticut, for a Navy team.&nbsp;Most games we'd have only 7 skaters.&nbsp; We had a rule that you could only come off the ice when someone on the bench waved you off or you had to throw up.&nbsp; Usuallly, it was the latter.&nbsp; I felt for the guys.)</p>
<p>Mike Eruzione figured it out just as the team doctor was ready to pronounce them all dead.</p>
<p>"Ask me what team I play for, coach,"&nbsp; he demanded of Brooks.</p>
<p>"What team do you play for?"</p>
<p>"I play for the United States of America."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Bilancia knows the importance of this moment to the team--his section on "Unite" clearly derives from this--he fails, as liberals always do, to make the distinction that Eruzione made:&nbsp; We play for the United States of America.&nbsp; Bilancia thinks uniting as liberals and progressives, as Democrats and Greens, is the kind of unity his party needs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He's wrong.</p>
<p>If the Dems want to know why they keep losing, why middle America doesn't trust them with the keys to the country, it's right there.&nbsp; Liberals play for the Poor, Blacks, Women, Gays, the Environment, Peace, Living Wages, Pay Equity, Casual Abortion, and the United Nations.&nbsp;When John Kerry says something blandly patriotic in a fit of desparation, you can almost see the words hastily written on the index card as his eyes move across the letters.&nbsp; It's forced and borrowed and insincere and scripted and, somehow, blasphemous.</p>
<p>I wish some reporter had asked Kerry that question.&nbsp; I'd love to hear the three minute, convoluted response.&nbsp; I would have no more idea what it meant had he said than I do imagining it now.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But if someone asked George Bush what team he plays for, I harbor no&nbsp;doubt that his answer would be, "I play for the United States of America!"</p>
<p>Until American liberals decide to be Americans first, they will continue see their beloved central government under the management of the American Team. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Well, maybe one liberal has.&nbsp; This piece by<a href="http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2004/12/on_patriotism.html"> Elizabeth Anderson on Left2Right </a>is worth a read.&nbsp; Ms. Anderson seems to get it in a way that many on her cannot not--viscerally.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1102844706.shtml">Dean agrees</a>.</p>
