<p>I know that <a href="http://www.komo4.com/stories/34416.htm">stories about atheists being idiots</a> should neither surprise<br />
nor upset me.&nbsp; But I'd really like beat the living hell out of the<br />
s.o.b.s who want the "Giving Tree" taken down</p>
<p>While I'm at it, I wouldn't mind punching whoever called it a "Giving Tree" instead of a Christmas Tree.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>"I try and be aware of injustice and inequality when it effects anybody<br />
or everybody," he says. "Certainly this is something that has been a<br />
problem for as long as I can remember."</p></blockquote>
<p>Screw the offended, and Sidney Stock, the lifeless nosebleed who<br />
wants the tree taken down.&nbsp; What injustice?&nbsp; For the love of<br />
God, Mr. Stock, live a little.&nbsp; If you think a tree is injustice,<br />
you ain't been around.</p>
