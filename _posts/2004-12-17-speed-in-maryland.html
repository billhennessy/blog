<p><a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2004/12/06/460.aspx">Last week</a>, I came across the news story about 12 homes under construction set ablaze in Maryland and used it to discuss eco-terrorism.&nbsp; Yesterday, <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041217/D871EG3O0.html">authorities arrested a man named Aaron Speed</a>.&nbsp; He is not known as an eco-terrorist, and apparently had no motive.&nbsp; Speeds works as a security guard protecting the home allegedly torched.</p>
<p>Something seems wrong here.&nbsp; While Speed has a history of mental illness, he reminds me of the guy they arrested in Atlanta for detonating a bomb during the Olympics.&nbsp; In that case, they got the wrong guy by overreaching in the search for a motive.&nbsp; Authorities believed <a href="http://www.historychannel.com/speeches/archive/speech_461.html">Richard Jewell </a>planted the bomb in order to be seen a hero.&nbsp; So far, no possible motive has been given for Speed to set fire to the homes.</p>
<p>We'll see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the evidence disclosed thus far, I would be surprised if Speed ever goes to trial. </p>
