<p>Time Magazine's Man of the Year title often makes a mockery of the honor.&nbsp; Remember the PC?&nbsp; </p>
<p>This year, though, Time's editors got it right.&nbsp; Tempted, no doubt, to embarrass their political enemy, the editors took the high road by selecting George W. Bush, the most remarkable President in half a century, as its Man of the Year, 2004.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>For sticking to his guns (literally and figuratively), for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his ten-gallon-hat leadership style and for persuading a majority of voters that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years, George W. Bush is TIME's 2004 Person of the Year</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every conservtive or Republican over 35 hails Ronald Reagan as the greatest President since Roosevelt.&nbsp; I agree. But George W. Bush's mark will be a deeper one.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will define the president for the next 50 years, the way Roosevelt did from the Depression to the end of the Cold War. </p>
<p>While Reagan displaced Roosevelt's reign as the image of a president, Reagan's era was a short one.&nbsp; W has eclipsed Reagan already, and he's only half way done.&nbsp; </p>
