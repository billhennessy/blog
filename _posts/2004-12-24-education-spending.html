<p>Did you know that no study has ever shown a correlation between quality of education and per-pupil <a href="http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=14171">spending among public schools</a>?</p>
<p>Did you know that in <a href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cb_26.htm">New York City, only 55% of education budget goes to instruction</a>?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Did you know that the higher the administrators to students ratio, the worse the education?</p>
<p>Did you know that <a href="http://www.aasa.org/publications/sa/1997_10/achilles_side_research.htm">teacher to pupil ratio is a lousy predictor of education </a>quality?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Did you know that three of the worst school districts in the country are in the top five in spending per pupil?</p>
<p>Did you know that the quality of education is significantly lower in Blue States than in Red States?</p>
