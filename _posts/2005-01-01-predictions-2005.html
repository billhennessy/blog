<p>Last year, I hit about .500 on my predictions using my own, friendly measures.&nbsp; This year, though, is a bit tougher without an election to predict.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Tsunami</strong></p>
<p>The disease outbreak won't be as bad as the fearmongers at the UN hope.&nbsp; Still, the total human damage from the quakes will reach 200,000--a massive loss of life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The UN and the Bush Administration will have their final, irreparable falling-out over Bush's coalition of aid.&nbsp; Bush will divert billions from UN programs into US-led programs for this and other world problems, undermining the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Economy</strong></p>
<p>In the first quarter, incomes will rise faster than expected, fueling a powerful second quarter.&nbsp; By July first, the major stock indexes will hit my predictions for last year:&nbsp; Dow 12,000, NASDAQ 2,500.&nbsp; By the end of the year, unemployment will stand at 5.1%, the deficit for 2006 will be cut in half from current projections, 1.8 million new jobs will have been created, and the Dow will close 2005 at 13,187.&nbsp; NASDAQ will close at 2,994, just missing the 3,000 mark.</p>
<p><strong>Iraq</strong></p>
<p>Violence will subside after the elections and after US strikes in Syria wipe out Baath terror bases used to launch incursions into Iraq.&nbsp; By year's end, US forces in Iraq will drop to 80,000.</p>
<p><strong>UBL</strong></p>
<p>He will be caught, but not by the US.&nbsp; Saudi Arabia will capture him and deal with him in the way only they can.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Sports</strong></p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>No one wins the Stanley Cup.&nbsp; Eight NHL franchises fold in June, prompting the players union to get a clue.&nbsp; The owners and players reach a settlement in August, camps open in September, and the hockey world has something to watch on October 8.</p>
<p>St. Louis Cardinals win the World Series over the New York Yankees 4-2.&nbsp; Albert Pujols named MVP of the season and the series.</p>
<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>
<p>Jacko goes to jail, just as I predicted last year, for a lesser offense.&nbsp; Mel Gibson and Michael Crichton team up to make State of Fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>News</strong></p>
<p>Environmentalists, sensing loss of popular support for the junk science they need, become increasingly terroristic, targeting the middle class in major urban areas.&nbsp; Terrorist acts will include:&nbsp; releasing zoo animals en masse, destroying SUV and vans in mall parking lots, and blocking relief efforts at natural disasters.&nbsp; </p>
