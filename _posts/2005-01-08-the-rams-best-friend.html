<p>This week, former NFL star with the Los Angeles Rams, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/SnowJa00.htm">Jack Snow</a>, father<br />
of San Francisco Giants first baseman J. T. Snow, called into a sports<br />
radio show on station <a href="http://www.kfns.com/">KFNS-590 AM</a>. Snow hosts a weekly show on the same station.&nbsp; Snow read the riot act to<br />
muckraker Kevin Slaten over Slaten's belittling of the St. Louis Rams.</p>
<p>While the Rams have done much to deserve criticism this season, Snow was right in two ways.</p>
<p>First, Snow rightly holds that, however the Rams made it, they made<br />
it.&nbsp; They're in the playoffs with better-than-even chances of<br />
defeating the Seattle Seahawks and advancing to round two.&nbsp; This<br />
team had numerous opportunities to pack it in this season, but they<br />
didn't.&nbsp; Mike Martz seems to have figured out that rookie running<br />
back Steven Jackson is the real deal, that Marshall Faulk just isn't<br />
the everyday player he was two years ago, and that the Rams can still<br />
execute the long, wild passing game made famous in 1999-2001.</p>
<p>Second, he is so right to defend his team.&nbsp; Snow has been a Ram<br />
since graduating from Notre Dame.&nbsp; He is one of the franchise's<br />
all-time great wide receivers with 340 catches for 6,012 yards and 45<br />
touchdowns.&nbsp; That's an average of almost 18 yards per catch.&nbsp;<br />
We need men like Snow who defend their teams.&nbsp; Snow may be<br />
retired, but he's as much a Ram today as he was in 1971.&nbsp; He<br />
exemplifies the football mentality that Brother Mike Barber instilled<br />
in me at St. Mary's High School.&nbsp; "This is football," he'd scream<br />
as we chased bouncing balls on the brick and glass field on Grand<br />
Avenue in South St. Louis.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jack Snow <i>is</i> football.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/othersports/story/DE663CC1122A0F1686256F830015FA6C?OpenDocument&amp;Headline=Sparks+fly+as+Snow,+Slaten+have+it+out">Kevin Slaten</a> should thank God there are<br />
still men who stand for things.&nbsp; While a football team may seems<br />
like a frivilous thing to stand for, most men these stand for far less<br />
and put up with a lot more.</p>
