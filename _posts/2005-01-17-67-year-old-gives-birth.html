<p>Chances are, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=1503&amp;u=/afp/20050116/ts_afp/afplifestyleromaniahealthmother_050116165314&amp;printer=1">the child who lived will have only scant memories of her mother</a>.&nbsp; How much time and energy does a woman nearly 70 have for a baby?&nbsp; I am only 41 with five kids--I don't want more.&nbsp; I see men in their mid-fifties with pre-schoolers and can read the exhaustion, the uncertainty on their faces.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think it's wonderful that modern science allows people who want children to have them.&nbsp; The drawback to that is people who shouldn't want children--like the elderly--having them.&nbsp; </p>
