<p><a href="http://www.jquinton.com/archives/002356.html">Backcountry Conservative</a> has a worth-reading piece on Armstrong Williams' brother, Kent, who took his seat in the South Carolina Senate last week.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Armstrong says his brother is a good conservative who could not hope to win running as a Republican in that district.&nbsp; Good for Kent and for the people of his district.&nbsp; Party affiliation isn't as important as core beliefs, and Kent Williams's core seems as solid as a rock. </p>
