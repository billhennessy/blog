<p>Suppose you have three sets of data:&nbsp; Customers, Orders, Products.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You want to present three dropdownlists--one for each set of data.&nbsp; When I select a Customer from list A, list is rebuilt with Orders for that customer, the first order is selected, and list C is updated with the Products for that order, the first Product selected.</p>
<p>Using ASP.NET postbacks is pretty straightforward, but it's also pretty ugly.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/MasterDetailDDL.asp?select=1016022&amp;forumid=14297&amp;df=100&amp;msg=1016022">Al Alberto </a>got us most of the way to a solution with this article on CodeProject.&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/forums/927/ShowPost.aspx">I've taken his work and extended to achieve the solution descibed above</a>.&nbsp; </p>
