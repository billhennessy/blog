<p>The hosting provider I have used since May of last year was unabled to provide even minimal levels of service over the past month.&nbsp; As a result, the owner of that company decided to end its hosting business.&nbsp; Coincidentally, I saw his notice of termination while I was e-mailing him to let him know that I'd given up on his company's ability to provide web hosting service.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Last night and tonight, I moved four large applications from the old provider to the new one, WebHost4Life.com.&nbsp; The new provider comes with strong recommendations.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people are tired of the constant slow performance and frequent downtime of this site.&nbsp; I am sorry.&nbsp; It has been very difficult three months for me as I have tried to develop websites and manage customers on servers that performed like 486s in de-turbo mode.</p>
<p>Things should be much better here on out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll have much more time to blog . . . </p>
