<p>My mom worked evenings at St. Mary's Hospital starting when I was in fourth grade.&nbsp; My dad went to be about 8:30 or 9:00 every evening, so, with no supervision, I started watching "The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" before my time.&nbsp; I was addicted.</p>
<p>Johnny Carson was a giant of Americana from the 1960s through 1992.&nbsp; He dominated the late night airwaves in a way no one else ever will.&nbsp; Landing a spot on Tonight was the pinnacle of making it in show business.</p>
<p>Johnny kept is politics well conceled.&nbsp; His jabs at the political leaders of his day were polite, even by the standards of the day.&nbsp; For awhile, my life's ambition was to replace him.&nbsp; I'm not alone. </p>
<p><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050123/D87PV6F81.html">Johnny Carson died today</a>.&nbsp; He changed the way I view the world, the way I view myself, and my bedtime.&nbsp; I have missed him for 14+ years.&nbsp; If you're old enough to have been touched by Johnny, you might <a href="http://www.johnnycarson.com/carson/index.jsp">enjoy the official site</a>. </p>
