<p>My old hosting provider should have never gotten into the business.&nbsp; Over the past two weeks, I've been moving all of my sites to <a href="http://www.WebHost4Life.com/default.asp?refid=whennessy">WebHost4Life.com</a>.&nbsp; I just had my first need for technical support, and my problem was resolved in just 23 minutes.&nbsp; The the provider took weeks to respond, if he responded at all.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.WebHost4Life.com/default.asp?refid=whennessy">WebHost4Life.com</a> if you need excellent ASP.NET hosting at the best prices in the world. </p>
