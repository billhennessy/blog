<p>I watched TVLand's tribute to Johnny Carson tonight.&nbsp; Following that was an old episode of All in the Family.&nbsp; Archie wanted to watch football highlights, but Meathead wanted to watch a special with Jack Lemon about polution.&nbsp; Then Little Girl came home from the grocery store with organic food--depriving Archie of his crunchy cereal with the animal cutouts on the box.&nbsp; The conversation moved to argument about&nbsp; a) the environment, b) race relations, c) drinking water, d) the war in Vietnam.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Remarkable.&nbsp; The program that was dated only a few years ago has become as timely as tomorrow's Dan Rather broadcast--with the obvious exception that All in the Family is based on truth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When people march and cry, wring their hands over war, pollution, and other pending disasters of the day, they would do well to pop in an episode of a sitcom from 1971.&nbsp; They'll realize that people of their ilk have expected the world to end for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, they'll eventually be right.&nbsp; </p>
