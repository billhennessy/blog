<p><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050129/D87TESCG0.html">Forty-eight hours from now</a>, America and our allies will have brought democratic elections to a second former dictatorship in less than one year. While the media elite, acadmic snobs, and run of the mill liberal whiners want to pass this election off as a hoax, the historical significance cannot b overstated:&nbsp; the liberations of Aghanistand and Iraq begin the 21st century's march of freedom. </p>
<p>Think back to the turn of the last century.&nbsp; Various ideas of slavery began taking root.&nbsp; Empires spread and conjoined like bacteria merging to beome dangers to more complex species.&nbsp; Ten years in, Europe moved quickly toward war as the Kaisar sued for Living Room.&nbsp; To the east of Germany, a particularly odious brand of despotism captured the imagination of Vladimir Lenin.&nbsp; He used the first world war as a springboard to enslaving half of Europe as fascism spread through Germany, Spain, and Italy betwee the wars.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By 1939, all the world was at war, save for Switzerland and a few idiots in American universities who believed in pacificism the way the ancient mariner believed in the power of the albatross.&nbsp; Half a million Americans died fighting to liberate Europe and the Pacific Rim--the countries who now peer down their noses at our "belligerence."&nbsp; These are modern incarnations of the people who had no personal gripe with Hitler--nor Ho Chi Minh. They have no gripe with terror nor tyranny nor torture nor rape.&nbsp; Would these people, who supported Saddam's regime by vilifying George Bush, convict Johnny Johnson?&nbsp; Johnny Johnson lured a little girl to an abandoned glass factory where he raped her before killing her with a brick to the head.&nbsp; What did Johnson do to humanity that Saddam didn't?&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in forty-eight hours, Providence breaths into the Middle East the wind of self-determination, for both a nation and her individual citizens.&nbsp; Already those citizens exercise their freedom, some in pursuit of happiness, others in the pursuit of mayhem and murder.&nbsp; In the end, good will prevail.&nbsp; The murders will die by the sword they introduced, even as Zarqawi's men fall to Iraqi authority by the day.&nbsp; Soon the Iraqis will have elected their own legislature, giving them the same right as Americans to complain about the quality of governance they themselves chose.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ah, freedom . . . republic . . . democracy!&nbsp; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Lord, I forgot the piece that inspired <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/wfb200501281343.asp">this one--from my hero, William F Buckley</a></p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I just took another whirl around the DNC/Lefty sites.&nbsp; I wonder if there were this many supposedly "good" people cheering against us with such bravado two days before our first election?&nbsp; I hope the new Iraq remembers who its friends were.&nbsp; </p>
