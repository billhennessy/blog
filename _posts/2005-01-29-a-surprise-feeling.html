<p>I just saw the tape of Condoleezza Rice's swearing-in as Secretary of State.&nbsp; Behind her stood her mother and father. </p>
<p>Rice came into the world during segregation in a&nbsp;segregated&nbsp;Alabama.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Madelaine Albright, who discovered she&nbsp;was Jewish when a Jew in the cabinet migh help&nbsp;her president, Secretary Rice has known her life that she's black.&nbsp; In Alabama as a girl,&nbsp;society didn't let you forget.</p>
<p>Ms. Rice follows another African-American in the highest cabinet post&nbsp;of the most powerful country in the world.&nbsp; Think about that for a moment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, think about this.&nbsp; When a&nbsp;Democrat woman&nbsp;accomplishes so much as passing a&nbsp;kidney stone, the media go berserk with&nbsp;stories about women doing great things.&nbsp; When a Jesse Jackson manages&nbsp;to speak in rhyme nonstop for 20 minutes,&nbsp;the&nbsp;MSM hail him as&nbsp;&nbsp;the greatest genius of all time who's overcome everything to achieve . . . whatever it is he's achieved.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Under a Republican president, two consecutive African-Americans, one a woman, succeed to the office of Secretary of State, and the media can only mention that Barbara Boxer hates one of them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sorry, folks, but the&nbsp;double standard&nbsp;among the elite in this country is sickening.&nbsp; I feel like an&nbsp;American Indian woman in 1862.&nbsp; </p>
