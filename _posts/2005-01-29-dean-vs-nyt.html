<p>I get blasted for my occasional (okay, daily) venture into screaming at people.&nbsp; But the usually mellow <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1106982199.shtml">Dean Esmay has had it with the New York Times,</a> and it's a beautiful thing to read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dean stopped reading too soon.&nbsp; Here is the entire list of NYT's "complete" coverage of Iraq.&nbsp; Complete my Irish-white rear-end.&nbsp; Negative stories are in bold.&nbsp;(12 of 17)</p>
