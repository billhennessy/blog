<p><a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2005/1/24/25546/0124">MyDD blog has a very good analysis of his party's relationship </a>to labor vis a vis other liberal causes.&nbsp; I like to think of labor unions as applied liberalism, and academic liberalism (causes) as theoretical or pure liberalism.&nbsp; Having grown up in very pro-labor neighborhood of South St. Louis, I have&nbsp; soft spot for guys like this.&nbsp; </p>
