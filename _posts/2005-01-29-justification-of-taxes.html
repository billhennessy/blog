<p><a href="http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2005/01/how_not_to_comp_1.html">Elizabeth Anderson, over at Left2Right</a>, is on installment number 3 of her Ode to Taxes and the State.&nbsp; She's subtle, but she's not a very gifted thinker.&nbsp; I was going to add this brief comment to the blog, but they won't let me.&nbsp; So, I'll post this here.&nbsp; I plan to write a point-by-point attack on her specious claims tomorrow.</p>
<p>My commet to Elizabeth:</p>
<p><em>Glad to see you're satisfied with your "proofs."&nbsp; Your arguments are nothing more than mere sentiment and fail to even consider, much less overcome, moral arguments for property rights.&nbsp; Nor do you bother, so far as I can tell, to establish that governments have rights superior to the governed.&nbsp; I see no way one entity can forcibly seize the property of another without either self-evident (i.e., no one bothers to argue about it) moral authority or overwhelming phsyical authority.</em></p>
<p><em>Frankly, your arguments are extremely similar to the Third Reich's justifications for seizing the homes of Jews.&nbsp; Social insurance.&nbsp; But, in your sentiment, the Nazis had every right to do so:&nbsp; they were freely elected by the people, they faced extraordinary social decay from the penalties of WWI, and they were, after all, the government.<br /></em></p>
