<p>The headline of Iraq's first free elections.&nbsp; Better than expected.&nbsp; Less violence than feared.&nbsp; Higher turnout than anticipated--over 60% nationwide.</p>
<p>Ah, lovers of freedom and self-determination, savor the moment.&nbsp; When the statues of Saddam fell, the world laughed.&nbsp; But when the people voted today, the gods smiled.&nbsp; This, like our own election in 1788, the election today is the first true exercise of freedom in Iraq.</p>
<p>Sure, John Kerry can only decry the lack of "international community" participation.&nbsp; John, the Coalition of the Willing IS the international community.&nbsp; We have supplanted the United Nations, a corrupt and irrelevant Cold War relic.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am thrilled.&nbsp; There's not much more to say. Once I saw the chubby Iraqi men dancing and singing to a tambourine at Detroit polling place, I knew the result of the election:&nbsp; freedom won.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Others are saying things worth reading, though.&nbsp; Try <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1107101422.shtml">Dean Esmay</a>, <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6044">Steven Taylor</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6045">Steven Taylor</a>, Outside the Beltway has <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9033">this </a>and <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9032">this</a>, and, of course, if you want to laugh at life's losers on DemocraticUnderground check out <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=102x1196727#1196736">this miserable banner of poor sportsmanship</a>, which I've summarized <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/01/30/965.aspx">here</a>.&nbsp; Perhaps<a href="http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001496.php"> this photo on InDC </a>says it all.&nbsp; <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001370.htm">Michelle Malkin </a>has a good round up of women voting in Iraq.&nbsp; </p>
