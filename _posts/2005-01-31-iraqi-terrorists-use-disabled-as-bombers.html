<blockquote>
<p><span>Terrorists used a disabled child as a suicide bomber on election day, Iraqi interior minister Falah al-Naqib said today.</p>
<p>In all, 44 people were killed in a total of 38 bomb attacks on polling stations. Police at the scene of one the Baghdad blasts said the bomber appeared to have Down's syndrome.</p>
<p>Mr Al-Naqib praised an Iraqi citizen who was killed while preventing one suicide bomber from reaching a crowd of people outside a polling station. </p>

<p>Remember, folks, the people who strapped the bomb to a mentally retarded child are considered noble freedom fighters by the New York Times, Washington Post, United Nations, and Howard Dean.&nbsp; </p>
