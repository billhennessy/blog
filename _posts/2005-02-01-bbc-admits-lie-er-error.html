<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_4220000/newsid_4222300/4222353.stm">The BBC admits </a>that it was wrong when it claimed coalition forces had killed more Iraqi civilians than had all other factors combined in the history of the country.&nbsp; Well, they didn't claim that, exactly, but if the BBC can irresponsibly hyperbolize facts in order to promoted its twisted, anti-Western, pro-terrorist viewpoints, why can't we?&nbsp; </p>
