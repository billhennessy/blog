  content: 'The holdout juror in effect forced the other jurors to concede that Churchill
    soiled his own reputation and deserved nothing more than nominal damages. The
    only alternative to making this concession was to have a hung jury. The $1 monetary
    award reflects this compromise in favor of CU''s findings of research misconduct
    against Churchill.

<p>Calling for Mr. Churchill's death, while consistent with his view of how one should treat those with whom he disagrees, would be too easy.&nbsp; Let's keep this brainless, hate-spreading, son-of-a-bitch around&nbsp;awhile.&nbsp; I like kicking stupid bastards around, and Ward Churchill is my top candidate for Stupid Bastard of the 21st Century.&nbsp; That young people pay money to listen to his ignorance uttered demonstrates that, perhaps, American society is as troubled as he wishes it were.</p>
<p>Let's read a little of what Mr. Churchill wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most that can honestly be said of those involved on September 11 is that they finally responded in kind to some of what this country has dispensed to their people as a matter of course.</p>
<p>That they waited so long to do so is, notwithstanding the 1993 action at the WTC, more than anything a testament to their patience and restraint.</p>
<p>They did not license themselves to "target innocent civilians."</p>
<p>There is simply no argument to be made that the Pentagon personnel killed on September 11 fill that bill. The building and those inside comprised military targets, pure and simple. As to those in the World Trade Center . . .</p>
<p>Well, really. Let's get a grip here, shall we? True enough, they were civilians of a sort. But innocent? Gimme a break. They formed a technocratic corps at the very heart of America's global financial empire  the "mighty engine of profit" to which the military dimension of U.S. policy has always been enslaved  and they did so both willingly and knowingly. Recourse to "ignorance"  a derivative, after all, of the word "ignore"  counts as less than an excuse among this relatively well-educated elite. To the extent that any of them were unaware of the costs and consequences to others of what they were involved in  and in many cases excelling at  it was because of their absolute refusal to see. More likely, it was because they were too busy braying, incessantly and self-importantly, into their cell phones, arranging power lunches and stock transactions, each of which translated, conveniently out of sight, mind and smelling distance, into the starved and rotting flesh of infants. If there was a better, more effective, or in fact any other way of visiting some penalty befitting their participation upon the little Eichmanns inhabiting the sterile sanctuary of the twin towers, I'd really be interested in hearing about it.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have it, in complete context and without my editorial interruptions.&nbsp; He cheers the terrorists and spits on the graves of the dead.&nbsp; </p>
<p>More frightening are his defenders.&nbsp; Like the Brown Shirts, they defend his "interesting" perspective and the fact that he "makes people think."&nbsp; No, boys and girls of academia, he doesn't make people think:&nbsp; he makes people respond the way an angry dog responds when poked with a stick.&nbsp; Ward Churchill is scum with a microphone, stinking up American society with thoughtless, moronic words strung together into sentences designed to inspire hate and encourage terrorism. </p>
<p>Mr. Churchill is Joseph Goebbels without the power or the command of language.&nbsp; His writing is weak, even for a college professor.&nbsp; His mind is weaker.&nbsp; His spine, practically nonexistent.&nbsp; </p>
