<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=548&amp;u=/ap/20050201/ap_on_el_ge/democrats_chair_14&amp;printer=1">With Martin Frost out of the running for DNC Chairman</a>, it looks more and more like Howard Dean, the biggest name among the three remaining contenders, will get the nod.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then again, we were all saying the same thing about Dean and the DNC nomination about this time last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many Republicans cant wait for Dr. Dean to take his seat at the head of the opposition table, I am a little cautious.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nothing rational about my concerns:<span>&nbsp; </span>just experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cant tell you the number of times Ive assured myself the Cardinals would win the World Series, the Blues the Stanley Cup, the Rams the Super Bowl because Team X upset Team Y in the other series.<span>&nbsp; </span>You should have seen the smile on my face when the New England Patriots snuck past the Oakland Raiders for the AFC Championship in 2002.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or the Red Sox beating the Yankees in the ALCS last season.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or the Blues drawing the Canucks in the first round of the playoffs two years ago.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time, I felt the pushover won.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each time, the pushover pushed over my team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dean might just destroy the DNC.<span>&nbsp; </span>But he might also revive it.<span>&nbsp; </span>By drawing together the various factions of the left, he could prove something of a Ronald Reagan to the Democrats.<span>&nbsp; </span>Remember, the only thing Reagan had to offer in 1976 and 1980 was the hard right as it was called.<span>&nbsp; </span>Goldwater Republicans.<span>&nbsp; </span>What the Democrats failed to realize when they licked their chops over Reagans candidacy was the fact that his base wasnt the straw that would break the elephants back, but the missing piece in the GOPs ascendancy to majority party status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Dean can corral the far left while maintaining the labor movement, the civil rights industry, and Hispanics, he could position the Democrat party for a major resurgence in 2008.</p>
<p>While Im sure Dr. Dean will give me plenty to blog about, Ill wait until 2006 off-year elections to decide if hes something to </p>
<p>&nbsp;cheer about.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6132"> Steven Taylor tells us that another </a>candidate has dropped, making Dean's coronation more likely</strong></p>
<p>Poliblogger had this to say about the Reuters story</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the procuders of talk show and bloggers all cheered. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Again, I may be a pessimist, but somehow this seems too easy--like when we marched into Baghdad and declared the end of major combat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's hope Dean is as nutty a chairman as he is a candidate.&nbsp; If you forgot, click <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/category/1002.aspx">here for my Dean Blogs</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; The other Dean (Esmay) has <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1107562593.shtml">jumped in with this</a></p>
