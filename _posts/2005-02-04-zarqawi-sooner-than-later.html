<p>Yes, this is too easy with the headlines that US and Iraqi troops have just missed him two or three times in the past two weeks.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I have a soft stop for gut things, and George Bush is on a roll.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, Condi and Gonzalez have been confirmed.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The stock market continues to improve.</li>
<li>The State of the Union address was the best he's given so far.</li>
<li>The Iraqi elections were an overwhelming success.</li>
<li>Afghanistan is a democracy.</li>
<li>Social Security reform seems probable as the Democrat demogoguery has eased since last night.</li>
<li>Saddam's trial will begin soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>You put all of these things together and they add up to a winning streak for the POTUS.&nbsp; Zarqawi will fall soon.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bin Laden, though, seems to be another story.&nbsp; I suspect he is safe so long as he stays in Pakistan.&nbsp; </p>
