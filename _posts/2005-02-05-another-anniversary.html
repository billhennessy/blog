<p>Two years ago this coming Tuesday, I met a girl for a drink at the Fox and Hounds at Cheshire Inn in St. Louis.&nbsp; She'd contacted me through Match.com about two weeks earlier.&nbsp; I watched her cross Clayton Road.&nbsp; She moved like a dream--beautiful, graceful, certain.&nbsp; We talked for over 3 hours.&nbsp; I sang all the way home--40 minutes.&nbsp; I sang Sinatra and Lenny Kravitz.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We went out on Valentine's Day, one week later.&nbsp; On that, most pressure-packed of date nights for men, Angela put me so at ease.&nbsp; We had a wonderful, romantic dinner, then bar hopped&nbsp; in Soulard and Downtown.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By April, 2003, I was completely head over heels.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, we're married, and I never dreamed I could be so happy because of another person.&nbsp; But Angela seems to be a personal messenger sent by God to let me know that the universe can produce wonderful, wonderful things.</p></p>
