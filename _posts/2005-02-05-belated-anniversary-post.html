<p>Before I ever heard the term blogging, I published three 500-750 word columns a week on my old website.&nbsp; That started in 1999.&nbsp; Work and other things became too demanding, so I let it lapse in 2001.&nbsp; This blog began about two years ago, but I got serious on December 15, 2003.&nbsp; I'll mark that as my anniversary.&nbsp; It was the Monday after Saddam fell (crawled) into US custody.</p>
<p>Two gentlemen have been too kind to me in the past year.&nbsp; I must tip my cap to <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/">Steven Taylor </a>and <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/">Dean Esmay</a>.&nbsp; Dozens of others have been kind enough to comment, e-mail, or link.&nbsp; Thanks to you, too.</p>
<p>Finally, a couple of years ago, before I met the most wonderful woman in the world, I would have been out shootin' it on a Friday night, especially Mardi Gras weekend.&nbsp; But here I sit at my Compaq Evo 800 blogging.&nbsp; So I have to thank my wife, the tree-hugging, clog-wearing, self-described bleeding-heart liberal.&nbsp; I know I'm too harsh sometimes--she never is.&nbsp; I have no doubt that if all "liberals" were like my bride, liberalism would achieve world hegemony.&nbsp; But it takes only one jerk to screw it all up, so we need us righties to keep the bad guys at bay. </p>
<p>Anyway, thank you, blogosphere.&nbsp; It's been a very good year. </p>
<p>Cordially,<br />Bill Hennessy</p>
