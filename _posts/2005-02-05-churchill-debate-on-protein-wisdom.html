<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Steven Taylor favors us with an <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6137">extensive examination of the Churchill debate </a>with links to pertinent blogs and articles.&nbsp; I understand his points about the protections Churchill has built up over time:&nbsp; tenure, government employee, etc.&nbsp; As an originalist, I don't buy the government employee protection because I don't buy the conduit of the 14th Amendment argument.&nbsp; Further, firing him is not the same as incarcerating him.&nbsp; The state of Colorado is under no Constitutional or moral obligation to continue the employment of any person it deems detrimental to the state's welfare.&nbsp; Under present interpretations of the 14th Amendment, Colorado may not be able to jail him--thank God for that--but they have no obligation to retain him. </p>
<p>Some lefty school somewhere will hire this imbicile should U of C axe him.&nbsp; His livlihood does not depend on his current job.&nbsp;And his book is ranked 101 on Amazon's bestseller list, so he has both a soapbox and a source of income.</p>
<p>If I were a regent, I'd vote for his termination. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.celluloid-wisdom.com/pw/index.php?/weblog/entry/17843">This a great discussion</a>.&nbsp;Here I'll give you little piece of an exchange with a girl named <a href="http://bitsofrebekah.blogspot.com/2005/02/craving.html">Rebekah whose latest blog entry is, well, thought provoking.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><a></a></p>
<p>Im frustrated with those who have read an article or two and think that qualifies them to make articulate or accurate judgements of the situation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>CraigC: Churchill didnt say those working at the World Trade Center deserved to die. Nor did he refer, as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/02/02/speaker.protest.ap/index.html"><font>CNN claims</font></a>, to all white collar workers. <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/EthnicStudies/press_releases/ward_churchill_013105.html"><font>Churchills official statement</font></a> concerns the technocrats of empire, a group he later describes as the CIA office...situated in the World Trade Center and the command and control infrastructure there.&nbsp; His statement is that the placement of government workers in a civilian facility makes that facility a legitimate military target for offensive action by those against whom he believes the United States has militarily transgressed. </p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with this statement or with his comments in general, please dont twist his statements. </p>
<p>Secondly, Churchill has not done anything deserving of termination of his employment.&nbsp; He made comments that, due to the nature of the subject matter, invariably offended people.&nbsp; <em>Any</em> criticism of the United States following the 9/11 attacks is bound to offend people. </p>
<p>The man may be stupid, pompous and greedy for attention.&nbsp; His argument may be faulty and inconsiderate.&nbsp; Still, his comments are not grounds for dismissal.&nbsp; Churchill may be abrasive, but that alone is not reason to fire him. </p>

<p>Rebekah, </p>
<p>Obviously, youve read Mr. Churchills press release.&nbsp; Had you read the original essay, youd realize that the press release amounts to spin.&nbsp; Its a pack of lies.&nbsp; He denies writing what he wrote and allowed to be published. </p>
<p>In his essay, Churchill wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p>If there was a better, more effective, or in fact any other way of visiting some penalty befitting their participation upon the little Eichmanns inhabiting the sterile sanctuary of the twin towers, Id really be interested in hearing about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his press release he claims </p>
<blockquote><p>I mourn the victims of the September 11 attacks</p></blockquote>
<p>Rational humans cannot square those two quotes with each other. </p>
<p>Theres plenty more. </p>
<p>Mr. Churchill believes childish things.&nbsp; But he is, at heart, a heartless capitalist.&nbsp; He intended his inflammatory essay to spur sales of his book--which aint real high on the Amazon chart.&nbsp; He calculated a balance between outrageousness and dollars.&nbsp; Had he calculated that the only way to achieve his sales goal was to announce that he would donate $1 from each book sold to Al Qaeda for training the next wave of suicide pilots, he would have done so. </p>
<p>And, yes, he should be fired.&nbsp; He brought discredit upon his employer for his own personal financial gain.&nbsp; That gets people fired every day.&nbsp; He is no different than the convicted leaders of Enron and Adelphia.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Jeff Goldstein picked up my challenge to reconcile Churchill's two, seemingly contradictory statements.&nbsp; Here's the product of his effort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just to play devils advocate, I can square those two quotes:&nbsp; I mourn the victims of the September 11 attacks who were turned into little Eichmanns by a system that promotes domestic greed and apathy at the expense of oppressed peoples the world over. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagreed that he'd created a <em>rational</em> squaring of the two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff, </p>
<p>Just pick a point, you havent squared the two statements at all--youve woven the adjectives. In fact, youve dealt exclusively with the part of the sentence that can be thrown away without losing Churchills meaning: </p>
<blockquote><p>If there was a better, more effective, or in fact any other way of visiting some penalty . . . Id really be interested in hearing about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The penalty to which this sentence refers is death, in many cases by fire or suffocation.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Jeff still thinks he's reached a logical melding of Churchill's two points:&nbsp; a) I mourn those who died in the Twin Towers and the airplanes with b) I know of no more proper punishment for those who died in the Twin Towers and airplanes than to have been murdered as they were.</p>
<p>Am I wrong here, or is Jeff just playing semantics to defend the professor?</p>
