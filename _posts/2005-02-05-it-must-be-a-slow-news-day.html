<p>All I can think about is Howard Dean!&nbsp; Poliblogger and <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1107562593.shtml">Dean Esmay </a>are talking about him, too. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6134">Steven Taylor noticed my paranoia about Dean</a>.&nbsp; Hey, I admit there's no <em>logical</em> reason to conclude that Dean will revitalize the Democrat party.&nbsp; This blog frivilously documented Dr. Dean's ridiculous run for the White House in 2003 (the wrong year).&nbsp; I still marvel at the seriousness with which the major media treated Dean.&nbsp; When his campaign went into permanent hibernation mode, some people supposedly close to the former governor admitted that Dean himself never thought his campaign would be taken seriously.&nbsp; A psychologist might make more of his implosion. </p>
<p>If Dean indeed sabotaged (subconsciously or otherwise) his own campaign last year, the prospects for the DNC would seem bleak.&nbsp; Likely, Dean would quit the post after the 2006 elections, either to make way for a professional, or to run for the White House against Hillary and Kerry.&nbsp; How much damage can he do in two years? </p>
<p>Plenty.</p>
<p>The people who reluctantly voted for Bush over Kerry, based on polling data, are best described as serious people.&nbsp; They might like a good joke, and I'm sure they have their fun sides.&nbsp; Still, they, like most grown ups, take important matters seriously.&nbsp; They may have doubts about the Iraqi war, but they understand then when the USA is in a shooting match, you pass the ammo and keep your head down.&nbsp; These adults saw something of the college president candidate in Kerry--and student council candidates for Congress.&nbsp; George Bush looked voters in the eye and told them&nbsp;things they didn't want to hear.&nbsp; Serious men do such things.&nbsp; Kerry, on the other hand, looked around the room and said things&nbsp;no one understood.&nbsp; Like Al Gore, he seemed more interested in demonstrating how bloody smart he is rather than what he would do with a four year license to run the Executive branch.</p>
<p>Of all the things Howard Dean is not, serious tops the list.&nbsp; (If Howard Dean is serious about the things he says, the psychologists must be as eager to get him on the couch as <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/editorial/the_editors200502020729.asp">National Review is to get him into the DNC chair</a>.)&nbsp; More importantly, the grown ups in America see him as unserious.&nbsp; Like Bill Clinton, he might be a fun president at a frivilous time--like the 1990s, when the <a href="http://bullwinkle.toonzone.net/boris.htm">Boris Badenovs </a>of the world were still trying to figure out what to do without <a href="http://bullwinkle.toonzone.net/fearlessleader.htm">Fearless Leader</a>.&nbsp; With a new industry maturing, a tech bubble, and loose accounting rules for corporations, the president's primary job is entertainment.</p>
<p>In 2000, with an election looming, the grown ups got together and took their money away from irresponsible geeks with bad ideas.&nbsp; Likewise, political grown ups took the White House away from a president who seemed a little too much like the internet millionaires--young, extravagent, wild, loose, fun, charming, glib . . . empty.&nbsp; In George Bush, we find a president who makes serious adults comfortable.&nbsp; In Howard Dearn, we find a man who makes little girls giggle.</p>
<p>As I said, there is no logical reason to pick the DNC to win in 2006 or 2008 with Dean at its helm.&nbsp; As I also said, though, in 2002 there was no logical argument for the Patriots beating the Rams.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since everybody's talking about Dean, might as well join <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9115">The Beltway Traffic Jam</a></p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://themoderatevoice.powerblogs.com/posts/1107432402.shtml">Joe Gandelman </a>has some observations that well worth the read.</p>
