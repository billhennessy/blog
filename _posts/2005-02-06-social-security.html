<h4><a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/forums/25/ShowForum.aspx">Discuss Social Security Reform in the official BillHennessy.com forum</a></h4>
<p>I just learned how much money I'm flushing down the toilet by participating the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/socialsecurity/">Social Security scam</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can expect to pay $383,219 in Social Security taxes over your<br />
working life for retirement and survivors benefits. For those taxes,<br />
you can expect to receive $2,525 a month in Social Security retirement<br />
benefits. Your rate of return under today's Social Security is 0.03%. </p>
<p>However,<br />
if you had been able to invest all of your Social Security taxes in a<br />
Personal Retirement Account (PRA), you would have had a total of<br />
$1,246,148 when you retired. Your monthly benefits would have been<br />
$10,151. You lost $7,626 a month. </p>
