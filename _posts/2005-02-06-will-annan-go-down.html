<p>Looks like <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050206/D8832L180.html">Paul Volcker's investigation </a>of the UN Oil-for-Terrorism scam is closing in on Kofi Annan.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigators probing alleged corruption at the United Nations oil-for-food program are scrutinizing thousands of pages of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's documents, including e-mail and phone records, to determine whether he exerted influence in securing a contract for a Swiss company that employed his son.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, Volcker's team had cleared the elder Annan of wrong-doing in connection with the scam which diverted billlions of dollars intended to releive the suffering of poor Iraqis into the pockets of Saddam Hussein and his sons.&nbsp; "There were things that came along that threw us back," Volcker said in an AP interview, explaining why Annan is now in the center of his team's spotlight. </p>
<p>Who else will have a popcorn, beer, and a big grin watching Kofi Annan's perp walk?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
