<p>of the DNC Chair.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>(CNN) -- Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean appears to have virtually locked up the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, after his last major challenger dropped out of the race and endorsed him Friday night.</b></p>
<p>Veteran party activist Donnie Fowler, who had been positioning himself as the alternative candidate to Dean, said it was "clear" Dean had the votes to become the new chairman when DNC members vote next week.</p>
