<p>Just because my company works closely&nbsp;with Anheuser-Busch&nbsp;and just because I drink Bud Light and Mich Ultra and just because I grew up in St. Louis and started taking brewery tours when in still in high school--they really didn't card too heavily in the hospitality room back then--doesn't mean I'm not objective.</p>
<p>I'm not objective because&nbsp;of my&nbsp;soft spot&nbsp; for the military, in part because I served in the Navy for 10 years, and in part because all of my male relatives in my parents' generation fought in World War II, Korea, or both.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch's simple "Thank You" commercial forced me out of the family room.&nbsp; I don't like the kids to see me cry.&nbsp; They wouldn't understand. </p>
<p>In 1986, after a particularly arduous strategic deterrent patrol in the far north Atlantic, at the airport in Glasgow, Scotland, we prepared to fly home to Charleston.&nbsp; Our&nbsp;captain, a man&nbsp; never too comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking in public, stood on a chair in the terminal and gave a five minute speech about what we'd just been through.&nbsp; At the end of the speech, we, his crew, stood in silence.&nbsp; Some of the chief petty officers, the old tough salts, had tears in their eyes.&nbsp; After 30 seconds of dead quiet, not the crew, but the people in the airport, the civilians, the Brits, the Scots, the Irish, the Europeans,&nbsp;cheered and shouted.&nbsp; Palms slapped me on the back, &nbsp;and I turned to see a wonderful Scottish woman smiling through stereotypical British teeth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A-B's airport salute was the best I've ever seen.&nbsp; It's the way I hope every soldier, Marine, sailor, and airman returns to the USA--surrounded by spontaneous appreciation for dirty job done--however well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thank you, Anheuser-Busch.&nbsp; </p>
<p>BTW, NAG, as Rush calls it, has a website devoted to <a href="http://www.nowfoundation.org/issues/communications/watchout3/superbowl.html">hating Super Bowl commercials</a>, and A-B is their number one target.&nbsp; If the NAG gals hate A-B, it must be a wonderful thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; My favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"All the 'watchers' in my front room agreed that Budweiser should NEVER be purchased by any self-respecting woman." </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, every little thing in life causes feminists pain and misery and anguish.&nbsp; Why don't they just kill themselves?&nbsp; And why the wimpy, grating, limp-wristed, convoluted passive voice?&nbsp; </p>
