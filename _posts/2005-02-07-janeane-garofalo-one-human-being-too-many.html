<p>If there's anyone on this planet whose presence depresses the hell out of me, it's that brainless windbag Janeane Garofalo.&nbsp; Not that I needed more reasons to despise her, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alittlemoretotheright.com/journal/00002120.html">A Little More to the Right </a>found one.&nbsp; I haven't seen this anywhere else, so take a read.&nbsp;Money quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The inked fingers and the position of them, which is gonna be a 'Daily Show' photo already, of them signaling in this manner [Nazi salute], as if they have solidarity with the Iraqis who braved physical threats against their lives to vote as if somehow these inked-fingered Republicans have something to do with that." </p>

<p>A Little More to the Right is an excellent blog if you haven't stumbled across it yet. </p>
