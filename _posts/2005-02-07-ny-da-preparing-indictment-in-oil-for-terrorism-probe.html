<p>According to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,146503,00.html">Fox News</a>, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney has launched a criminal probe into Benon Sevan , the U.N. Oil-for-Food&nbsp; chief who investigators said had "serious conflict of interest" while overseeing the program. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must say this is good news.&nbsp; An indictment by a US grand jury is one of only two&nbsp;ways to get to the bottom of the scam, and the only hope for putting the criminals behind bars.&nbsp; Any internation tribunal would be a show ending cenusre or less.&nbsp; The other way, of course, is to try the bastards in Iraq, right along with Saddam Hussein.&nbsp; </p>
