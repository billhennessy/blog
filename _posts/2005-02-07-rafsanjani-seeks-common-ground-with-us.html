<p>In an interview with <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-02-06-rafsanjani-lead_x.htm">USA Today</a>, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the once and future president of Iran, said the US and Iran have more common ground than differences. Running for a return to the Iranian presidency, Rafsanjani&nbsp;was clearly speaking to the White House through the press.</p>
<p>If he's sincere and he returns to power, this could be a major victory for Bush's foreign policy in the Middle East.&nbsp; Bringing a moderate or liberal government to Iran is not Rafsanjani's goal, for sure, but, like Gorbechev found in the Soviet Union, any reform could spin out of control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rafsanjani's demand that the US unfreeze the billions of Iranian assets that the Carter adminstration locked up in 1979 gives reason to doubt.&nbsp; Yet the rest of the interview gives reason for hope.&nbsp; Perhaps, like Libya, Iran's leaders realize that the United States will soon be relieved of the burden in Iraq and might turn its freedom-loving eye east.&nbsp; The US military is all the incentive wise dictators need to reform.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's hope Iran follows Libya's lead.</p>
