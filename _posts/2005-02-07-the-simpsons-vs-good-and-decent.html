<p>Boy, something evil crawled up the wrong end of The Simpsons' writers and died.&nbsp; You get the feeling that they're pulling for Al Qaeda. The entire post game episode, promoted heavily for two weeks, was a mockery of everything good and decent.&nbsp; Anyone with mild religiosity advocates beating and killing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ah, well.&nbsp; They lost the biggest election of their putrid lives.&nbsp; I guess I should remember them in my prayers tonight.&nbsp; That'll piss 'em off. </p>
