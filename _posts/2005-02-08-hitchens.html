<p>Some people demand admiration, and Christopher Hitchens ranks near the top of that list.&nbsp; Before I agreed with him about anything, back in the days when he seemed closer to Alexander Cockburn than to, well, to me, I would find myself pausing on some talkshow just because he was talking.&nbsp; </p>
<p>His writing is as enjoyable as his conversation--and it's conversation he has on talk shows, not interviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/000730.html">Michael Totten favors us</a>, today, with a piece about an evening with Hitch at DC bar.&nbsp; I envy Totten.&nbsp; Aside from Winston Churchill and Peter O'Toole, I can't think of an Englishman I'd rather spend an evening with.&nbsp; (And O'Toole was born in Ireland.)</p>
