<p>We <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2698562,00.html">learn today </a>that Colorado University cancelled an upcoming Ward Churchill appearance over fear of violence.&nbsp; Remember when conservative speakers were silenced by threats of violence?&nbsp; (William F. Buckley Jr. had a famous episode at Harvard in about 1968.)</p>
<p>Ward Churchill has two choices:&nbsp; resign from CU and go to work for some leftwing think-tank that doesn't care how much he lies on his resume, or move subtlely to the right.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My guess is that he will move to the right.&nbsp; He will not apologize, but he will publish an essay that effectively repudiates the original.&nbsp; We already see this distancing act in his official press release, and in an interview he granted last week with some leftwing e-magazine.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001464.htm">Michelle Malkin now informs that Mr. Churchill </a>has, indeed, begun distancing himself from the Little Eichmann's comment.&nbsp; Gee, I feel like Rush. </p>
