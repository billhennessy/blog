<p>Reading the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20050210/ap_on_re_us/democrats_chair_5">AP story via Yahoo</a>&nbsp;about Howard Dean's pending coronation as chairman of the DNC, my paranoia kicked in again.&nbsp; What if the press turns him into a folk hero--again?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I can see the MSM going berserk for the next two year.&nbsp; Everything the man says, does, and thinks broadcast live throughout the world as it happens.&nbsp; The liberal pundits will defend his frequent bouts of stupidity and insanity as demonstrative of his deep intellect.&nbsp; "You red staters just aren't equipped with the mental prowess to capture his deep and transient meanings," they'll assure us.&nbsp; "But Howard Dean is moving the party in the right direction."</p>
<p>You know what they say about a lie repeated often enough.&nbsp; Well, that's what the MSM does best.&nbsp; Just ask Dan Rather.</p>
