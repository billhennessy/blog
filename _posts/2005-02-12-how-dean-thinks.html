<p>Want to know how Howard Dean thinks?&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I support allotting a certain percentage of seats in these elections for the Sunnis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ponder that&nbsp;a moment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The man who wanted to be chief executive of the modern world's first democratic republic wrote on <a href="http://www.democracyforamerica.com/features/2005/01/10/keep_the_election_on_track.php">January 10, 2005</a>, that he believes Iraqis deserve some sort of managed democracy in which votes are only marginally important.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Instead of letting the people, who can't be trusted in Dean's view, to decide affairs, Dean would have a team of fairness experts decide how to apportion seats in the Iraqi legislature.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Given the chance, Dr. Dean would visit the horrors of a centralized planning agency on America, as well.&nbsp; Miles separate Dean's idea of democracy and self-determination from the common understanding of our founders and the philosophers they embraced.</p>
