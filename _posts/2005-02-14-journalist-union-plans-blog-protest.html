<p>St. Louis, Missouri--The <a href="http://www.ifj.org/default.asp?Issue=NOAM&amp;Language=EN">International Federation of Journalists</a>, a union representing more than half a million journalists world wide, today announced plans to protest Blogs--online journals on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>"Unprofessional armchair writers who call themselves journalists have destroyed numerous careers and the&nbsp;lives of respected members of our organization. It's time we stopped this dangerous trend toward information run amock," says Arnold Amber of the Newspaper Guild of Canada.</p>
<p>In a written statement, union president Chris Warren says, "Dan Rather and Eason Jordan had their lives turned inside out by probing, nosey, busybodies who have no more qualifications to write than a computer and broadband internet access.&nbsp; We don't let just anyone perform brain surgery, do we?&nbsp; Then we must not let just anyone write news stories.&nbsp; The news is far to important to be left to the people."</p>
<p>The protest, originally scheduled for February 14, has been postponed until the union can find a place to protest.&nbsp; "Well, we don't really know where to go," Amber said.&nbsp; "These guerillas don't have a home base, so to speak.&nbsp; We're thinking of holding the protest in Key West, Florida, since the weather's nice and broadband internet access is available, making it a possible haven for so called citizen-journalists."</p>
<p>Bloggers, busy at their day jobs, could not be reached for comment.&nbsp; </p>
