<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001492.htm">Michelle Malkin</a> has&nbsp;a nice roundup of blogs and MSM stories on the UN sex scandal.&nbsp; Thanks much, Michelle, for the plug.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some stories hit me harder than others, and I've been anti-UN for about 20 years.&nbsp; I thought I'd post a few lines that wrote in my 1993 book, <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/forums/1016/PostAttachment.aspx">The Conservative Manifesto:</a></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since there is little evidence to defend the United Nations as anything but a hindrance to the cause of democracy and the advance of American foreign policy, we will withdraw from the United Nations and expel it from our borders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></font></p>
<p>There are some things in that little book what I wish, now, I either hadn't written or had written more evenhandedly.&nbsp; My view of the UN, though, has not changed.&nbsp; If anything, it's hardened.&nbsp; In the twelve years since I penned that quote, the United Nations has only given us on the right more reason to sue for its demise. </p>
