<blockquote>
<p>Google employees gave $207,650 to federal candidates for last year's elections, up from just $250 in 2000 when it was still a start-up.

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I think I've removed all the Google crap from my site.&nbsp; If you notice any remaining, please use the Contact link to tell me about it.</p>
