<p>According to the <a href="http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Newdow has filed a brand-new lawsuit in federal district court against the Pledge of Allegiance!&nbsp; He is also threatening to file suits in all 13 judicial circuits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good heavens.&nbsp; Is it really that big of a deal, Michael?&nbsp; Leave it alone.&nbsp; Don't say "under God" when reciting the pledge.&nbsp; Instruct your children not to say it.&nbsp; But some of us growing weary of hearing what offends you.&nbsp; </p>
