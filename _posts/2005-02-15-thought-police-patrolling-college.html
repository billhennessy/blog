<p><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/5303.html">Le Moyne College </a>has expelled a grad student for writing a paper (which recieved a grade of A) that advocates stricter discipline in schools.&nbsp; According to the dismissal letter, Le Moyne beleives that all students must strictly adhere to the administration's philosophy of education.&nbsp; There is no room at Le Moyne for individual thinking, according to <a href="mailto:leogracc@lemoyne.edu">Cathy Leogrande</a>, who signed the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leogrande wrote, I have grave concerns regarding the mismatch between your personal beliefs regarding teaching and learning and the Le Moyne College program goals.&nbsp; Based on this data, I do not believe that you should continue in the Le Moyne [Master of Science for Teachers] Program. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hereby invite the administration of Le Moyne College in New York to move to Cuba, North Korea, or some other communist dictatorship where the views of authority cannot be challenged.&nbsp; </p>
