<p>Even though I need to fill in some big gaps in time, my<a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/category/1021.aspx"> posts go back to August 2000</a>.&nbsp; The original site I wrote myself in Active Server Pages (classic) and XML.&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, I upgraded it to ASP.NET.&nbsp; Somewhere in between lie several dozen LONG pieces that I can't find, though I know they exist somewhere in various CD-ROMs burnt from dying hard drives.&nbsp; (I hosted my old site on my home desktop/server via Deerfield's DNS2GO over my cable modem.)</p>
<p>In between, I played around with Linux, but it proved way too time-consuming and limited.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyway, I'll leave it up to you:&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/forums/1083/ShowPost.aspx">is Hennessy's View five-years-old? </a></p>
