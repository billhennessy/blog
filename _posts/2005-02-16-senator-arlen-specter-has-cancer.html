<p>Hodgekins Lymphoma, according to <a href="http://www.nbc10.com/news/4205235/detail.html?rss=phi&amp;psp=news">Philly TV station's webite</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I know I typed this before, but, somehow, it didn't get saved:&nbsp; </p>
<div>I've had my disagreements with Senator Specter, but so has the left. Feminists still seeth over his valient defense of Clarence Thomas. </p>
<p>For the most part, when justice or his party really needed him, he's shown up. </p>
<p>I wish him the best.&nbsp; As does <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1108605885.shtml">Dean Esmay</a>. And <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_02_13_corner-archive.asp#056399">K-Lo</a></div>
