<p>You know, the liars who pollute science with this trash bother me, but not as much as the idiots on the street who believe it.&nbsp; Particularly, the teachers in this country who became teachers, not to educate, but to indotrinate.&nbsp; My kids have experienced these monsters numerous times.&nbsp; Three years ago, I got a teacher to drop a math book--MATH--because every word problem involved things like, "Scientists have concluded that most of the islands in the South Pacific will be drowned because of global warming . . . "&nbsp; </p>
<p>It's time we teach our kids, at home, to debunk teachers and leftist textbooks in the class room.&nbsp; I'm not a big fan of uppity kids, but I'm absolutely opposed to leftists indoctrination in the schools. </p>
