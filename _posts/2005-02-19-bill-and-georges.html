<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/19/politics/19friends.html?">New York Times </a>print edition has a delightful story about the new friendship between George Bush 41 and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Some of was pretty harsh on Clinton during his presidency, and Im certainly in that group.&nbsp; But a friendship between the presidents father and predecessor is good for everyone.</p>
<p>George H. W. Bush, a terrible politician and so-so leader, is a wonderful human being.&nbsp; Bill Clinton is a man of no real political convictions, endless charm, and endearing wit.&nbsp; Most of my disagreements with Clinton dealt, not with his liberalism, but with he lack thereof.&nbsp; If liberalism is, indeed, <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/17/1118.aspx">bookless and dying</a>, Clinton deserve much of the blame. It was his triangulation that gave us welfare reform, the most important legislation in half a century.</p>
<p>We've heard the George 43 and Clinton also enjoy one another's company.&nbsp; Perhaps their human bonding will defrost some of the rancor in Washington.&nbsp; That, too, would be a very good thing for everyone. </p>
