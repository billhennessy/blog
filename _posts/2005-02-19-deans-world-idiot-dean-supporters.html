<p><a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1108836309.shtml">Dean's World  </a>noticed that a Howard Dean support threw a shoe at Richard Perle when Perle began speaking at debate against Howard in Oregon yesterday.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Joe Gandelman, guest blogger, asks several questions about the mental state of the person who threw the shoe.&nbsp; But this is typical Deaniac behavior.&nbsp; Its why <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/17/1113.aspx">Dr. Dean wanted no press </a>at the affair.&nbsp; His side has nothing to say, save for we have more shoes than we need, so you take some. </p>
