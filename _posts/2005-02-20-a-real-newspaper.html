<p>Once upon a time, St. Louis had two major dailies:&nbsp; the St. Louis Globe-Democrat and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.&nbsp; The Globe was the conservative newspaper.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s where Pat Buchanan got his start.&nbsp; The Post was the liberal paper.&nbsp; Then the Globe folded, leaving St. Louis with only the lefty paper.</p>
<p>Since then, the quality of the Post has dropped precipitously.&nbsp; It is now a very bad paper with lousy writing, absent-minded editing, and incomplete coverage.&nbsp; Facts are missed.&nbsp; Stories have holes.&nbsp; Most infuriating, though, the paper simple doesn&rsquo;t cover news. </p>
<p>Yesterday, I found myself stranded at Starbuck&rsquo;s for an hour.&nbsp; I bought a print edition of the New York Times.&nbsp; As much as I despise that paper, its smell, the rough pages in my hands, the font, the words flowing into sentences forming paragraphs and revealing stories was heaven.</p>
<p>While NYT may be completely out of touch, at least it still reads like a real newspaper.&nbsp; For anyone living in a town with just one terrible paper, the appreciation is almost overwhelming.</p>
<p>Still,&nbsp;the NYT has a problem with the truth.&nbsp; As&nbsp;reported on <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/archives/005146.php">Wizbang</a>, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001556.htm">Michelle Malkin</a>, and <a href="http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/new_full_story.php?subcatcode=22&amp;catname=Offbeat&amp;newscode=450378004">other sites</a>, the Baby 81 story&mdash;a New York Times exclusive&mdash;was a hoax.&nbsp; How many hoaxes or fabrications&nbsp;can one newspaper succumb to?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Which leads me to my questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;are major dailies dead?&nbsp; Do they serve any purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is quality newspaper production&nbsp;economically infeasible?&nbsp; And, finally, what would it take to start and operate a good, profitable city daily?&nbsp; </p>
