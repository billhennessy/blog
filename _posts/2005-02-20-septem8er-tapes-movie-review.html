<p>Movies that mimic documentaries often fall short in both emotional impact and believability.&nbsp; The September Tapes, by First Look Pictures, breaks that trend.<br />
A man lost his young wife on Sepember 11, 2001, a passenger on one of the planes.&nbsp;&nbsp; In desparation and dissatisfied with the US military's progress in finding and killing bin Laden, Don Larson sells all of his worldly possessions to finance a trip to Afghanistan to get answers on the hunt for bin Laden from the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first armed only with a camera and flanked by an interpreter/guide, Wali, and camerman, Sonny, Larson starts off in Kabul the day after Afghanistans Vice President, Haji Abdul Qadeer, was assassinated in his Kabul office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Action in this film starts quickly:&nbsp; Black-clad Taliban fighters kill a motorist outside Larson's window.&nbsp; A meeting with arms dealers goes ary when Wali, the interpreter, freaks.&nbsp; Larson gets himself arrested, hoping to meet Taliban fighters and al Qaeda detainees in the Kabul jail.</p>
<p>Instead of fighters, though, Larson meets General Dil, Afghanistan's head of narcotics enforcment.&nbsp; Dil puts Larson in touch with a Babak Ali, a bounty hunter who is preparing a trip to Khost on the Pakistan border where he intends to ambush bin Laden's entourage.</p>
<p>Despite $25,000 bounties for the heads of Westerners, Larson decides to take Wali and Sonny out of the relative safety of Kabul and into Afghanistan's post-Taliban badlands.</p>
<p>The film makes you wish you were Don Larson--not because of his loss, but becuase of his courage.&nbsp;He pushes on with full knowledge that his life is in jeopardy.&nbsp; He pushes on to places that weaker men would not go.&nbsp; He does the things that most of only talk about:&nbsp; hunting bin Laden.&nbsp; As with so many war correspondents, circumstances force Larson to take sides in battle.&nbsp; After an encounter with Muslim thieves on the road to Khost, Babak gives Larson an AK-47 and ammo.&nbsp; Within a day, Larson puts the gun to good use, wounding or killing two al Qaeda fighters in an ambush of Babak. </p>
<p>Go rent September Tapes today.&nbsp; Tomorrow, you'll be asking the government, When the hell are we going to kill that son of a bitch?</p>
