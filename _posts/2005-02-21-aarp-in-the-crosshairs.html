<p><a href="http://www.themoderatevoice.com/posts/1109013509.shtml">Its about time</a>. Joe Gandelman points out that the people who brought you the Swift Vets are taking aim on the AARPa corrupt, leftist organization committed to stealing from the young and giving to the old whilst limiting freedom for everyone and outlawing cell phones.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I despise the <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/15/William.aspx">AARP </a>and everything it stands for, particularly its blogroll.&nbsp; (Find it yourselfIm not providing a link to the wealthy old bastards.)</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; The spineless weasels took down their Blogroll.&nbsp; It's not there.&nbsp; Even a search of their site will not find it.&nbsp; I e-mailed the org, asking why they took it down--like they'll ever answer me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Organized Old People are just as dangerous as organized crime.&nbsp; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Well, I apologize.&nbsp; USA Next's first attempt at attacking AARP was misguided, inappropriate, offensive, and counterproductive.&nbsp; They'd have accomplished more by sending AARP a $100,000 donation.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1109101301.shtml"> Dean Esmay </a>has a good description.</p>
