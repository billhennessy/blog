<p>Anti-War lefties hang American Soldier in effigy. Good job, folks.&nbsp; That convinced me:&nbsp; Im wrong.&nbsp; Lets pull all of the troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq.&nbsp; South Korea, too.&nbsp; Life was so much better for those people without us.&nbsp; Except for the South Koreans, who would be so much better off with Kim Jong ILL as their slavemaster.&nbsp; </p>
