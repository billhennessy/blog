<p>You might have caught my<a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/17/1115.aspx"> running, er, conversation </a>&nbsp;(expand comments) with someone calling himself SoupMan.&nbsp;After a few shots at him (some unfair, I admit), he disclosed the link to his blog, <a href="http://hiphoppolitics.blogspot.com/">Hip-Hop Politics</a>.&nbsp; I took a look around.&nbsp; I wasn't surprised by anything. Obviously, I don't agree with anything, but nothing was shocking.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mr. SoupMan was reluctant to share his link with me.&nbsp; He didn't want hassles he'd experienced before.&nbsp; I suspected that I'd attack him mercilessly, which did surprise me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyway, if you get a chance, check out his site.&nbsp; But please, please, be polite.&nbsp; We're guests on each others blogs--not family.&nbsp; </p>
