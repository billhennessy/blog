<blockquote>
<p>"We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the dessert, when the drugs began to take hold."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's how begins the book that drove me to misspend a significant portion of my youth.&nbsp; I first read&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;keyword=0679785892&amp;index=books">Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas</a></u> in 1982 after graduating from high school.&nbsp; If marijuana is a gateway drug, it's literary equivalent is <u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;keyword=Catcher%20in%20the%20Rye&amp;index=books">Catcher in the Rye</a></u>.&nbsp; Fear and Loathing is literary adrenichrome.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I was in Personnelman Class A School in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1985, I passed the book around during a long holiday weekend.&nbsp; About two dozen young sailors, most of whom had yet to see a ship, took rooms&nbsp;<span>at </span>the local Holiday Inn on Wednesday evening.&nbsp; We were free until Monday.&nbsp; The bookstore around the corner had 11 copies of Fear and Loathing until we raided the place at 8:00 Wednesday night.&nbsp; As young, innocent kids from Oklahoma and South Dakota absorbed the decadent significance of Raoul Duke's famous journal, things got gradually more crazy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't know the exact statute of limitations for such things, so I officially deny any knowledge of illegal drug usage by any member of the United States Navy or Marine Corp during the four days and nights in question.&nbsp; I can report, though, that we consumed dangerous quanitities of every legal drug available--primarily alcohol.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While Wednesday was calm, with reading around the Holidome pool, Thursday and Friday nights are mere blurs.&nbsp; I know I met a couple of female sailors in someone's room--not mine or theirs--but details escape me.&nbsp; One of them had a comical overbite that seemed like a deadly weapon.&nbsp; The other one, I think, kept making vague marriage proposals.&nbsp; I don't know if they were directed at me or at the Beaver.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The room looked the scene of a failed zoological experiment involving whiskey and gorillas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saturday night, though, left an indelible impression on the most drug polluted mind.&nbsp; The police were called to the hotel at least 19 times between 2 PM and midnight.&nbsp; One sailor was seriously injured when he attempted to jump from the second floor balcony into the pool 20 feet below and a good forty feet out from the balcony's edge.&nbsp; He came up seven feet short--four feet if you count the bounce.&nbsp; Like a catalyst, I had hunkered down in my room with Jack Daniels and Budweiser at 3:00 in the afternoon.&nbsp; Though the book I introduced caused the nighmarish carnival of mayhem, I just watched from window overlooking the Holidome.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were less than a mile from the last known hideout of the Manson family.&nbsp; How long before our guest made that grim connection?"&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor bastards down there had no idea what had hit them.&nbsp; It was a literary speedball with&nbsp;<span>a </span>shot of acid and an ether chaser.&nbsp; They were doomed. </p>
<p>Tonight, I learned from <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001559.htm">Michelle Malkin's link </a>to to an AP story that Hunter S. Thompson, the Doctor of Democracy and of Gonzo Journalism., an ordained minister with a Doctor of Divinity degree, lost his long battle aginst death.&nbsp; Those of us who read all of his books and survived feel more vulnerable, now, like green soldiers in a combat zone when their sergent goes down hard.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>" . . . Hubert Humphry,&nbsp;his hands flapping and cackling like three iguanas in a feeding frenzy."&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thompson would hate my politics as I hated his.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;respect the daylights out of his writing, his brilliant cleverness, and the length of his career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"I try not to shoot people, and I never kill more than I can eat."</p>
<p>When he could find so little humor in the world of 2003, we should have known that the end was near. I will miss the&nbsp;<span>good d</span>octor.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp;&nbsp;I just&nbsp;let myself understand that&nbsp;Thompson killed himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>When he first started his Page 2 column on ESPN.com, he seemed fresh and reinvigorated.&nbsp; But, after a while, he could only write about gambling problems, or so it seemed.&nbsp; Like Spalding Gray, seeing humor only in dark things and darkness in everything eventually undid his world.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But we're left with some wonderful writing and more quotes than from Blazing Saddles. </p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; The Thompson quotes on this page are from memory.&nbsp; If I'm off a little, forgive me.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6281">There is irony in Steven Taylor's discussion blog</a>.&nbsp; He wants to whether youthful drug use is a political killer, and how damaging it is to hide it.&nbsp; Well, obviously, I'm pretty liberal about my own indiscretions, but I'm not running of high office (as the entire free world breathes a healthy sigh of relief).&nbsp;For my part, I think hiding mistakes is far worse than making them.&nbsp; I disagree with Bush's position about disclosing drug use, even though his consistency on the point is remarkable.&nbsp; His daughters problems in college demonstrate that, while honesty may not have prevented them from getting wild, hiding his own past certainly didn't stop them, either.&nbsp;</p>
