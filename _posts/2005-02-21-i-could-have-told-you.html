<p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002182315_security17.html">Windows is more secure than Linux </a>for operating a web site, so concludes an independent study.&nbsp; And in more than ten years of helping companies embrace the internet and new technology, I can assure you that&nbsp; a front-to-back Microsoft solution is the least expensive possible.&nbsp; Sun hardware/Oracle DB is the most expensive and has the longest time to market.&nbsp; Linux lands in the middle of everything.&nbsp; </p>
