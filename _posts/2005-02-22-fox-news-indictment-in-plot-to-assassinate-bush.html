<p>Read it <strike>hear</strike> here.&nbsp;(I can't spell.)&nbsp;Of course, the liberal MSM will make this punk into a hero overnight.&nbsp; Watch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,148338,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,148338,00.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://lashawnbarber.com/archives/2005/02/22/local/">LaShawn Barber </a>nails it</p>
<p>According to Fox News, over 100 supporters of this cretin packed the courtroom and mocked the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; This raises a few questions, namely, did we place electronic surveillance instruments on them as they were leaving, and did we scan their faces for links to al Qaeda?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9351">OTB wonders </a>what our education system taught them.&nbsp; Perhaps the same thing it taught the Future Terrorists of American in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Geez, did I upset<a href="http://www.hairyfishnuts.com/#222051218PM"> this charming fellow</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His prescient conclusion?&nbsp; "Yeah that ten year Hessian insurgency was a real drag. And the way Mexico got all their guys into key points of power to make the U.S.A. a theocracy? I see your point."&nbsp; </p>
<p>I really need to stop arguing with clairvoyants.&nbsp; </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.gopbloggers.org/mt/archives/000455.html">Mark Kilmer</a>, the thug idiot faces 80 years in jail. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <em><a href="http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/003787.html"><font>I told you so</font></a></em>.&nbsp; And <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7012172/">MSNBC</a>.&nbsp; And <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/22/opinion/courtwatch/main675804.shtml">CBS News </a>with his nugget:&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least now the young man knows what charges he faces; knows (for the most part) what rules will apply in his case; and knows that his fate ultimately will be decided by a federal judge and jury. That's a far cry from living at the whim of Saudi intelligence officers. It's a far cry from having to guess at the evidence against you; and it's a far cry from wondering whether your fingernails are going to be ripped off you again after they have grown back. </p>

<p>Poor little fella.&nbsp; And some lefties call me a tool for merely suggesting that the MSM might crown this punk Victim of the Year.&nbsp; </p>
