<p>Yeah, I know they won't reply, but I figured I should ask, anyway. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rocky Mountain News today claims that Mr. Ward Churchill received tenure as a result of Colorado University's failure to explore an alleged offer of tenure from the University of California system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am interested in knowing whether or not Mr. Churchill implied such offer was made, or if someone at Colorado merely assumed such.&nbsp; Any information on this matter would be greatly appreciated and may help <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6289">clear the reputation</a> of the University of Colorado.</p>
<p>Cordially,<br />Bill Hennessy </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sent individual e-mails to each member of the board.&nbsp; If I get anything back, I'll let you know.&nbsp; Perhaps one of them will speak off the record.&nbsp; </p>
