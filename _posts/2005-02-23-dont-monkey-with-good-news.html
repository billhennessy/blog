<p><a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6298">Steven Taylor </a>rightly predicts that today's top story will be the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45323-2005Feb22.html?referrer=email">Washington Post </a>report that the White House redacted the whole of the report on Iraq's economy from last week's economic report.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The story claims that the good news about Iraq's economy would be inappropriate at a time when so many security problems exist.&nbsp; That rings hollow.&nbsp; The President could use some good news in his European trip, and the whole world could use some good news about Iraq.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While I usually admonish administrations to stick to their guns, in this case, I feel inclined to encourage the White House to release whatever was removed.&nbsp; The American people are a hearty bunch and can usually handle the truth--even when it's good news.&nbsp; </p>
