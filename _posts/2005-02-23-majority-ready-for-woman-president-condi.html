<p>I saw this several placed yesterday, but <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9359">OTB</a> has the write up that made me read.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I'm not quite ready to jump on the Condi 08 bandwagon just yet, this is a very encouraging story for those who have.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, I think it most likely that our first female president and our first black president will come from the party viewed as the more conservative.&nbsp; If you're going to tear down walls, might as well kill two archaic birds with one stone, right?&nbsp; </p>
