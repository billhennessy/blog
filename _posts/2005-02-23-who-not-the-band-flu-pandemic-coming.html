<blockquote>
<p>We at WHO believe that the world is now in the gravest possible danger of a pandemic, Dr. Shigeru Omi, the WHOs Western Pacific regional director, said Wednesday. (<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6861065/">source</a>)</p>

<p>I mentioned this the other day in a blog, and it still chills me.&nbsp; The good news is that the Avian strain that&nbsp;so concerns&nbsp;the WHO and others still requires direct contact with infected birds.&nbsp; It has not yet mutated to cross-infect humans.&nbsp; But that situation may not last long.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We dont know whether the virus that is currently circulating among poultry in southeast Asia, the H5N1, will eventually be able to reassort its genetic material with a human influenza virus. That is the key question, Professor Albert Osterhaus, a leading European virologist at Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
