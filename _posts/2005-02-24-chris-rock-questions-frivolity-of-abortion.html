<p>The Chris Rock quote that got so many conservatives so up in arms about abortion appears to be more pro-life than pro-choice, according to <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2113952/">John Swansburg writing on Slate</a>. </p>
<p>The controversy involves this line from Rock:&nbsp; "It's beautiful that abortion is legal" and says that he likes to pick up women at abortion rallies. "'Cause you know they're [expletive]."</p>
<p>But that isolated sentiment is part of a larger theme in Rock's routine, and, in reasonable context, constitutes a slap at the frivolity of "choice." </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When a woman gets pregnant, it's a choice between the woman"here Rock pauses, a mischievous grin barely restrained"and her girlfriends." From there: "One girlfriend goes, 'Child, you should have that babythat man got some good hair' And the other girlfriend says, 'Child, why we even talking about thisain't we supposed to go to Cancun next week? Get rid of that baby!' " And that, Rock says, "is how life is decided in America."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds more like Pat Buchanan than Patricia Ireland.</p>
<p>I stayed out of the Rock controversy when it was boiling because a) I could not care less what a comedian says in his routine, and b) I had a feeling some on the right needed to adopt my attitude mentioned in a) above. I'm glad I did.&nbsp; If I were a Chris Rock fan, I supposed I'd have known the complete bit, but I'm not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It seems that Rock's attitude is very reflective of many Americans.&nbsp; We are cautious about saying "you can't" to anything, but we are suspicious about why you'd want to.&nbsp;When someone wants the "right" to have an abortion,&nbsp;we think of a child asking his parent, "what if I got a detention?" &nbsp; In Rock's words we hear that the legality of abortion means little, but the willingness to commit leaves him cold and questioning.&nbsp; A swimming suit or a child.&nbsp; Moral equals?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Which brings us to the whole problem of semantics.&nbsp; Were I to tell you that hiking the north 100 miles of the Appalachian Trail were risky, you might think of delays, twisted ankles, and other inconveniences.&nbsp; But were I to say those same 100 miles were dangerous, you might picture cat amounts, landslides--perhaps that one in every 100 hikers is never seen nor heard from again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The abortion industry commandeered the word "choice" a long time ago.&nbsp; A choice is between two options of relatively equal value.&nbsp; A decision, on the other hand, is weightier.&nbsp; It involves "choosing" between peril and safety, right and wrong, good and evil.&nbsp; At its moral best, an abortion might be murder.&nbsp; We don't know.&nbsp; But whether or not to risk another's death cannot be a choice.&nbsp; It must be a very carefully weighed decision.&nbsp; The abortionist knows that treating abortion as a moral decision and not a choice of mere convenience among moral equivalents will make abortion economically unfeasible.&nbsp; While law may permit the act, there would be little financial incentive to make the procedure one's specialty.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To those one the right who oppose abortion and feel lost in the political or court system, you may want to champion Chris Rock's attitude:&nbsp; it's not a choice, it's moral decision that may or may not equal murder.&nbsp; </p>
