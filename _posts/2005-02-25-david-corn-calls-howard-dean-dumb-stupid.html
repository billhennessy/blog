<p><a href="http://www.davidcorn.com/2005/02/dean_goes_selfd.php">David Corn</a>, the guy who's just to the left of DemocraticUnderground, blogged today on Howard Dean, and it's must reading.&nbsp; Except for snivelling about health care and the usual mantra of socialist causes, I could have written the piece.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Basically, Corn says what we already know:&nbsp; Howard Dean is his own worst enemy, and, as DNC chairman, is turning into his party's worst enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifially, Corn&nbsp;responds to Dean's recent announcement that people are afraid to call themselves Democrats because&nbsp;"it's not socially acceptable to be a Democrat." </p>
<p>&nbsp;No need for analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The beauty is just reading Corn's shots as bullets, so here we go . . . </p>
<ul>
<li>This is the defeatist talk--or dumb talk.
</li>
<li>he [Dean]&nbsp;came with too much baggage
</li>
<li>[Dean] might jump the rails (rhetorically) too often
</li>
<li>&nbsp;he [Dean] &nbsp;made a stupid crack
</li>
<li>Was he [Dean] indicating that when he thinks of hotel workers he thinks of black and brown people?
</li>
<li>it is not a bright thing to say [that being Democrat is socially unacceptable]
</li>
<li>It does make the party seem marginal and out-of-step with <i>real</i> America
</li>
<li>This comment also sounds like whining.
</li>
<li>Dean is coming out, in these early innings, a bit shaky</li>
</ul>
<p>So before you start saying it's ridiculous to call a medical doctor stupid, remember two things:&nbsp; First, he is not a doctor of democracy or of politics.&nbsp; In political speech, Howard Dean is an idiot.&nbsp; Second, one of the left-est political commentators in America refers to Dean's remarks as "defeatist", "dumb", "stupid", "not . . . bright", and "whining."&nbsp; So, I'd have to say not alone on this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nod to <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/021371.php">Instapundit</a>.</p>
<p>BTW, I know I write about Dean and Churchill a lot, but people seem to like it.&nbsp; Those two subjects, plus the UN, get twice as many page views as all my other stuff put together.&nbsp;</p>
