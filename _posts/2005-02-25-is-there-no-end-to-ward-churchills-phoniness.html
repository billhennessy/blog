<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001596.htm">Michelle Malkin </a>has&nbsp; dug up some artwork claimed to be the original work of Terrorist Advocate Ward Churchill.&nbsp; But, clearly, the works are not original, unless Mr. Churchill channels 19th century western artists and photographers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To those who say Churchill speaks for the American Indian better than anyone else, I say that his words that have so enchanted you most likely were plagiarized.</p>
<p>Since Churchill's rabid defenders will not expend the energy to click Michelle's link, here's the pertinent part of a CBS4 in Denver story Michelle reprinted in whole:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Boulder County resident Duke Prentup has been a fan of native American art for as long as he can remember. That love of art took him to the home of Ward Churchill in the early 1980's, where Prentup bought several pieces of Churchill's art, including a serigraph titled "Winter Attack." </p>
<p>"I have enjoyed them ever since immensely, they're obviously up inside my house," Prentup said.</p>
<p>Last month came a stunning revelation, though, as as Prentup flipped through a 1972 book called The Mystic Warriors of the Plains written and illustrated by the late artist Thomas E. Mails. He found a sketch that was strikingly similar to the Churchill piece.</p>
<p>"I opened it up, and Wham, there it was," he said. "It's the exact same thing, only mirror imaged virtually to every detail."</p>
<p>Intellectual property attorney James Hubbell compared the two works side by side, concluding it was likely no accident.</p>
<p>"It's very obvious that the Churchill piece was taken directly from the Mails' piece, there's just too many similarities between the two for it to have been coincidence."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On another site, someone referred to Churchill as Chief Sitting Bullshit.&nbsp; How apt. </p>
<p>BTW, make you sure you check out Michelle's updates, too.&nbsp; Great stuff, there. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Michelle has posted even more links demonstrating Churchill's rampant intellectual property theft.&nbsp; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/23/1214.aspx"> If you haven't read this piece, please do so.</a>&nbsp; I struck-through the references to the erroneous I'm Not an Indian story.&nbsp; That isn't much.&nbsp; The rest of the piece is only reinforced by subsequent events.&nbsp; Ward Churchill is as phony as a&nbsp;discount store&nbsp;toupee.&nbsp; </p>
