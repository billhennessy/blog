<p>You can't make this stuff up.&nbsp; Over at the <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=102&amp;topic_id=1263290&amp;mesg_id=1263290">DemocraticUnderground</a>, they're seriously talking about regulating salt.&nbsp; You know, the stuff you put on french fries. Why?&nbsp; Because, unless you're a liberal slumming on this site, you're too stupid to know how much salt to put on your food, poor thing.&nbsp; You don't think they think you're stupid?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some wretched creature had the audacity to say this to the Dems who want to keep their salt:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because you whine about them [food regulations and taxes], doesn't mean they don't make sense in the abstract. Putting a tax on foods with a high fat content is one way to recoup costs externalized on society by their manufacturers. </p>
<p>Maybe if you studied a little more economics and watched less TV, you might understand what Jacobson is talking about.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the 1970s, there was a frightening commercial depicting future man as a human head with no body in a box being moved around by humanoid, white robots.&nbsp; If the DNC had its way, that man of the future would be you tomorrow. </p>
