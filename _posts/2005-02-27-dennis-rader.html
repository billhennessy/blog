<p>The BTK killer's name is Dennis Rader.&nbsp; He is&nbsp;the poison that grows on the bottom of a cesspool.&nbsp; He is the stuff that Hell considers too vile to abide.&nbsp; He is sin incarnate. </p>
<p>A brave, good neighbor of his called him out two days after another neighbor died.&nbsp; She was a good woman dying of cancer with a little dog.&nbsp; She would let the dog out to go potty, and Dennis Rader, Animal Control Officer, would give her a citation.&nbsp; He knew full well that she was too sick to go outside with the dog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dennis Rader wanted authority.&nbsp; He wanted power.&nbsp; The proper functioning of society prevented him from acquiring real power, so he seized the perverted, hateful, vengeful power he could.&nbsp; He used his pseudo-cop badge to bully women in his neighborhood, reporting uncut lawns to a neighborhood association resulting in $300 fines to the resident.&nbsp; He tried his level to best to make the aforementioned cancer patient's final days a living hell.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If anyone knows how to contact inmate in Kansas's penal system, I'd like to know.&nbsp; I want to make sure that every lifer knows the depths of this man's evil.&nbsp; I want them to know the way he raped and hanged a little girl from the rafters of her basement after murdering her brother, mother, and father, leaving the horrid scene for the little girl's 19-year-old brother to find.&nbsp; They may use the information as they deem fit, but every inmate in the Kansas penal system deserves to know the details of their new neighbor.&nbsp; </p>
