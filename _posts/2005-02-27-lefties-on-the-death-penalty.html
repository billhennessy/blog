<p>Well, we know that the left opposes the death penalty for the likes of Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, but some do support capital punishment for political speech and activity.&nbsp; <a href="http://magic-city-news.com/article_3206.shtml">Stephen Crockett </a>wants murder Katherine Harris and Ken Blackwell because they're Republicans.&nbsp; Combine this with the DUer who wants to beat the crap out of the 9-year-old for Social Security reform, and you have the makings of a leftwing lynch mob.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But they're the compassionate ones.&nbsp; Rrrriiiigghhhhttt.&nbsp; </p>
