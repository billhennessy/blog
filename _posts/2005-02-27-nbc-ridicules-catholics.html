<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001607.htm">Michelle Malkin </a>has much about a recent "Committed" episode on NBC in which the producers went out of their way to make a mockery of Catholicism.&nbsp;&nbsp; She makes an excellent point with a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will NBC be as responsive to the complaints of Catholic viewers as FOX was to the <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=42770"><font>Muslims </font></a>who protested the hit drama <em>24</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer:&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; Muslims are now a protected group, while Catholics are still an undesirable minority for ripe the kind of social genocide liberals have advocated for years.&nbsp; </p>
