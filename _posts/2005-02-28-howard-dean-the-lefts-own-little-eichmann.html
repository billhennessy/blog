<p><span>Okay, I know I'm not a genius like the mad doctor from Vermont, but could someone explain the logic of Dean's latest idiotic blusterfest?</span></p>
<p><span>On the one hand, he extolls (kind of) the virtues of "tolerance":</span></p>
<p><span></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Moderate Republicans can't stand these people (conservatives), because they're intolerant. They don't think tolerance is a virtue," Dean said, adding: "I'm not going to have these right-wingers throw away our right to be tolerant."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And immediately delcares that anyone who disagree with Democrats is "evil":</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And concluding his backyard speech with a litany of Democratic values, he added: "This is a struggle of good and evil. And we're the good."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But Dean is tolerant of evil, much like the Germans who "didn't know."&nbsp; So Dean exemplifies Edmund Burke's conclusion that "All that is necessary for evil to succeed is that good men do nothing."&nbsp; Since lefties won't read Burke, Einstein said something similar:&nbsp; "The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing."</p>
<p>By promoting tolerance for evil, Dean promotes evil.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Therefore, Dean is either evil or an idiot.&nbsp; (For the record, I think he's just an idiot.)</p>
