<p>Children go missing all the time.&nbsp; Every incident takes a bit of life out of normal people.&nbsp; But there's something about this little girl's smile that absolutely tears me apart inside.&nbsp; Maybe something about her eyes reminds me of my late daughter. I don't know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I pray that she is unharmed--physically and psychologically.&nbsp; Logically, I know the odds are really, really low, but, God, I pray&nbsp; for most naive hope.</p>
<p>And if she's not, I hope the horrible freak who would stoop to visit any harm to such a beautiful little girl meets a fate worse than any psychopathic torture junky could dream up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,148867,00.html">FoxNews</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Despite heavy rain and a tornado watch, nearly 540 volunteers turned out to comb the rural community of 2,300 people, about 60 miles north of <strong>Tampa</strong> (<a href="siteSearch('Tampa');">search</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">But she's still not home where she belongs, and I'm still praying she gets home soon.&nbsp; God bless her.</p>
