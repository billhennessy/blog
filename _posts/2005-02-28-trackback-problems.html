  content: Fortunately it amuses as before................I'm trying to keep away
    from reading posts like this. It is totally meaningless. Ain't it shame to post
    rubbish like this?

<p>Community Server is supposed to automatically generate trackbacks in the comments of blog entries whenever someone with a common system (mt, .blog, etc.) links.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it doesn't always work.&nbsp; So . . . </p>
<p>If you link to a blog entry and no trackback generates on Hennessys's view</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; Create a manual trackback in the Comments or</p>
<p>b) E-mail me with the Contact link, and I'll create one for you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you e-mail me, please include the blog software you use so I can fix this defect in my software.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bill</p>
