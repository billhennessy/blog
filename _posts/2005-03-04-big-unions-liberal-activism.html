<p>The union workers I grew up around weren't liberals by any stretch.&nbsp; They were Archie Bunker (and I mean that in a good way).&nbsp; Since the early 1980s, though, their unions have abandoned putting workers first in favor of putting leftwing ideology first.&nbsp; The result has been a massive exodus from the union shops into non-union companies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But the unions have also done a disservice to the entire middle class.&nbsp; By concentrating on politics instead of labor issues, the AFL-CIO and other big unions have favored policies that destroy middle class jobs.&nbsp; In a sense, they suffer from the same problems abortionists do--they're killing their own.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/1,,SB110989783333870237,00.html?mod=TOPIC"> WSJ has an insightful</a>, short analysis of the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The AFL-CIO] became part of the ideological left and its regulatory and high-tax agenda. So instead of favoring oil drilling in Alaska, which would create thousands of new middle-class jobs, Mr. Sweeney's shop leaned toward the rich liberals of the Sierra Club. And while many union members are cultural conservatives, the AFL-CIO has spent its scarce political capital fighting conservative judges. No wonder millions of workers look at union organizers and shrug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I don't necessarily favor a major move back into unions, I do wish that what remains of the labor movement would return to its original purpose and let Hollywood liberals fight their own battles.</p>
