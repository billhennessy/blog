<p><em><font>Today the consequences of your un-American and anti-Constitutional Campaign Finance Reform bill reached their totalitarian zenith as the FEC made clear that the people no longer have the right to voice their political beliefs on web logs.&nbsp; </font></em></p>
<p><em><font>Since 2000, Senator, you have worked overtime at binding the spirit and body of the American people.&nbsp; You deny us, the people, free speech.&nbsp; You deny us, the people, free movement.&nbsp; You deny us, the people, the freedom other men died to give you in Vietnam.&nbsp; You, of all people, should appreciate this glorious gift our founders and God have given us.&nbsp; Instead, you try to take it away.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font>I will fight your totalitarian legislation tooth and nail.&nbsp; I have begun by exploring the creation of a Blogger Legal Defense Fund.&nbsp; I will continue to voice my opinion by any means I deem fit, and I will blog from prison if necessary.&nbsp; You have my address--come and stop me.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font>Please resign from the Senate and give your seat to someone wbo appreciates freedom, understands history, and deserves the high honor of that office.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font>Sincerely,<br />William T. Hennessy</font></em></p>
<p><font>Update: <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/">Michelle Malkin </a>linked to<a href="http://decision08.blogspot.com/2005/03/my-second-open-letter-in-two-days.html"> Mike Coffey's</a> open letter to McCain.&nbsp; Coffey's letter kills with kindness.&nbsp; I understand that many people have great respect for McCain stemming from his years in a North Vietnamese prison camp.&nbsp; I, too, admire his service.&nbsp; I do not, however, admire him.&nbsp; As I've documented on this blog, I once considered McCain-Kerrey (Neb) the perfect presidential match-up.&nbsp; But McCain proved a weak character in his 2000 campaign when he lied about Pat Buchanan over and over again.&nbsp; Buchanan was not McCain's chief rival--W was.&nbsp; Still, McCain kicked an easy target, a dead horse.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>My personal dislike of John McCain prevents me from sucking up to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hat's off to those who can. <a href="http://rightintx.blogspot.com/">My friend in Texas </a>backs up my tone:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's about time someone nails McCain instead of everyone sucking up to him. <span><font>(FYI: I dont much like McCain) </font></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><font>Thanks, Michelle.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span><font>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.theamericanmind.com/mt-test/archives/016493.html">The American Mind </a>express due resentment toward Messrs McCain and Feingold.&nbsp; I, however, will not move anything off-shore, nor will I anonymatize myself.&nbsp; I gave McCain my address--he can come hunt me down if he wants. <br />FLASHBACK:&nbsp; My <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2002/04/01/1088.aspx">open letter to McCain from April, 2002</a><br /></font></span></p>
