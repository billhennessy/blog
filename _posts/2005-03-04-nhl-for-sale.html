<p>For $3.5 billion, it could be yours.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/1,,SB110988688740669890,00.html?mod=TOPIC">Wall Street Journal </a>reports that he NHL is considering selling itself to a group in Boston:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The audacious move to buy the NHL is the first of its kind involving a major U.S. sports league. If successful, a sale would convert the NHL from a collection of 30 individual franchises to what's known in the sports industry as a single entity. Such centralized ownership, used by Major League Soccer, the Women's National Basketball Association and other smaller leagues, significantly reduces the free-market competition for players that has characterized hockey and other sports for decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hockey is my favorite sport, and I miss the NHL.&nbsp; This move, however, scares me.&nbsp; What if the owner decided it wanted to get out of the hockey business?&nbsp; Still, anything to have a season next year, and anything to keep the ticket prices in line.&nbsp; </p>
