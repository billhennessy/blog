<p>Former Clinton White House aide Nancy Soderberg admitted on The Daily Show that she and other Democrats want Bush&rsquo;s war against terrorism to fail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/3/5/65606.shtml">NewsMax.com: Inside Cover Story</a></p>
<p><em>After noting that the U.S.'s stunning foreign policy success followed the toppling of one of the three members of the axis of evil, Soderberg suggested again that the more success America has in defeating global terrorism, the worse it is for her party.</p>
<p>"Well, there's still Iran and North Korea, don't forget. There's still hope for the rest of us ... There's always hope that this might not work." </em></p>
<p>When people criticize me for being too partisan, this is why.&nbsp; Many Democrats, like Ms. Soderberg, are anti-American.&nbsp; They hate this country.&nbsp; </p>
