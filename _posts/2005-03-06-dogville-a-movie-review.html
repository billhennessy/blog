<p>Acting class.&nbsp; The actor and the scene.&nbsp; Script.&nbsp; Or not.&nbsp; Mime.&nbsp; Gibberish.&nbsp; Make believe.&nbsp; A wise director, in response to an actor's complaint about lack of motivation, said, "it's all make believe."&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the best acting, the more "make believe" the presentation, the more real.&nbsp; A great play demands that you strip the stage of technology and present truth in angry, cold, black and white, two-dimensional reality.&nbsp; Truth shines through, unencumbered by sets and lights.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The actor and the scene.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Script.</p>
<p>Or not. </p>
<p>Dogville is the only movie I've ever seen that presents itself as bare and pure as the best theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the story of a beautiful girl who runs away from gangsters and hides out in small, wholesome mining town in Colorado.&nbsp; Dogville is a town that's so open it even has a couple of token negroes, which was rare in the 1930s when the movie is set.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But the town realizes, slowly, that the girl's life depends on their protection.&nbsp; One by one, their kindness and hospitality turns a little greedy.&nbsp; If only the people of Dogville knew the whole story of the girl they protected and exploited.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is one of the best films I've ever seen.&nbsp; Rent Dogville today.&nbsp; Watch it with grown ups, only.&nbsp; It's not appropriate for the young.&nbsp; If you want the experience of a stage play that matches the intensity and honesty of Dogville, read "<a href="http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=15455">The Visit" by Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt </a>(1956).</p>
