<p>Senator John McCain, the Keating Five escapee who put his name on a bill intended to destroy the First Amendment, has been caught with his hand in the till.&nbsp; </p>
<p>According to the<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050308/D88MFUN00.html"> Associated Press</a>, one of the few organizations that stands to gain politically under McCain-Feingold, the Senator and former POW pressed for pricing changes on behalf of Cablevision while soliciting $200,000 from Cablevision for one of McCain's tax-exempt political action committees, The Reform Institute.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCain's assistance in 2003 and 2004 was sandwiched around two donations of $100,000 each from Cablevision to The Reform Institute, the tax-exempt group that touts McCain's views and has showcased him at events since his unsuccessful 2000 presidential campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teddy Kennedy praises Bush's foreign policy, Syria backs up in Lebanon, Michelle Malkin posts a hot new photo, the BTK killer is depressed, Robert Byrd is proven a hypocrite, Ward Churchill's life's in shambles, and, now, the AP is taking down John McCain--looks like Ronald Reagan's finished his in-processing in Heaven and has gotten down to business.</p>
