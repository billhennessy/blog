<p>This might be the most instructive table I've ever seen. </p>
<p>Notice that most of the major news sources place the Terrorist Rally in Beirut third.&nbsp; Also notice that most of the MSPs refer to the rallies as sponsored by Hezbollah.&nbsp; In this pattern, the New York Times stands out--not because it's the paper of record, but because it's completely out of touch with reality.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Clearly, the NYT's headline writer could hardly contain her glee:&nbsp; Huge Pro-Syrian Protest Fills Square and Streets in Beirut</p>
<p>I can see the champaigne corks flying across the room in the NYT Building.&nbsp; Back slapping and promises of raises to undeserving middle managers.&nbsp; "We've won!" they shout.&nbsp; "Democracy is overturned.&nbsp; The people want tyranny!" </p>
<p>Here's the finest example of yellow journalism I've seen since . . .&nbsp; well, since the last time I read the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the anti-Syrian opposition movement has been called the Cedar revolution, a reference to the Lebanese national tree, it has also been called the BMW revolution. Today's demonstration included far more women with covered heads and men in traditional dress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right:&nbsp; the people who want Syria out are wealthy, evil bastards just waiting to exploit the poor, downtrodden, devout Muslims who protested today.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As if anticipating this blog entry, the NYT has already changed its headline on My Way, but not the position.&nbsp; The Hezbollah Rally and 300-Meter Free Style Granade Wrestling Championship (fun for all!) is still the TOP STORY, as far as the Grey Lady's concerned.&nbsp; But Hezbollah's name now appears in the title.</p>
<p>The people who write for the New York Times hate freedom and democracy as much as Osama bin Laden does.&nbsp; Every bit as much.&nbsp; They may prefer the Stalin model to the Khomeinei model, but they want absolute power in the hands of their political allies.&nbsp; You can almost hear them yelling, "*** Freedom" in the headline.&nbsp; You can see the relative meaninglessness of our own president, as his major speech is in seventh (7th) place on their top 10 list, behind such world-changing stories as a bill tightening banckruptcy law nears passage.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Were this a different era, and men were still men and still settled things in manly ways, I'd invite any writer or editor employed by the NYT to St. Louis for a boxing match.&nbsp; Maybe a dual.&nbsp; But these are gentler times.&nbsp; Only terrorists settle disputes with fists and bullets anymore.&nbsp; And the New York Times loves terrorists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, the blogosphere knows what's real.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/003905.html">Matt Margolis </a>covers Bush's speech on the Middle East, as does <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6419">Steven Taylor</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9533">Outside the Beltway </a>examines a Zogby poll on opinions in Lebanon.&nbsp; And I give you links to <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/03/07/1318.aspx">McCain's Hypocrisy</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/004019.php"> Captain's Quarters </a>notes that Syria, bolstered by the New York Times endorsement, is reinstating its puppet prime minister.&nbsp; Expect violence.</p>
