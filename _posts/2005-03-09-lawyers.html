<p><em>Some of my favorite bloggers are lawyers, but this is too good to pass up. </em></p>
<p>A big, burly guy in a plaid, flannel shirt and dirty jeans walk into a C.J. Muggs--a pretentious bar in Clayton, Missouri where lots of lawyers hang out after the courts close.&nbsp; The big guy orders a Busch and a shot of tequila, which downs in a loud, rude gulp.&nbsp; He slams the shot glass on the bar startling the suits around him.</p>
<p>"All lawyers are assholes,"&nbsp; he shouts, laughing at his own joke.</p>
<p>For their part, the business people and attorneys try to ignore the guy.&nbsp; But a few minutes later, he downs another shot and announce, again,</p>
<p>"If you're a lawyer, you're an asshole.&nbsp; Hahahahahah!"</p>
<p>A little guy, no more than five-foot-three, thin, with sparse, white hair and almost transparent skin rises from the end of the bar and makes his way around to the loud visitor.&nbsp; The little guy in the gray suit taps the redneck on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm afraid you've gone too far.&nbsp; I&nbsp;<em>demand</em> that&nbsp;you to apologize and take back what you said about lawyers being assholes."</p>
<p>The big guy laughs, takes a swig of his beer, and looks sideways as the his little challenger.</p>
<p>"You a lawyer?" the big guy asks.</p>
<p>"No.&nbsp; I'm an asshole."&nbsp; </p>
