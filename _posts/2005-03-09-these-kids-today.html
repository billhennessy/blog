<p>Back in the early 90s (and isn't that frightening?)&nbsp; I was doing something like blogging in Groton, Connecticut, for Town Hall on CompuServe--pre-Web days.&nbsp; One of the topics of the day was Generation X.&nbsp; People like Rush Limbaugh and others got a kick out of making fun of Xers.&nbsp; They were slackers who wanted to make $45.00 an hour flipping burgers.&nbsp; Or, better, they wanted to graduate from college and step into an eighty grand a year job with a company car.&nbsp; They didn't want to pay their dues.</p>
<p>I lost all of my old columns, but I wrote one that defended the generation.&nbsp; I was at the end of a nine-year hitch in submarines.&nbsp; Every day, I saw a new class of officers or enlisted guys come through Squadron Two on their way to the USS Pittsburgh or USS Dallas.&nbsp; While some of the older guys shook their heads mockingly at the "soft, stupid" kids who couldn't hold a candle their generation, I saw something different but not dramatic.&nbsp; I saw a mix of people who looked a lot like the mix of guys I went through sub school with.&nbsp; My guess both groups were a lot like the mix who went through sub school with Pug Henry's son in "The Winds of War."&nbsp; </p>
<p>While there were slackers in the GenXers, there were slackers in the 1942 classes, too.&nbsp; Just ask my dad.&nbsp; In World War II as today, twenty percent of the people did eighty percent of the work.&nbsp; That's just the way it is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By 1999, those "slackers" became known as the dotcom billionaires.&nbsp; As some in older generations complained about them, Generation X provided the energy and enthusiasm for the technology revolution that drove the economy from 1994 to 1999.&nbsp; One might blame them for the bubble, but the old, rich guys greedy to make paper profits off the kids' hard work were the ones over-valuing bad ideas.&nbsp; Can you really blame the 23-year-old Ivy Leaguer with the bad idea for going public and squandering $300 million that some wealthy old guys gave him?&nbsp; I can't.&nbsp; Old guys with lots of money are supposed to show wisdom.&nbsp; They're supposed to protect the economy and the free market from bad ideas written on good, Ivy League paper.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, Generation X is in that netherworld of their 30s.&nbsp; They don't yet control the media--they're too young.&nbsp; They no longer attract the attention of business or news or television because they're too old.&nbsp; They're in the same boat I was when I observed them in 1993:&nbsp; they're poised to take over the world. </p>
<p>There's a new generation out there.&nbsp; They're in high school or college.&nbsp; They read; they blog.&nbsp; They watch television.&nbsp; They pay a lot of attention to those of us&nbsp;from previous generations:&nbsp; boomers, Xers, and whatever it was that followed.&nbsp; Their generation hasn't been named, so far as I know. Perhaps the Hip-Hop generation would fit.&nbsp; (You figure out why.)</p>
<p>If you're my age or a little older or a little younger, avoid the temptation to complain about these kids.&nbsp; As a lot, they're no better or worse than our generations.&nbsp; Like our classes, 20 percent do 80 percent of the good, and 5 percent to 95 percent of the bad.&nbsp; They look up to us (God knows why) and expect something that many prior generations didn't give succeeding generations:&nbsp; a little respect.&nbsp; It' funny, isn't it?&nbsp; In 1997 people were handing their retirement funds over to kids they called slackers, hoping the kids would turn $100,000 into a $100,000,000.&nbsp; But the investors and lenders didn't respect the kids.&nbsp; You wonder where the bubble came from?&nbsp; (It's hard to cheat an honest man.)</p>
<p>When I stroll through my blogroll, I see links to blogs like <a href="http://rightintx.blogspot.com/">Right in Texas </a>and the <a href="http://www.thepoliticalteen.net/">Political Teen</a>.&nbsp; I'm so proud of these kids.&nbsp; They write and think beyond their years.&nbsp; But not really.&nbsp; They just think beyond my years when I was seventeen and sneaking beer out of my dads stash in the basement.&nbsp; They share their ambitions with us.&nbsp; With luck, we will follow their lives on line as they graduate from college, begin law school or medical school, or simply get a job.&nbsp; We'll read about them meeting someone special and falling in love.&nbsp; Like Tiger Woods, they'll disappear for a time while love and family takes the lion's share of their time and energy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I never thought about the generation I belonged in.&nbsp; I was almost too young to be a boomer and too old for Generation X.&nbsp; I am far from the best representative of my class, but I'm far from the bottom, too.&nbsp; Still, I had plenty of older folks telling me that anyone my age was self-serving punk who'd never amount to squat.&nbsp; "You kids have it too easy," they said.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And they were right.&nbsp; We did.&nbsp; Compared to almost any other people in any other country at any given time, though, every generation of Americans had it too easy.&nbsp; Alexis de Tocqueville noticed it at the beginning of the 19th century.&nbsp; That's why America is what it is:&nbsp; we've got it easy, and we work our butts off to keep it that way.</p>
<p>These kids today understand that.&nbsp; They want the torch, but they want to be ready for it.&nbsp;They want to make America and the world better, just as we did, just as my mom and dad and aunts and uncles did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kids are alright.&nbsp; Teach them well, and they'll make the world a better place to live.&nbsp; </p>
