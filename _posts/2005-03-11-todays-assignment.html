<p>Visit Donegal Express.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.donegalexpress.net/2005-03-09/not-only-a-blog-but-typoed-hard-alochol">The Donegal Express &raquo; Not only a blog, but a typoed hard alcohol!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There are several reasons to go visit Bill Hennessy&rsquo;s excellent blog. I could go on about the depth and quality of writing he puts up, making us all fortunate for its existence. I could talk about the wisdom that seeps through your screen as you read. But I&rsquo;m not going to do that. I&rsquo;ll give you one good reason to go visit.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">There&rsquo;s a bit of irony in this.&nbsp; Just Tuesday night, I began writing a blog entry about Donegal Express, which I found quite accidentally a few weeks ago.&nbsp; The writing is crisp and happy, always, almost like an Irish drinking song. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I missed my window. Any accolades now will smack of reciprocation.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">Still, I can honestly say &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; and let you know I am humbled.&nbsp; </p>
