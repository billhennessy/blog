<p>This must disappoint the left:</p>
<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=519&amp;ncid=718&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20050311/ap_on_re_us/judge_bodies">Yahoo! News - DNA Evidence Found in Judge Killings Case</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A DNA match from a cigarette butt convinced police that a Chicago electrician was the killer of a federal judge's husband and mother, authorities said. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a week, the leftist press typed its stories with crossed fingers that some white supremist hate group murdered the judges family.&nbsp; Instead, it was a run of the mill, disgruntled plaintiff.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My heart goes out to the judge who must feel more alone than I could imagine.&nbsp; This sap who committed the atrocities and then took his own life failed to come to grips the beauty of life.&nbsp; In his suicide, he denied society the opportunity to inflict justicewhich is too bad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.themoderatevoice.com/posts/1110553383.shtml">Joe Gandelman </a>has more.&nbsp; (BTW, which is the preferred?&nbsp; Supremist or Supremacist?)</p>
