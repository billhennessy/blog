<p>It&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Week&mdash;every Irishman&rsquo;s favorite seven days.</p>
<p>Today, the people who wish they were Irish held a parade in Downtown St. Louis.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t go, of course, because I attend the annual Ancient Order of Hibernian&rsquo;s Dogtown Parade on the 17th.</p>
<p>The Hennessys meet at West Park and Tamm. Stop by if you&rsquo;re about.&nbsp; After the parade, we're making the trek to Ellisville for Matt and Angie Clancy's fantastic Corned Beef and Cabbage.&nbsp; If you need a place for the Reinforcin' o the Stereotypes, and you don't want live close to Soulard or Dogtown, Clancy's has the best St. Pat's party in West County.&nbsp; </p>

<p>After that, it's on to the world famous Hennessy St. Patrick's Celebration at my Uncle Jim and Aunt Eileen's.&nbsp; It's invite only, so I can't give out the address.&nbsp; This party is about 35 years in the running.&nbsp; Uncle Jim pumps out sing-along songs on the player piano, accompanied by a trombone and any other instruments people happen to bring.&nbsp; In the garage, the younger crowd smokes and drinks and laughs and breaks, occasionally, into song.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Hennessy St. Pat's party is special.&nbsp; This time every year, I thank God I'm Irish and a Hennessy.&nbsp; Come Thursday, there's not a better combination on the planet, but I wouldn't turn down the winning Power Ball numbers, either.</p>
<p>Oh, and Hennessy&rsquo;s View has declare this Thursday, March 17, an official holiday.&nbsp; You may skip work so long as you use the time wisely. </p>
