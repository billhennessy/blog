<p>In 1992, I started a little company to produce and sell political t-shirts, sweatshirts, and bumperstickers.&nbsp; It remained at break even too long, so I folded.&nbsp; (Some of you might have our best-seller:&nbsp; I Got Wet When Clinton Soaked the Rich.)&nbsp; I never bought anyone else's stuff because I've always thought my ideas were better.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Along comes <a href="http://www.thoseshirts.com/">ThoseShirts.com</a>.&nbsp; I'm wearing this one right now:</p>

<p>My son, Patrick, has one on the way.&nbsp; As soon as he saw mine, he had to have.&nbsp; </p>
