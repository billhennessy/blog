<p>In an increasingly famous interview, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described herself as a &ldquo;mildly pro-choice Republican.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the pro-abortion folks would have to describe her as anti-abortion.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>"And prayer is very important to me and a belief that if you ask for it, you will be guided. Now, that doesn't mean that I think that God will tell me what to do on, you know, the Iran nuclear problem. </em></p>
<p>Overall, I found nothing in her comments that would stop me from supporting her candidacy.&nbsp; In fact, the interview made her more impressive.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the real deal, comfortable in her own skin, willing to state her views on matters that can sink or float a candidate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The bandwagon deck seems more accessible all the time. </p>
