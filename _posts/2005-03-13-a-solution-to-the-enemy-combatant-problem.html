<p>Michelle Malkin points to a story of a released terrorist killed by the US Army in Afghanistan.&nbsp; With the EU, the Red Cross, the UN, and the Democrat Party so concerned about the treatment of people who wish to kill and eat their children, maybe we have a win-win opportunity here.</p>
<p>Why not put the detainees on a plane and fly them to Baghdad.&nbsp; Oh, while we&rsquo;re at it, let&rsquo;s implant tracking devices so we know where they are.&nbsp; As soon as they pick up a weapon or converse with known enemies or discuss terrorism, we take them out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>No need to be secretive about it, either.&nbsp; Let everyone know that being within 100 feet of these people carries a high risk of silent death from above.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We kill the terrorists, track the ones who may have reformed, and empty out Guantanamo Bay all in one shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like it. </p>

<p><em>Abdullah Mehsud, one of 10 enemy combatants released from Guantanamo Bay who had returned to his terrorist ways abroad, reportedly died this week of wounds sustained in a gun battle with Army forces. After his release from U.S. custody, he went back to Pakistan and became a celebrity for kidnapping two Chinese civilians. (Simon World has background.)</em></p>
