<p>European Union investigators are trying to pin the disappearance of Muslim terrorists on the CIA., according to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7164399/">this story on MSNBC</a>.</p>
<p>What of it?&nbsp; Suppose the CIA is abducting terrorists like Abu Omar and secreting them off to Kuwait or Egypt or Saudi Arabia?&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; Would Italy prefer to harbor these monsters indefinitely?&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is a war against the kinds people who consider mere torture sport.&nbsp; If the abduction and aggressive interrogation of one sicko Muslim radical reveals enough information to thwart a future attack, the practice justifies itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; (And for my liberal buddies, please don't interpret:&nbsp; I mean to say that, in this case, the end justifies the means.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile,<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001767.htm"> Michelle Malkin </a>finds that the people EU wants to protect from the CIA have posted instructions for building a hydrogen bomb on the internet.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9609">Outside the Beltway </a>discusses alleged Israeli plans for taking out Iran's nukes.&nbsp; Good for Israel.</p>
<p>Am I too harsh on the EU?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.donegalexpress.net/2005-03-11/and-the-poor-doomed-the-young-and-the-silly-the-honest-the-weak-the-italians-theyre-doomed-theyre-lost-theyre-helpless-theyre-somebody-elses-meal-theyre-like-pigs-in-the-wilderness-dr-hunter-s-thompso/">Maybe this is an Italian thing</a>.</p>
