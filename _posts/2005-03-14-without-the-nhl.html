<p>My hockey jones finally crested, today, so I took the boys to a <a href="http://www.riverotters.com/">Missouri River Otters </a>game.&nbsp; The Otters play in the UHL.&nbsp; With the NHL lockout in its 438th week, four Blues player--Bryce Salvador, Jamal Mayers, Ryan Johnson, and former NHL Rookie of the Year Barrett Jackman--now play for the local minor league team.&nbsp; (Yes, seeing some of my favorite Bluenotes made my decision to see a game easier.)&nbsp; We saw an excellent game, as the<a href="http://www.riverotters.com/news_dtl.php?QnArticleID=122"> Otters defeated the Port Huron Beacons 5-2</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img alt="Johnson%20204" src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/Johnson_2520204_small1.jpg" align="left" /><a href="http://www.riverotters.com/uploads/audio_videos/3-6-05%20Littlejohn%201-1%20at%20PH.mp3"></a> The opponents, Port Huron Beacons, scored first, driving a rebound past Otters' goalie Jason Tapp.&nbsp; But the home team stormed back.&nbsp; But Otter stars Mark Odut and Frank Littlejohn (who has a great, old fashioned NHL name) scored two goals apiece to put the game out of reach by the end of the second period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game was fantastic for us old-timers.&nbsp; There were four fights, including one class-A ass pounding by Blues star Barrett Jackman against the Beacon's tough guy, Harris.&nbsp; Jackman earned a game misconduct in the fight for losing his elbow pads, a serious offense, apparently, in the UHL.</p>
<p>It was step-son Jordan's first live hockey game of any kind.&nbsp; He's seven.&nbsp; Of course, I had to get him an official River Otters hockey puck to commemorate the occasion.&nbsp; Benjamin and Patrick enjoyed the game.&nbsp; Jordan was truly lost in the magic of professional hockey for the first period.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you're a hockey fan who cannot fathom March and April without black rubber on frozen water, get to UHL game soon.&nbsp; If you're in St. Louis, you better see an Otter game soon.&nbsp; 4,342 fans paid to see today's game--the first for Mayers and Salvador.&nbsp; With four popular Bluenotes in the line-up, expect tickets to the <a href="http://www.riverotters.com/schedule.php">10,000 seat arena </a>to go quickly.</p>
