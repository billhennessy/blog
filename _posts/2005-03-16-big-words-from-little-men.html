<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7193614/">MSNBC - Reid threatens partial Senate shutdown</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If Republicans want to go down this road, they are going to be beginning a huge, partisan, cataclysmic event, the implications of which are so profound that none of us really know the answer to it,&rdquo; said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., one of the Democrats arrayed behind Reid on the Capitol steps. &ldquo;It would mean the government could not function, which, more importantly, means we could not be doing the people&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The Democrats are basically threatening to blow up the world, eat dead babies, and marry their sisters if the Republicans change the rules of the Senate. (Well, they&rsquo;ll probably marry their sisters one way or the other.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Steven Taylor and others have already documented the absurdity of the Democrat position so thoroughly as to render any additional comment redundent.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">So why, if their position is absurd, do they pursuit?&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">Because most Americans&mdash;I&rsquo;d say sixty percent&mdash;have absolutely no understanding of history, justice, freedom, or government.&nbsp; To these ignorant masses, rhetoric is king.&nbsp; They believe whatever they want to believe.&nbsp; They based the concepts of right and wrong exclusively on personal sentiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they feel like killing, they should be allowed to kill.&nbsp; If executing a 17&ndash;year-old multi-murderer hurts their feelings, no state should be allowed to execute same.&nbsp; If the sky turns cloudy at their Memorial Day picnic, it&rsquo;s their neighbor&rsquo;s fault;&nbsp; he should be forced to pay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reid, Baucus, and the rest are gambling that their rhetoric will influence enough friendly morons to demand action.&nbsp; Who knows what action that might be&mdash;one can assume from Senator Baucus&rsquo;s words that they will attempt to incite violence.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">Go for it, dudes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Supreme Court has, in the past year and a half, tossed aside any pretence of respect for the rule of law or democratic processes.&nbsp; Five members, sometimes six, lead the pack of the ignorant I refer to.&nbsp; They dictate law to the people based purely on their private convictions.&nbsp; They know that their convictions will fail in the arena of public debate, so they usurp anti-Constitutional power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The GOP Senate is trying to right a cataclysmic wrong&mdash;a moral and historical wrong perpetrated or pardoned by every American man and woman who has cast a single Democrat vote in the past 50 years.&nbsp; And today it was the head of this criminal cartel accusing the GOP of wrongdoing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shameful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before Senator Reid, et al, shuts down the Senate, he should talk to Newt Gingrich.&nbsp; The same people who wish to be ruled by whims and fancies prefer faceless enemies, like Congress, to likable human being, like Bill Clinton and George Bush.&nbsp; When 37 men go to war with the President while American soldiers fight and die in far off lands, those 37 men better brace themselves for a counter attack that will shake the foundations of the their lives. </p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
