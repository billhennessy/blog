<p>Today before the United States House of Representatives, former major league baseball player and one-time single season home run champion Mark McGwire disgraced himself, his profession, and his career.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img alt="McGwire" src="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/McGwire_small.jpg" align="left" />Under friendly questioning from William Clay Jr., (D-MO), McGwire repeatedly refused to say if he'd ever taken even andro, which he more or less bragged about using when he was a Cardinal.</p>
<p>Clearly, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,150710,00.html">McGwire</a> was a heavy steroid user.&nbsp; I didn't believe so just two weeks ago, but he looked as guilty as OJ today.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have a stack of special edition St. Louis Post-Dispatch papers that announced his breaking of Roger Maris's single season home run record.&nbsp; I'll keep them.&nbsp; They are part of the history of my favorite baseball team.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But my memories of that fantastic 1998 season are tainted, now, and they can't be cleaned.&nbsp;Mark McGwire, a hero to my kids and millions of others, disgraced himself, his sport, his family, and his team.&nbsp; I forgive him, but I'll never respect him again. </p>
<p>At least he didn't lie--this time. </p>
<p>Money quote:&nbsp; When asked if he&rsquo;d support Olympic drug testing standards, McGwire responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is takes so that we don&rsquo;t have any more things like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a loser.&nbsp; </p>
