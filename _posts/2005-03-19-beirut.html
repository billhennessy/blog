  content: I saw tonight in the observatory, through Alvan Clark's telescope, the
    Dumb-Bell nebula in the Fox and Geese Constellation... I have rarely been so much
    gratified... Of all tools, an observatory is the most sublime... What is so good
    in a college as an observatory? The sublime attaches to the door and to the first
    stair as you ascend; - that this is the road to the stars. Every fixture and instrument
    in the building, every nail and pin, has a direct reference to the Milky Way,
    the fixed stars, and the nebulae, and we leave ... the Americas and history at
    the door when we come in.

<blockquote>
<p>BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb has ripped through a predominantly Christian area of Beirut early Saturday, sheering off part of a multi-story office building and raising concerns about more violence in the volatile Lebanese capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Some people hate peace.&nbsp; Tonight, some of them detonated a car bomb in Beirut.&nbsp; Likely, the goal is to divide Christians from Muslims.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">For the life of me, I don&rsquo;t get these people.&nbsp; Why is peace so shameful, so dangerous?&nbsp; How defective a mind it must take to equate with &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;&nbsp;Lebanese independence wrought by the peaceful withdrawal of Syrian occupation forces.</p>
