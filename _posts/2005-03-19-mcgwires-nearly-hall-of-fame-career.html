<p>Heres a telling quote from St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports columnist <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/ncaatournament/story/EA855A22C2CFFE3B86256FC700658130?OpenDocument">Bernie Miklasz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McGwire was such a disappointment. He showed no guts. If he isnt going to take a stand and defend himself against steroids accusations in such a highly publicized and open setting, then I no longer feel compelled to give him the benefit of the doubt on this issue. And <b>Tony La Russa</b> and others who have defended McGwire with such vigor are being made to look like fools. Mighty Big Mac struck out, big time, on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p>(Memo to self: do not vote for McGwire when he becomes eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each major league city has two sports writers with a Hall of Fame vote.&nbsp; When one of your home town guys votes no, youre sunk.&nbsp; Mark <a href="http://www.hennessysview.com/?p=6">McGwire </a>wont make the Hall of Fame, unless the Old-Timers committee is still around after McGwire dies from complications of steroid abuse.</p>
<p>Pete Rose is barred from the Hall because of his conduct AFTER his playing days.&nbsp; Mark McGwires set recordsnoble, towering recordsby cheating.&nbsp; His actions damaged the integrity of the game over a critical 8 year stretch.&nbsp; For that, he deserves a place in baseball history along side the Black Sox.&nbsp; </p>

<p>UPDATE:  <a href="http://unclejacks.blogspot.com/2005/03/say-goodbye-to-hall.html">Uncle Jack</a> sees McGwire's hall of fame hopes disappearing. </p>
