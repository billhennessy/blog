<p><span>In the battle over <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001804.htm">Terri Schiavo</a>, I have found but one pertinent argument</span></p>
<p><span></span><span><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006442">OpinionJournal - Peggy Noonan</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>There is a passionate, highly motivated and sincere group of voters and activists who care deeply about whether Terri Schiavo is allowed to live. Their reasoning, ultimately, is this: <em><span>Be on the side of life. </span></em>They remind me of what Winston Churchill said once when he became home secretary in charge of England's prisons. He was seated at dinner with a jabbery lady who said that if she were ever given a life sentence she'd rather die than serve it. He reared back. No, he said, always choose life! "Death's the only thing you can't get out of!"</span><em><span> </span></em><span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>No surprise.&nbsp; Peggy Noonan is something of America&rsquo;s conscience.&nbsp; She shoots the gaps in every argument she enjoins, finding the missing pieces that make the reader say, &ldquo;oh, of course.&nbsp; How could I have been so stupid.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>In the Terri Schiavo case, I sat on my hands until today.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sordid affair in which motives seem to override all other matters.&nbsp; Such is the problem with money.</span></p>
<p><span>The money in this case is a $1 million settlement from a malpractice suit over Schiavo&rsquo;s medical treatment which missed a diagnosis that would have prevented her cardiac arrest.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Michael Schiavo, Terri&rsquo;s husband who has fought to kill her by starvation, has a serious relationship with another woman.&nbsp; He could have divorced Terri and married this woman, with whom he has children, long ago.&nbsp; But the $1 million settlement belongs to Terri and passes to her next of kin.&nbsp; Divorce would sever Michael&rsquo;s relationship, thus passing the million to Terri&rsquo;s parents and brother.&nbsp; Perhaps King Solomon would propose killing Terri so long as Michael surrenders the $1 million to her parents and brother.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, one might reasonably assume that Terri&rsquo;s parents, who have fought to keep her alive by means of forced feeding, have ulterior motives as well.&nbsp; First, there&rsquo;s the million dollars.&nbsp; Second, not all pro-life organizations&nbsp; (and I apologize in advance for this) display a lack of altruism in their advocacy.&nbsp; Terri&rsquo;s parents may be influenced, even in their honest grief, by these organizations.</span></p>
<p><span>The third motive often discussed belongs to the victim.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would Terri want?&rdquo; has been the battle cry of the starvation side for years.&nbsp; Obviously, Terri&rsquo;s motives would be pure.</span></p>
<p><span>What I haven&rsquo;t read anywhere, even in Ms. Noonan&rsquo;s excellent column, is an attempt to drive to the truth absent corruptible motives.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>We cannot know any person&rsquo;s motives in this case.&nbsp; Even if they tell us, we don&rsquo;t know they are being honest even with themselves.&nbsp; Absent motive, we are left to deal with the facts, which are these.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Terri Schiavo, while dependent upon artificial feeding, is not brain dead.&nbsp; She breathes on her own.&nbsp; She controls her muscles on her own. Her heart beats under the command of her own brain.&nbsp; </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Brain death has long been the standard for stopping life support.&nbsp; Except in a few states, doctors must provide all means necessary to sustain life whenever the patient&rsquo;s brain functions.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>The <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/004111.php">US Supreme Court </a>having rejected the case without comment, there are no judicial appeals left.</span> </li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Only by <a href="http://www.blogsforterri.com/archives/2005/03/bobby_schindler_2.php">passing a law exempting </a>itself from judicial review can Terri&rsquo;s life be saved.&nbsp; (And there probably isn&rsquo;t time.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Where does this leave us?&nbsp; Well, frankly, it leaves us with nowhere to turn . . . but to God.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;What would Terri want?&rdquo; has always been the wrong question.&nbsp; Legally, perhaps, it&rsquo;s salient, but morally it&rsquo;s irrelevant.&nbsp; Unable to act upon her wants, Terri Schiavo no longer gets a vote.&nbsp; The correct question, then, becomes, &ldquo;What does God want?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Fortunately for us, the one being whose motives and desires we can know are God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He gave them to us and codified them.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>I must stop here.&nbsp; I am not a theologian, just a curious sinner.&nbsp; But in the search for God&rsquo;s will on the Terri Schiavo case, I would make two points:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Terri Schiavo&rsquo;s existence will not end when her soul leaves her body.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Terri&rsquo;s reward awaits her; eternity for those who are fighting to save her or to kill her is held in abeyance pending, among other things, how they handle Terri&rsquo;s life. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Feminists have always challenged the idea that married women have no rights of their own," said Heaton. "A husband should not be granted absolute control over his wife&rsquo;s fate, especially a disaffected husband with dubious motives."</p>
