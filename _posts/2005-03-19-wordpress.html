  content: "Thanks, Man.  But I had very little to do with this look.  It's a freely
    distributed WordPress theme.\n\nBTW, I am SO happy with WP.  I can't believe I
    wasted so much time trying to get CommunityServer to work.  .NET is a fantastic
    platform, and it's a shame that no one has built a good blogging tool with it.
    \ If I had time, I'd take the lead.  "

    Microsoft is all fine and dandy for playing video games, but not for..you know..doing stuff.

    And remember what the Bible says:

    The angels speak the language of UNIX.

    You can look it up!

    Well, I'm still a Microsoft guzzler.  Having gone through the Sun/Oracle/Java world after HP TurboImage/COBOL/Gupta worlds, I realized that fun toys for engineers tend to make terrible investments for companies.

  content: "BUT . . .  WordPress rules, too.  PHP reminds me of old ASP Classic.  I'd
    much rather work with real classes in C#, but no one seems eager to start a really
    good .NET blog application.   With so many free ones out there, I understand why.\n\nWhat
    I don't understand is why the CommunityServer people are so determined to create
    the world's greatest discussion forum tool instead of the best blog.  Seems to
    me that forums are soooo 2003.  "

<p>As you can probably tell from the drastic change to my layout, I am switching from <a href="http://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/03/20/1417.aspx">CommunityServer </a>(which you probably know as .Text) to WordPress. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I am&nbsp; a Microsoft Kool-Aid guzzler.&nbsp; As such, I have tried to keep my blog 100% .Net.&nbsp; I worked through the betas and release candidates for CommunityServer.&nbsp; I really wanted to make it work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hennessysview.com/wp-trackback.php?p=19">Unfortunately</a>, the current version of .Text is not ready for prime time.&nbsp; Trackbacks don&rsquo;t work most of the time.&nbsp; While the tool might be fine in a heterogeneous .Text world, most of the blogosphere uses other tools.</p>
<p>I chose WordPress because of the wide ranging themes and the ease of configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The switch over is pretty easy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost my comments, at least temporarily, but I&rsquo;m trying to do some sql magic to restore them.&nbsp; Please be patient.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Links from other sites will probably take you to the old site.&nbsp; I will leave that up until I find a way to redirect those links to the appropriate post on the WordPress blog.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience. </p>
