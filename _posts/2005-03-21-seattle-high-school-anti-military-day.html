    I don't get it...if you don't live in Seattle and therefore are not a taxpayer in that area, what business is it yours to tell them what to do?  If you don't live there then shut up.

    Is there a video of this BTW?  Because I'd think it'd be real funny to see the "Marine's" face when he walked in the room--I'd pay like $3 to see that, maybe even $4.

    Does anyone even read this blog?

    like to see the look on your face when you run into that Marine--or me--in a bar.

    MICHAEL McFARLAND--Are you asking me out?  Don't ask, don't tell.

    I don't read this blog, came across it via track back on Malkin's site.

    Maybe I don't deserve to live here..but what are you going to do about it?  Communism is for whimps who need a nanny State.

    I CAN TYPE IN ALL CAPS TOO!!!  SEMPER FI!  I LOVE IT.

<p>A fine Marine has written a letter complaining of his treatment at a Seattle High School "Hate the US Military Day." (That's not what they called it, but that's what it was. <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001821.htm">Michelle Malkin </a>links to <a href="http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/004019.html">the letter on SoundPolitics</a>which includes e-mail addresses of this un-American school board. Please read the letter. The addresses are right here. </p>

<p>UPDATE: Here's my first e-mail these folks:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have read with interest the story of the sickening, un-American, anti-troop demonstration one of your high schools recently perpetrated. When I learned today that US Marine was invited to this affair in order to be ridiculed and lied about by brainless teachers and idiot students, I had to act. I demand an apology to service members of every branch and every war from each member of the school board and each faculty member of West Seattle High School. I will post that apology, with signatures, on my web site. Until I receive that apology, I will encourage each of my 4,000 readers to send each of you a daily e-mail demanding same.</p></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:  March 22 e-mail to the school board and West Seattle High School's principal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Folks,</p>
<p>I continue to hear from military veterans who are sickened by your political ambush the US Marine Major last week.  I hope you are hearing from them, as well.</p>
<p>I hope you will take this opportunity to denounce the travesty that occured in your schools last week so that we who have worn this great nation's uniform can move on.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>William T. Hennessy</p>
<p>Please read the comments.  The US Marine Corps isn't happy.</p>
