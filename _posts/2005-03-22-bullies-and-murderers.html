<p>In Minnesota, a wierd kid who (supposedly) got picked on a lot decided to avenge himself by killing lots of people, including his grandparents.</p>
<p>I think, not so much of the killer, but of the other kids, even the bullies.  Yesterday, they had plans.  Today, they have wings.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hegstrom described the shooter grinning and waving at a student his gun was pointed at, then swiveling to shoot someone else. "I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that's when I hid," she told The Pioneer. (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151085,00.html">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>So does this kid become  tree for killing himself?  Is he boiling in oil?  These multiple, mortal sin types hadn't evolved in Dante's day.</p>
<p>In the death camp that America has become, what do we really expect?</p>
<p><em>Eternal rest grant unto them, o Lord, and let the perpetual light shine upon them.  May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.  Amen.</em></p>
