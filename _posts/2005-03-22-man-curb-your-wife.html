    In all the controversy over Terri Schiavo, the termination of little Sun Hudson has attracted almost no attention. The bottom line of the termination of poor little Sun's life seems to have been the cost of keeping him alive. This child, born with a terminal condition, was put to death against the wishes of his mother under the terms of the Texas "Futile Care Law." This act, which authorizes health care institutions to terminate life support for patients who have no chance of getting better, even against the wishes of their family, even if they are conscious, was written with the assistance of National and Texas Right to Life and the Hemlock Society and signed by Governor George W. Bush!

    It would be nice if the tremendous coalition of Christian activists and bloggers that has come together for Terri could turn their attention to this unconscionable act of state terror.

    Sid,

    Thank you for pointing this out.  Actually, Michelle Malkin has discussed the Texas issue on her blog.  I have not yet studied the matter, but I intend to.  I am not aware that anyone is currently dying in Texas as a result of that law, though Ms. Schiavo's life is the balance.  I will turn my attention to that matter when the Schiavo case is resolved.

    If you know of anyone whose life is in danger in any other state, please feel free to bring it to my attention at once.

    Yours,
    Bill Hennessy

    Excellent post. People should also know that "Terri's wishes' are based on a casual conversation she had with her husband, in which she said (allegedly commenting on "some programs" they were watching on television (transcript of Michael Schiavo's September 2004 Larry King interview:

    KING: How old was she [Terri] when this happened?

    SCHIAVO: Twenty-five.

    KING: A 25-year-old said that to you, if I die, if I'm in this state -- most 25-year-olds wouldn't think of something like that.

    SCHIAVO: It was a comment from watching certain programs. She said -- we were watching some programs, and she said, I don't want to -- I don't want anything artificial like that. I don't want any tubes. Don't let me live like that. I don't want to be a burden to anybody. She's also made comments to other people about different stories.

    This hearsay from Michael Schiavo (corroborated bt statements from Michael's brother and that brother's wife) is what people are referring to every time they mention 'what Terri wanted.'

    Terri's friends and family disputed that allegation, some of whom said she was very upset with Karen Quilnlan was taken off of *real* life support (not just a feeding tube). The judge would accept their staements as credible.

    Your point about the constant questioning of Terri's ability to 'recover', 'improve', or 'get better' is right on the money. Terri is basically mentally handicapped as a result of a brain injury. The value of the lives of the mentally handicapped are not based on whether or not they can 'improve'.

    I'm linking this post.

    <strong>Judge Will Not Order Feeding Tube Reinserted</strong>

    News comes this morning that the federal judge overseeing Terri Schiavo's misnamed "Right to Die" case will not order the feeding tube reinserted, citing that Terri's family in all likelihood cannot successfully prove that Terri's due process righ...

    Bill,

    The document I cited was less than two years old and included the direct observations of the Guardian ad litem.  Did you actually read the report?  While I am not an advocate for either side, I do object to the idea that you think any who aren't convinced that she should be prolonged in her life fall in the mode of thought of the <i>Slingblade</i> quote you started your post with.

    I do not know the motivations of this nurse which you cite, but there are some problems with her statements.  For one, if Terri could say and do all these things, do you not think that they would have been easily captured on the 4.5 hour videotape used in the trial?  Or, for that matter, that at other times additional evidence could have been garnered to corroborate this view?  Indeed, the GAL that wrote the report I cited had more than sufficient chance to observe such behavior.

    One thing is certain:  it is possible that there has been more than adequate observation in this case.  That can be true and one can want the tube re-inserted.   However, any substantial research into the topic does not bear out the idea that she is in a position to be rehabilitated.  The evidence shows that for over four years dramatic attempts were made to do just that and they failed.

    further, you note the following:

    <i>Experts are quoted, many of whom never spent an hour with the patient.</i>

    To whom and what are you referring?

    Further, if this nurses's statements are accurate, how do you account for the following:<blockquote>In the month during which the GAL conducted research, interviews and compiled information, he sought to visit with Theresa as often as possible, sometimes daily, and sometimes, more than once each day. During that time, the GAL was not able to independently determine that there were consistent, repetitive, intentional, reproducible interactive and aware activities. When Theresa

    Steven,

    I've made the point repeatedly that whether or not she can be rehabilitated is irrelevent.  If she can do the things the nurse claims, then she isn't a candid for death by dehydration.  There are spina bifida patients with the abilities the nurse described.  We do not kill them.

    Why were those things not captured in the film?  I don't know.  I imagine they are very rare.  But if once in the past 15 years she uttered the word "mom" or "pain" she is protected by the 14th Amendment.

    It's really not that complex.

    Oh, and the Sling Blade reference is was literary hyperbole. Not to be funny, but to make a strong point.  I'm sorry if it offended--I understand how it could.

    Yours,
    Bill

    \ Much of the 2-year-old document was based on 11-year-old medical documentation.
    \ The GAL did not spend as much time with Terri as her nurses did.  He couldn't
    have,of course, but he didn't.  The nurses have complained that they were not
    listed to.  As I point out in my Experts post, I understand this phenomenon.  It's
    like when someone tells me that entering 2 and 2 into one of my programs returns

  content: "Bill,\n\nIt seems that your position really is simply that she should
    be kept alive--and that is it no more complicated than that.  And that is a fully
    legitimate position to take.  However, if that is your position then really the
    issue of documentioan, Iyer, the GAL and so forth are irrelevant.\n\nI simply
    have a hard time believing Iyer, because there is no other evidence to support
    her claims.  If Terri could do any of those things it would have made it to court.\n\nFor
    example, if one looks at a Court ruloing in 2002, you have the following:<blockquote>Dr.
    Hammesfahr testified that he felt that he was able to get Terry Schiavo to\n        reproduce
    repeatedly to his commands. However, by the court's count, he gave 105\n        commands
    to Terry Schiavo and, at his direction, Mrs. Schindler gave an additional 6\n
    \       commands. Again, by the court's count, he asked her 61 questions and Mrs.
    Schindler,\n        at his direction, asked her an additional 11 questions. The
    court saw few actions\n        that could be considered responsive to either those
    commands or those questions. The\n        videographer focused on her hands when
    Dr. Hammesfahr was asking her to squeeze.\n        While Dr. Hammesfahr testified
    that she squeezed his finger on command, the video\n        would not appear to
    support that and his reaction on the video likewise would not appear to support
    that testimony.</blockquote>\n\nNow, Hamesfahr was one of Schindler's experts
    and the videotape in question was made to help the Schindler's case.  If this
    is the best they could do, then I find Iyer's statements to be highly quesitonable.

<p>There's not much to say.  Judges have determined, in logical order, the following:</p>
<p>A.  Michael Schiavo is Terri Schiavo's husband; therefore,<br />
B.  Michael Schiavo is Terri's legal guardian; therefore,<br />
C.  Michael Schiavo's desires trump laws of the state and of morality.</p>
<p>Florida law does not permit the execution of a person in Terri Schiavo's condition. The judges (like Glenn Reynolds and James Joyner and others) are too cowardly to come out and say, "Look, people, the mentally ill make us kind of sick.  Like Dwight Yoakam said in Sling Blade, 'You know <em>re</em>tards and midgets make we physically ill, Linda.  I ain't sayin' it's right; it's just the way I am.'" So the judges return to an earlier day when men were expected to discipline their wives.</p>
<p>Terri Schiavo had the poor judgement to lose signficant mental capacity.  Obviously, that pissed off her husband.  He's simply exercising his rights as master of the house.</p>
<p>Why didn't I see this before?</p>
<p>Seriously, this is a sad day for justice in America.  The 14th Amendment no longer applies to the mentally ill.<br />

<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001825.htm">Michelle Malkin</a>, as usual, has more, including a link that diminishes hopes for an appeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://bamapachyderm.com/archives/2005/03/21/hammesfahr-terri-could-be-fed-orally-if-allowed/">Beth offers more convincing evidence </a>that Terri could be fed orally, inceasing the possibility of federal murder charges against Judge Greer and Michael Schiavo should Terri die. Beth, the fountain of information that she is, also informs us that the Florida Senate is only three votes from saving Terri's life:</p>
<blockquote><p>We just need THREE state Senators to change their minds and vote with us to save Terri Schiavo</p></blockquote>
