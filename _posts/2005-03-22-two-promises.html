<p>First, barring something really earth-shattering in the Terri Schiavo case, I will not blog about that issue tomorrow.</p>
<p>Second,  I will now drink a Diet Coke, watch the rest of Letterman, and climb into bed beside the most wonderful woman in the world.</p>
<p>Please remember:  As disturbing as the Schiavo case may be, the world goes on.  There are democracies to grow in the Middle East and children to <del datetime="2005-03-23T08:23:2606:00">education </del> educate in the United States.   There is a wonderful, beautiful world all around us, and it's filled with wonderful people--even those who disagree with me.</p>
<p>I am so thankful for everyone I've met through this wonderful medium.  You're all named on the blogroll or my private address book.  How glorious it is to meet good, intelligent, argumentative, bullheaded, kind, loving people all over the world!</p>
