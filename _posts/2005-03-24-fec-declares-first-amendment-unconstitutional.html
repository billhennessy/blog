<p>Taking its lead from the Supreme Court, which has recently ruled that the Constitution is un-Constitutional if the European Union says so, the Federal Election Commission, today, declare the First Amendment, while protecting displaying a crucifix in a jar of urine, does not apply to political speech.</p>
<p>Think I'm joking?  I'm not.  (See <a href="polipundit.com/index.php?p=6945">PoliPundit </a>and <a href="littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=15184_Proposed_FEC_Rules_for_Internet_Speech&amp;only=yes">LGF</a>)  If the FEC's proposed rules are adopted, Americans will have to clear their e-mails and blogs with the KGB--that is, the FEC--prior to sending.  This is a way to prevent the common people from getting mixed up in politics, leaving the field clear for John McCain's political action committees to solicit funds from cable television companies.</p>
<p>You see, even Senators don't make very much money.  If The People start picking our leaders, men like John McCain will have to learn to live on the $170,000 his government job pays.  But if you outlaw political speech, he can collect hundreds of thousands from big business by channelling it through the 527 organizations his legislation created.</p>
<p>Write the <a href="mailto:internet@fec.gov">FEC </a>and tell them what you think of their objective of one-lining the First Amendment</p>
