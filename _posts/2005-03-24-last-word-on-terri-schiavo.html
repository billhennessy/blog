    I think that it truly is sad that the doctors and our judicial system have decided to allow a young woman to die.  The thing that I keep thinking about is the fact that she does not have a disease or a medical condition that will cause her death (as things stand) but that it is throught the willingness of doctors and judges to step back and literally let her starve to death.  Our judicial system cried foul when we first heard of the abuses at the Iraqi prison or at Guatanamo Bay. How is this any different?  Is this not a form of torture?

    I also am worried that the legal system has allowed a very eery precedent to take place.  Any person who happens to become disabled to some extent and not able to verbalize their own wishes can be eliminated just because someone says that that is not the way they would have chosen to live.  What about our elderly generation who may suffer from Alzheimers or other dimentia-related diseases.  Surely they would not want to live that way so what is the harm in just eliminating them just as is happening to Terri?  Yes, I think that the judicial system will one day look upon their lack of guts in this case and regret it.

    How many lives could be lost because of this case?

    Only time will tell....

<p>Judge Greer having denied Governor Jeb Bush's petition to make Terri Schiavo a ward of the state, the Schindlers seem to be out of legal and political options.</p>
<p>Terri's life is in God's hands.  In truth, it always has been.</p>
<p>Those who have fought valiently to save Ms. Schiavo must take pride in having fought a good fight.  Whatever Michael Schiavo's motives may have been, and whatever the motives of those who took his side, we are best to assume their intentions noble absent evidence to the contrary.  (Many on the left, I suspect, want her to die only to deprive their political enemies, particularly the faithful, a victory.)</p>
<p>Likewise, I hope those who disagree with us will attribute high motives to our fight.  (Even still, there are those among  us who may have only wanted to advance a personal agendum.)</p>
<p>In the end, Terri Schiavo will live on in her true home.  As I said two nights ago, this world has plenty of unfinished work to keep us occupied.  If God's will drove Brian Nichols to Ashley Smith's apartment, we must trust that He will do right by Terri Schiavo.</p>

It's too bad the judge has banned the recording of the details of Terri's final days.  In these matters, it's best not have any witnesses.</p>
