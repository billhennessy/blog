<p>My daughter died of complications from childhood diabetes more than 10 years ago.  At the time, I was warned that diabetes research charities are not very interested in finding a cure.  That would put them out of business.  Moreover, JDRF seems to prefer people dying to giving up its political bent on stem-cells:</p>
<blockquote><p>SCIENCE DID publish the study demonstrating that adult spleen stem cells completely cured mice with late stage juv. diabetes. Despite this amazing success, the JDRF DID refuse to fund human trials. -- Wesley Smith, medical ethicist </p></blockquote>

<p>Michelle, thanks for bringing our attention to this issue.</p>
