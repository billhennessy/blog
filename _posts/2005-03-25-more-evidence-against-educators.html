(Sorry-- left out the NYC when I originally posted.)</p>
<p>From the "you can't this stuff up" pile:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Bronx teacher who repeatedly flunked his state certification exam paid a formerly homeless man with a developmental disorder $2 to take the test for him, authorities said yesterday.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it gets better.  What made authorities suspicious was that the homeless guy scored so much higher than the teacher ever scored they knew something was amiss.</p>
<p>The homeless guy:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I gave him my all," said Leitner, 58, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a disorder similar to autism. "He gave me what he thought I was worth."</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow.  Wow, wow. wow.  My opinion--the kids in New York would be better off with the Asperger's guy teaching them.</p>
