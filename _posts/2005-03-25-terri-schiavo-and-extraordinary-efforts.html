<p>I have to agree with<a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/004157.php"> Ed Morrissey </a>on this:  Governor Bush has done all he can do, and he must not violate the law to save Terri Schiavo.</p>
<p>That might sound callous, but staying within the law is now our last refuge.  As Thomas More told Will Roper in Robert Bolt's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;keyword=0679728228&amp;index=books">A Man for All Seasons</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast -- man's laws, not God's -- and if you cut them down -- and you're just the man to do it -- d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake. </p></blockquote>
<p>This page has argued for the Congress, the President, and the Governor to make extraordinary efforts to prevent the murder by dehydration of a mentally damaged human being.  I believe all parties have made that effort and have done so within the law.  I further believe that Judge Greer has operated outside the law.   But blatantly violating the court's order in this case will neither save Terri's life nor fix the extra-Constitutional judiciary that has grown up in America over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Take More's advice, now, and hide in the thickets of the law.  Let the Devil look for us there where Daniel Webster can defend us.</p>
