<p>When I started writing in 1993, I assumed that at some point I would do it for a living.  I did for a short time in 1995, but it was a pretty meager living.  In 1999, I wrote a little ASP application that would allow me to write a few columns a week at my leisure.  Soon, I found myself a single father, though, and had no time to write.</p>
<p>Last year the world overflowed with both beauty and ugliness.  I could not hold my tongue--or my keyboard--any longer.  Blogging seemed to be the perfect medium for me, so I jumped in.</p>
<p>As problems mounted, so did my hours at the keyboard.  Those hours, though, come from a fixed allotment of time and something else had to give.  What gave were those multitudinous little commitments that we implicitly made to the most important people in our lives:  wives and kids.</p>
<p>Were there some return, other than various satisfactions, in blogging, I would not be writing this.  There are not.  As with so many things, blogging is a numbers game.  I drive up my readership only by increasing my hours.  The writing isn't as time consuming as the linking.</p>
<p>First things coming first, the three hours a day I've devoted to this work will now go into other, private endeavors.  If time permits, I may post a single column-length piece each week. I will no longer maintain a running blog.</p>
<p>I must thank the people who have been most generous and enjoyable:  Michelle of<a href="http://rightintx.blogspot.com"> Right in Texas</a>, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com">Michelle Malkin</a>, Beth of <a href="http://bamapachyderm.com">My Vast Right Wing Conspiracy</a>, Steven Taylor of <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com">Poliblog</a>, <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/">Captain Ed</a>, James Joyner of <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com">OTB</a>, Jim Paine at <a href="http://www.pirateballerina.com/index.php">PirateBallerina</a>, <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com">Dean Esmay</a>, <a href="http://themoderatevoice.com/">Joe Gandelman</a>, <a href="http://collegepundit.blogspot.com">CollegePundit</a>, Political Teen, <a href="http://www.gopbloggers.com">GOP Bloggers </a>and <a href="http://www.blogsforbush.com">Blogs for Bush</a>, <a href="http://www.blogsforterri.com">Blogs for Terri</a>, and all the others.</p>
