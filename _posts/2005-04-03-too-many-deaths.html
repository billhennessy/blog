<p>I planned to write  a column-length piece today.  I even mapped out an outline:  Terri Schiavo, Jesse Jackson, the Colorado Supreme Court.</p>
<p><img src='/wp-content/POPE.sff_DCHG102_20050402134805.jpg' alt='John Paul II ' align='left' vspace='4' hspace='5' /></p>
<p>Then the Pope died.</p>
<p>I sat here for a couple of hours trying to think of something to write.  I thought of much.  Unfortunately, none of the things would interest readers.</p>
<p>There's been too much death lately.  Minnesota, Terri Schiavo, little girls in Nebraska and Florida, the Pope, even Johnnie Cochran.</p>
<p>I'm going to church tomorrow to pray to God that the Holy Spirit moves the College of Cardinals to select a new Pope who can do as much for the world as John Paul II did.  That won't be easy, but it's important.  The culture of life should be his theme.  While JPII concentrated on changing governments, the next Pope must go micro and change men's hearts.</p>
