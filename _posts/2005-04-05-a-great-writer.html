<p>A few years back (quite a few), I picked up a copy of Esquire at an airport news stand.  I think I was in Charleston, but it might have been Atlanta.  It was hot.   The issue contained the best American short stories of the year--judged by whom, I do not know.</p>
<p>Whoever they were, they got one right.</p>
<p>I wish I remembered the story or the name of the Saul Bellow entry.  I do not.  It was a fantastic story that I read twice on the flight to St. Louis.  I read it first, because Bellow's was the most recognizable name.  I read it last to make sure that the Bellow story was really that much  better than all the others combined.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>Whether it's testimony to my thick-headedness or to Saul Bellow's excellent writing, I have no idea what his politics were.  I don't care.  It doesn't matter.  I know that he was a friend to the author of the 1980s classic, "The Closing of the American Mind."  I know that, like Hunter S. Thompson, he knew which keys to hit.  I know that in his 70s he wrote a better short story than the hungry, over-educated English majors who were runners-up in Esquire's 1988 contest.  (I think it was 1988.)  I know life on earth is better because Saul Bellow wrote about it.</p>
<p>If you've never read anything by Bellow, pick up "Herzog."  It'll be worth your time and money.</p>
<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I decided to learn more about the man whose writing I have so enjoyed.  I learned that Saul Bellow was a liberal who made the mistake of giving a speech 3 degrees off from the liberal dogma of the day in San Francisco in 1968.  He was heckled and booed off the stage.  According to his semi-official website, he retreated into a "neo-conservative reactionary."</p>
<p>Perhaps I like Bellow for the same reason I like John Dos Passos, Whittiker Chambers, and T. S. Elliot--liberals or communists who, having deigned to think for themselves on some trivial matter, met the hatred of liberalism.  They didn't then "become" conservatives--they became honest unto themselves.</p>
<p>Liberalism is doctrinaire and hate-filled.  Everything else is considered conservatism.</p>
<p>I choose everything else.  So did Mr. Bellow.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/200504a.htm#ln4">Complete Review </a>has links to other obits and promises more, which I look forward to reading.</p>
<p><a href="http://kirklea.blogspot.com/2005/04/saul-bellow-ripthe-great-bellow-dead.html">Chris Holmes</a> has personal reflections.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizzy-liz.blogspot.com/2005/04/rest-in-peace-mr-bellow.html">Lizzy Lizzard Lips</a> admits she's not supposed to care about Bellow, but does.</p>
