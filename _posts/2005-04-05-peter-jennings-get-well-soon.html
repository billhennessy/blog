<p>Politics used to end at the water's edge.  Now it ends at the treatment room.</p>
<p>Peter Jennings announced today that he has lung cancer--the deadliest cancer of them all.</p>
<p>Many who read this blog detest Jennings's politics, as do I.  But Peter Jennings's life hasn't been all roses.  When Don Imus made fun of his marital situation a few years ago, I couldn't laugh.  Perhaps Imus had never loved.  Or perhaps he'd been spared the pain of a love that blinded him to the treachery of the object of his affection.  It's a hurt that you don't get over.</p>
<p>I wish Mr. Jennings all the best in his fight against death.</p>
