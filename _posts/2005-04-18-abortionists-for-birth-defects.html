<p>In Illinois, quickly becoming the most leftist state in the union, Planned Parenthood and other infanticide supporters, are pushing a bill through the state's legislature that will make it more difficult for pregnant women to obtain ultrasounds, according to the <em><a href="http://www.illinoisleader.com/news/newsview.asp?c=24417">Illinois Leader </a></em>via <a href="http://jacklewis.net/weblog/archives/2005/04/hiding_the_trut.php">Jack Lewis</a>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because seeing a picture of an unborn child tends to turn women against whimsical murder--the chief form of amusement for Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002114.htm">Michelle Malkin </a>quotes <a href="http://junkyardblog.net/archives/week_2005_04_10.html#004216">Bryan Preston</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's hard to see an ultrasound and remain pro-choice. Once you see that your potentially aborted wad of tissues has fingers, toes, eyes and a nose and all the rest it becomes a person in your mind, and that makes you less likely to become one of Margaret Sanger's company's customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an old Soviet trick to win over the hearts and minds of non-believers.  You remember, don't you, when the Kremlin, faced with widespread and persistent toilet paper shortages, outlawed toilet paper?</p>
<p>Since Blagojevich became Illinois's governor, the state has gone berserk in pursuit of the Culture of Death.  Recently, Blagohevich <a href="http://www.ifrl.org/press_releases/050414/">signed an emergency bill </a>that specifically violates numerous state laws in order to force Catholic pharmacists to assist in abortions.  The <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.asp?Page=/Culture/archive/200504/CUL20050414b.html">pharmacists </a>have sued to stop him.  <a href="http://www.ifrl.org/alert/regen/">Illinois </a>is also pushing to fund embryonic stem and tissue research.</p>
<p>(All of this <a href="http://www.hennessysview.com/?p=680">inspired a little parody </a>of an old Tom Lehrer parody.  )</p>
<p>If you care about the health of children, oppose this legislation by contacting the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/">Illinois General Assembly</a>.</p>
