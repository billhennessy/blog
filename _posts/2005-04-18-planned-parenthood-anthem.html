<p>All the world seems in tune<br />
On a spring afternoon<br />
As we murder a fetus in the womb.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll do-in<br />
A newborn to two-when<br />
We murder a fetus in the womb.</p>
<p>We'll slaughter them all amid<br />
Laughter and merriment<br />
Except for the few<br />
We take home to experiment.</p>
<p>Yes, the sun's shining bright,<br />
Everything seems alright<br />
As we murder a fetus in the womb.</p>
<p>We've gained notoriety<br />
And caused much anxiety<br />
In the Vitae Society<br />
With our games.</p>
<p>They call it "Impiety"<br />
And "lack of propriety"<br />
And quite a variety<br />
Of unpleasant names.</p>
<p>But it's protected by Corpus Habeae<br />
To want to dispose of a ba-bay.</p>
<p>So if Sunday you're free<br />
Why donÂ’t you come with me<br />
And we'll slaughter a baby in the womb.</p>
<p>We'll chop it with rotors<br />
And flip off the voters<br />
When we murder a baby in the womb.</p>
<p>When mom sees an ultrasound<br />
She thinks it's infanticide<br />
But with new legislation<br />
Her worries will soon subside.</p>
<p>Yes, we're cheering the law<br />
As we suck out its jaw<br />
After killing a baby in the womb.</p>
