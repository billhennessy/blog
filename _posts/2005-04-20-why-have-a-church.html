<p>Liberal Catholics in America want a church that promotes contraception, abortion, homosexuality, promiscuity, greed, lust, dishonesty, sloth, and the rest of the mortal sins.</p>
<p>So, why have a church?</p>
<p>How indicative of our selfishness, our vainglory, to ask our churches to read the Bible then teach the opposite.  Isn't that what the devil is for?</p>
<p>That nut case<a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2005_04_17_dish_archive.html#111392970504770935"> Andrew Sullivan </a>yesterday, already roundly destroyed by <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2005/04/andrew_sullivan.html">Professor Bainbridge</a>, threw a tantrum that deserved a slap in the face and a prolonged sentence in the timeout chair.  Like a petulant child, Sullivan rejects the possibility that 5,000 years of Judeo-Christian tradition is right and he alone is wrong.  In his egomaniacal drive to be a god on earth, Sullivan spews vile epithets at Pope Benedict XVI.  He echoes the radical hatemongers on DemocraticUnderground who believe Benedict a Nazi, a Hitler youth, a Catholic equivalent of George W. Bush.</p>
<p>While the Catholic church needs members, it needs members who believe in the church.  The last thing this world needs--the last thing God's Kingdom needs--is another "church" that derives its doctrine from CBS sitcoms.  The religion of secular narcissism already serves those who want to immanentize the eschaton.  Christian churches, particularly the Catholic church, has a mission ordained, not by man, but by God.  That mission is to teach men to serve God, to love Him with all our hearts, minds, energy, and souls, and to love our neighbors as ourselves.</p>
<p>If you are Catholic and you believe that the church is standing in the way of your eternal salvation, find a different church.  Take a leap of faith into another denomination since our Church has failed to inspire a leap of faith into it.</p>
<p>MereComments joins in my celebration of <a href="http://merecomments.typepad.com/merecomments/2005/04/the_cafeteria_i.html">the Cafeteria Closing.</a>  Their headline is taken from Maureen Dowd's typical pack of hysterical lies.  (Maureen Dowd is to God what the Surgeon-General is to smoking.)  See how many lies you can count in one Dowd paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>The white smoke yesterday signaled that the Vatican thinks what it needs to bring it into modernity is the oldest pope since the 18th century: Joseph Ratzinger, a 78-year-old hidebound archconservative who ran the office that used to be called the Inquisition and who once belonged to Hitler Youth. For American Catholics - especially women and Democratic pro-choice Catholic pols - the cafeteria is officially closed. After all, Cardinal Ratzinger, nicknamed "God's Rottweiler" and "the Enforcer," helped deny Communion rights to John Kerry and other Catholic politicians in the 2004 election. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/20/opinion/20dowd.html?">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Answer:   Simply count the words.  Every drop of idiotic poison that drips from Ms. Dowd's fingers is a lie.</p>
<p>Thank God the cafeteria of faith closed yesterday.  We can only pray that Sullivan and Dowd are inside when  Benedict XVI welds it shut for good.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://thepublicsquare.blogspot.com/2005/04/peggy-noonan-on-benedict-xvi.html">Catholics in the Public Square </a>for directing me to <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006584">Peggy Noonan's </a>always wonderful writing, this time on Benedict XVI.    Money quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>What to do to help? See his enemies for what they are, and see him for what he is. Read him--he is a writer, a natural communicator of and thinker upon challenging ideas. Listen to him. Consult your internal compass as you listen, and see if it isn't pointing true north.</p></blockquote>
