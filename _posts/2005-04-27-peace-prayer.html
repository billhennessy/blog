<p>Read this four times today.  You, me, the world need the grace promised.</p>
<p>"O Lord, make me an instrument of Thy Peace!<br />
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.<br />
Where there is injury, pardon.<br />
Where there is discord, harmony.<br />
Where there is doubt, faith.<br />
Where there is despair, hope.<br />
Where there is darkness, light.<br />
Where there is sorrow, joy.</p>
<p>Oh Divine Master, grant that I may not<br />
so much seek to be consoled as to console;<br />
to be understood as to understand;<br />
to be loved as to love;<br />
for it is in giving that we receive;<br />
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;<br />
and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life." </p>
