<p><em>"Women are the only realists; their whole object in life is to pit their realism against the extravagant, excessive, and occasionally drunken idealism of men."</em>--G. K. Chesterton</p>
<p>I was never a big fan of daily Mass, mostly because it involved getting up early.  On the occasions I did attend 6:00 or 7:00 AM Mass at The Epiphany of Our Lord, I saw a few nuns, a few people my parents</p>
