<p>A high school in Columbus, GA suspended a 17-year-old student for taking a cell phone call from his mother who is serving our country in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>The confrontation Wednesday began after the 17-year-old junior got a call at lunchtime from his mother, Sgt. 1st Class Monique Bates, who left in January for a one-year tour with the 203rd Forward Support Battalion. (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-05-06-iraq-suspended_x.htm">USAToday</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Spencer High School pats itself on the back for not having the kid arrested.  Yes, they considered calling the cops on him.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that one can find a story on un-Americanism praticed by some educator every day of the week, perhaps we need to overhaul the education industry.  </p>
