<p>Tear a banana from a bunch and show it to someone.  Ask them to identify it.</p>
<p> Thats a banana, theyll say.</p>
<p>Now, peel the banana, hold up the fruit, and ask them what it is.</p>
<p>A banana, theyll say, probably somewhat confused at your obvious questions.</p>
<p>Set aside the fruit and hold up the peel.  Once again, ask them to identify what you hold.</p>
<p>A banana peel.</p>
<p>The banana is a banana without its peel, but the peel is not a banana without its fruit.</p>
<p>When I tried to convince myself that, because of decisions Ive made in my life some non-Roman Catholic church would best suit me, I came to the realization that to join any other Christian denomination would be like calling a fruitless peel a banana.  I might be able to rationalize my belief in the new church, but deep down Id know the fruit is missing.</p>
<p>I dont mean to criticize or ridicule any Protestant or break-away Catholic churches.  They remain parts of the Body of Christ.  The fact that theyve peeled away from the fruit doesnt make them not bananasjust incomplete bananas.</p>
<p>To accept anything other than Roman Catholicism for myself would be to give something less than my all to God and to deny my own beliefs.  While I might be saved in another church, Gods mission for me would be left incomplete.  Eating the banana peel might keep me alive, but it wouldnt satisfy the way the banana would, nor would it taste as sweet.</p>
<p>Now, because the Catholic Church teaches, rightly, that only those in a state of grace may fully partake of her sacraments, until my many errors are adjudicated I will not be in full communion.  Perhaps I never will be. Some might consider this and ask, Wouldnt you be better off to fully engage in a church that overlooks your divorce and other sins rather than partially engage in a church that constantly reminds you of them?</p>
<p>I answer with a question:  Would you rather eat an entire banana peel or only a part of the banana itself?"</p>
<p>I feel compelled to enjoy half a banana rather than its entire peel.  The unconsumed portion will  remind me that I denied myself the whole banana, but with God's mercy and grace, I may someday obtain the rest.</p>
