<p>While reading the links from the Nunsense story on <a href="http://romancatholicblog.com">RomanCatholicBlog</a>, <a href="http://kelidei.typepad.com/journey/">I found this</a>.  I have only skimmed it so far, but it's a good story, well written, timely, and encouraging.</p>
<p>Conversion stories are among the most importat to reinforcing faith.  All of the Epistles, really, were testimony to conversions of Jews, pagans, Greeks, Romans, and others.  We learn so much about our faith from those who came to faith as adults or who returned after being adrift in secular confusion.   </p>
