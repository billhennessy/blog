<p>Rev. Alvin Kimel, an Episcopal priest in Johnstown, PA, has returned to the Holy Mother, thanks be to God.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="http://pontifications.classicalanglican.net/?p=901">his letter to the parish</a>, I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise to attention.  Some months ago, I nearly joined the very church Rev. Kimel is leaving.  Thank you, God, for sparing me that humiliation, though I fully deserve the humiliation I would have felt.</p>
<p>The Anglican catholic church has gone around the bend, and Rev. Kimel says it happened in 2003.  "In the name of an ideology of radical inclusivity, the Episcopal Church has moved significantly away from the apostolic and catholic faith of Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>Like so many mainstream Protestant churches, the Anglican church has placed the opinion of (liberal) man far ahead of the truth of God Almighty.  Like so many lukewarm Christians, the Anglican church as a whole would rather abandon Jesus Christ than to stand up to radical leftists in the Western world.  In losing their God, the Anglicans are also losing their good priests.<br />

As I said, private circumstances almost drove me to an Episcopal church over the past year.  But the Holy Spirit, with the help of an Old Catholic bishop, guided me back to the church where I, and all Chrisitians, belong.  It is the church that Jesus Christ undeniably founded, placing Peter at its head and the apostles as its bishops.   How could I have not seen this?  Well, I hadn't really read the Bible much before I began my search for a church.<br />

As I've written before, doubt is a terrible thing.  Fortunately, doubt has a cure--the Bible, the Doctors and Fathers of the Church, and quick look around confirm for me that the Roman Church is the one, holy, apostolic, Catholic church, founded by Christ, guided by the Holy Spirit, infallible, indefectible, until Christ returns to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>How is it that others cannot see this?  </p>
