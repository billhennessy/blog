<p>My wife is wearing one of my t-shirts--a green one with an Irish pub's logo.  That and a pair of jeans.  She just got up from the couch to give the little guy a bath, stopping on the way through the living room to check on the fish and to pick up something left dropped on the floor by a thoughtless child.</p>
<p>Women spend hours and dollars making themselves up to look like something special.  If only they knew that they couldn't possible look more special, more beautiful, more feminine, or more desirable than when they put on a t-shirt and jeans, make-up absorbed and forgotten, and walk through the house putting little things in place.</p>
<p>If you are a woman, remember how beautiful you are when you wake up.  If you're a man, take a second to notice.  It'll make your day.  </p>
