<p>I don't want to get on a rant against Episcopalians, here, but RomanCatholicBlog and <a href="http://www.expagan.info/blog/?p=123">Ex-Pagan</a> bring us links to a travesty in an Episcopal church that I must point out.</p>
<p>I know some took offence at <a href="http://www.hennessysview.com/?p=708">my original swipe </a>at the Anglican church last week.  I even felt a little writer's remorse, thinking, maybe, I'd been over the top.  But God works, sometimes, in obvious ways.  Aside from tacking a list of 95 Antitheses to their own heads and declaring God dead, I cannot think of surer way than <a href="http://romancatholicblog.typepad.com/roman_catholic_blog/2005/05/and_over_at_the.html">The Clown Eurcharist</a> to demonstrate to the world that one considers his own religion a joke.</p>
<p><img src='/wp-content/plugins/clownmass.gif' alt='Episcopalians Desecrate the Mass' align='left' hspace='10' vspace='10' /></p>
<p>If it makes the Anglicans feel any better, we do, too.  And unless Trinity's bishop metes out draconian punishment for the priests involved in this apostacy, it will be impossible for serious-minded people to mentally divorce the Anglican church and its American sister from the clown images.<br />

For the sake of contrasts, consider that the Roman Catholic church has declared this the year of the Eurcharist.  We are pushing <a href="http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/pea/a2.html">Perpetual Adoration</a> in which someone prays before the exposed Body of Christs each hour of the day, every day, forever.</p>
<p>I there are many, many good Episcopalians who are as embarrassed about this is we are mortified.  Please consider doing as the <a href="http://pontifications.classicalanglican.net/?p=901">Pontificator </a>and returning to your Holy Mother Church.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Some commenting on RomanCatholicBlog points out <a href="http://www.traditioninaction.org/HotTopics/a015htGoldenCalf1.htm">a similar travesty</a> at a California Roman church.  I will try to find out more about this abomination--for instance, whether those responsible were punished.  If not, I will make every effort to see that they are.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stjosephsmen.com/letters/clownmass.htm">StJosephsmen.com</a> has posted names and addresses for complaining to the Vatican.  Please use them.</p>

<p>I can't find an e-mail address for Fr. Brian Joyce, the miscreant who carried out the desecration of the Holy Eucharist, but<a href="http://ctkph.org/enhancement/guestbook/entries.xsl"> here's the parish's Guest Book.</a>  Please join me in giving the parish and its pastor your opinion of clown masses.  </p>
