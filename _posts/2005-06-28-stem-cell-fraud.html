<p><a href="http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory_print.asp?number=58119">Scientists admit</a> that the miracle of embryonic stem-cell cures was oversold.</p>
<blockquote><p>James Thomson, the Wisconsin biologist who was the first to isolate embryonic stem cells, admitted that embryonic stem-cell research was oversold. He said cures from this research may not be available for another 10 or 20 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gee, imagine that:  doctors and scientists lying to us in the pursuit of killing babies.</p>
