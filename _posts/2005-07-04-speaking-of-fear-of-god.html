<p>It's amazing that some people are so afraid of getting sick, of offending someone, of being labelled "intolerant", of being poor, of alienating friends or family, of being unpopular, and other temporal nightmares.  But they aren't afraid of spening eternity burning in the fires of hell.</p>
<p>I pray the Holy spirit descends upon these pitiful souls.  They are truly worthy of our most profound prayers.  I pray for those United Church of Christ leaders who prefer the praise of Satan over the promises of Christ.  </p>
