<p>Atlanta, GA--The<a href="http://www.catholic.org/cathcom/national_story.php?id=15424"> United Church of Christ</a> has endorsed homosexual marriage and demanded that God rewrite the Bible "to reflect modern realities."</p>

We know that God is love, and as such She would want us to have a Bible that makes everyone feel good about herself, regardless of sexual orientation, race, or criminal activity."</p>
