<p>Several St. Louis area colleges and school districts fund a thing called HEC-TV.  Most of the programming involves video tapes of classes.  On Saturday night, though, I happened upon a program call Playback.</p>
<p>The first homemade short featured two freaks, one tall and thin with long hair and a beard, one short and fat with mutton chops and a tie.  They were near a river among trees.  The tall one carried a rifle.  He dropped his pants, stuck the rifle between his legs like a prosthetic penis and pretended to masturbate for the camera.  The story seemed to be a glorification of murder.</p>
<p>Next, a black-and-white short begins with a woman being dragged into an abandon building and raped.  Of course, though, she enjoys it once penetration occurs.</p>
<p>Each of the schools that fund this trash receives tax money.  The Rockwood School District, which is licking its wounds of failure of a bond issue for luxuries like astro-turf for its football fields, spends my tax dollars on this filth.  My 12 and 14 year old sons witnessed the first of the episodes.</p>
<p>I have written to each of the sponsoring schools and to HEC-TV to complain.  In particular, I complained to <a href="larsoncraig@rockwood.k12.mo.us">Dr. Craig Larson</a>, superintendant of Rockwood.  While the universities are a lost cause, I expect better of districts who teach kindergarteners.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  The only "sponsor" of HEC-TV to respond so far has been the chancellor of Washington Univeristy--by far the most prestigious school on the list.  It's very encouraging to think that this gentleman took time on a Sunday morning to respond personally.  </p>
