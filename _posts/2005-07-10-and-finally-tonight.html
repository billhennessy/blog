<p>This quote from <a href="http://www.nealpollack.com/cgi-bin/blog/do.cgi/200306222242/permalink">Neal Pollack </a>is two years old, but I just found it.  I like it so much, I'm blogging it in hopes that no one will ever forget what an idiot Howard Dean is.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's easy to see why people are seduced by Howard Dean. He's well-spoken, handsome, and sensible. He appears to have a strong grasp on most major issues, a willingness to compromise with his opponents, and the gift of not getting flustered by minor annoyances. Yet no more evil person has ever walked this earth. If, by some act of Satan, Howard Dean becomes President, America will get sucked into a vast, fiery void from which it will never recover. It would be like the Clinton Years without all the glitz and scandal. Who wants that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Wonderful.  Thank you, and good night.</p>
