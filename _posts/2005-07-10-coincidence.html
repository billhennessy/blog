<p>Friday night I blogged about the evils of the United Nations in Rwanda and elsewhere.  Today, I blogged about the eugenicist Margaret Sanger.  This afternoon I joined <a href="http://www.prolifeblogs.com/articles/archives/2005/07/unfpa_pitches_a_1.php">ProLifeBlogs</a>.org and tonight, on that blog, I found the thrust of a theory the theological side of my brain has been pondering for some time (though it's not time to expose it just yet):</p>
<p>The UN wants to eliminate poverty by eliminating children.</p>
<blockquote><p>
By eliminating children through abortion, there will be fewer children to become impoverished Â– or so the UN geniuses who thought up the proposal claim. In addition, if families allow fewer children to survive pregnancy, there will be more resources available for the remaining ones, thus ensuring them a better education, the same reasoning proposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>How Soviet.  Let us, instead, eliminate stupidity by eliminating the United Nations.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  A little something for the <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/11277">Beltway Traffic Jam</a>.</p>
