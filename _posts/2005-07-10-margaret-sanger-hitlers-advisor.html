    why do you think this has been suppressed by leftist media?
    are you proposing that romancatholicblog has arduously discovered this nugget of proof that liberals are hiding this "soldier of satan" for fear of animosity?

    just because liberals do not propagate racist creeds such as eugenics does not mean they are suppressing them. should an entire political party be labeled by the views of one person? i don't even understand why she is considered liberal. is it because she supports sterilization or euthanasia of "unfit" persons? because i can assure you that i, among the vast majority of liberals, do not share this view, contrary to whatever distorted illusions you may harbor.

<p>Among the Culture of Death, saying anything bad about the Mother of Modern Murder, Margaret Sanger, is a sacrilege.  But <a href="http://romancatholicblog.typepad.com/roman_catholic_blog/2005/07/margaret_sanger.html">RomanCatholicBlog </a>provides a reprint of an article worth reading.</p>
<p>These are actual writings or words of Sanger, long suppressed by the fawning leftist media in the US.  One of the most telling:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective. Possibly drastic and Spartan methods may be forced upon American society if it continues complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic breeding that has resulted from our stupid, cruel sentimentalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Margaret Sanger was a good soldier for Satan.  Let's stop pretending she was anything else.</p>
<p>Sanger's eugenics was also racist.  According to<a href="http://www.blackgenocide.org/sanger.html"> BlackGenocide.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 At a March 1925 international birth control gathering in New York City, a speaker warned of the menace posed by the "black" and "yellow" peril. The man was not a Nazi or Klansman; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>
 Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as "unfit," a plan she said would be the "salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were "irresponsible and reckless," among whom she included those " whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers." She further contended that "there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped." That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered "unfit" cannot be easily refuted.</p>
<p>While Planned Parenthood's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements, history definitively says otherwise. The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review, which Sanger founded in 1917. She published such articles as "Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics" (June 1920), "The Eugenic Conscience" (February 1921), "The purpose of Eugenics" (December 1924), "Birth Control and Positive Eugenics" (July 1925), "Birth Control: The True Eugenics" (August 1928), and many others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other members of Sanger's group provided the basis for the Nazi's genocide:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The leaders in the German sterilization movement state repeatedly that their legislation was formulated after careful study of the California experiment as reported by Mr. Gosney and Dr. Popenoe. It would have been impossible, they say, to undertake such a venture involving some 1 million people without drawing heavily upon previous experience elsewhere. (<a href="http://www.lifeadvocate.org/1_98/feature.htm">source</a> from <u>Legal and Medical Aspects of Eugenic Sterilization in Germany</u>, American Sociological Review, Marie E. Kopp, 1936:763)</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhpas we need to rewrite our history and biographies of this horrible creature.</p>
<p>It never hurts to read <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/martin.ward/gkc/books/Eugenics.html">G. K. Chesterton's</a> thoughts on anything.  As you might suspect, he opposed eugenics.  In light of the millions of Americans murdered by physician eugenicists under the deceitful title of "choice," perhaps we are too late in discovering this nugget of truth from the Apostle of Common Sense:</p>
<blockquote><p>The wisest thing in the world is to cry out before you are hurt. It is no good to cry out after you are hurt; especially after you are mortally hurt. People talk about the impatience of the populace; but sound historians know that most tyrannies have been possible because men moved too late. It is often essential to resist a tyranny before it exists. It is no answer to say, with a distant optimism, that the scheme is only in the air. A blow from a hatchet can only be parried while it is in the air.</p></blockquote>
<p>In another blog, I wrote of a <a href="http://www.hennessysview.com/?p=751">woman who is blogging the aftermath of her recent abortion,</a> even while the victim's body works its way through the municipal waste system like so much refuse.  How clearly we see, in her laments, Chesterton's hatchet.</p>
