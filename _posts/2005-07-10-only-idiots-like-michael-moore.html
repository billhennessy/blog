<p>Okay, I said it.  I'll say it again, so please have your tape recorders ready:</p>
<p>Everyone who likes Michael Moore is an idiot.  Okay, everyone except the anti-Americans who pretend to be idiots.</p>
<p>This week thanks to Moore's al-Qaida heroes, he looked like a compete moron.  Why?  Because Moore claims terrorism is a red-herring, an invention.  The Twin Towers?  Computer graphics.  If your husband disappeared on 9/11, it's because he ran off with his secretary.  (No one's seen her around, either, have they?)</p>
<p>Don't believe me?</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is no terrorist threat. There is no terrorist threat. Yes, there have been horrific acts, of terrorism and yes there will be horrific acts again. But that does not mean that theres some massive terrorist threat. - Said by Michael Moore at The Power Center in Michigan during the book release for Dude, Wheres My Country?"</p></blockquote>

<p>I suppose, then, Tony Blair doctored up these photos during a break at the G8 meeting<br />
