<p>Regular readers might expect me to rant against the AARP, as I at least monthly.  But this time, their altruism is commendable.</p>
<p>By <a href="http://marlowesshade.blogspot.com/2005/07/aarp-paves-way-for-euthanasia.html">endorsing euthenasia for the elderly,</a> the AARP has admitted that it serves no worthwhile purpose and must be put to sleep.</p>
<p>Certainly, just disbanding would be the moral thing to do.  But if the AARP insists on disbanding by suicide, who am I to get their way?</p>
