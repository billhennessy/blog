<p>There is nothing finer in life on this earth than to have a great advocate in heaven.  I seem to have one in Our Lady.  Never have I have fled to her protection, implored her help, or sought her intercession and was left unaided.</p>
<p>If you don't believe in the ability of saints in heaven to advocate on your behalf, do yourself a favor.  The next time you really need help, especially in your faith or in fighting temptation, give Jesus' mother a chance to help.  Jesus has a special love for His mother's petitions.  Let her present yours to Him as her own.  She will.  And you will receive an answer in accordance with His holy will.</p>
