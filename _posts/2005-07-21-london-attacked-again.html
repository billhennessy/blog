<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8655541/">Another cowardly attack </a>on our closest ally's capital city.</p>
<p>MSNBC reports that Tony Blair has appealed for calm.  That seems superfluous in England where the good people showed such commendable fortitude after the last bombs.</p>
<p>Thanks to God, the human toll was much lower this time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only one person was reported wounded in Thursday's blasts, but Blair said the intention of the attacks must have been to kill. </p></blockquote>
<p>And one of the bombers, this time, may have survived the attack.</p>
<blockquote><p>Police also said an armed police unit had entered University College hospital. Press Association, the British news agency, said they arrived shortly after an injured person was carried in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps they will come away with a live suspect <i>cum</i> convict who will shed light on the terrorist network in England.</p>
<p>Again, as always, our prayers are with our brothers and sisters in England, and we will continue to take pride and lessons from their solid strength.</p>
