<p>The National Cancer Institute funded a Chinese study that links induced abortion to a signficantly increased risk of breast cancer.  But the results were politically incorrect, so the NCI buried the study, according to <a href="http://anniebanno.blogspot.com/2005/07/deep-sixed-2000-china-abortionbreast.html">Purposeful Dreamer</a>.</p>
<p>It appears, now, the NCI is removing all copies of the study from the internet in a Soviet-style attempt to whitewash history.  Still, pdf copies remain, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041031182631/http://www.epiresearch.org/meeting_03/abstractbook.pdf">here is a link to one.</a></p>
<p>(H/T to <a href="http://afterabortion.blogspot.com/2005/07/deep-sixed-2000-china-abortionbreast.html">AfterAbortion</a>.)</p>
<p>Please e-mail NCI and tell them you demand they release this study and warn women that induced abortions increases the risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Here is the<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/contact"> NCI's online e-mail form</a>.</p>
