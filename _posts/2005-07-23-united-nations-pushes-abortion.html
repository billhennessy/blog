<p>The<a href="http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=38577"> United Nations Population Fund </a>as declared that abstinence and contraception do not work in reducing poverty.  Therefore, it declares, a massive increase in abortions is the only way to curb economic privation.</p>
<p>Folks, the United Nations is the largest, most powerful force for evil in the world.  Pressure your political leaders to withdraw from this cancerous legion of death.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Dovetailing perfectly into this story, The <a href="http://www.dawneden.com/2005/07/real-reason-planned-parenthood-calls.html">Dawn Patrol</a>, with the help of commenters, points out that sex education is proven to cause an increase in unplanned pregnancies.  Since the powers that be consider sex education the most important course in public education, the solution they propose to unplanned pregnancy is, of course, slaughtering the unborn, which gives <a href="http://www.hennessysview.com/?p=680">Planned Parenthood </a>supporters great joy.  </p>
