<p>We know that Dick Durbin hates members of the US Armed Forces.  We know that he hates personal property and freedom.  Now we learn how much he hates unborn children.  From <a href="http://proecclesia.blogspot.com/2005/07/durbin-pro-life-stance-would.html">Jay Anderson</a>, via <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/7/24/114739.shtml">NewsMax</a>, via <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">NBC</a>, we learn Durbin considers being pro-life as a disqualifying defect for any judge.</p>
<p>I wonder how many abortions his wife and children account for?  After all, if abortions are such wonderful things, wouldn't he want the women he loves have a few?</p>
