<p>No, really, of course.  <a href="http://romancatholicblog.typepad.com/roman_catholic_blog/2005/07/synoid_of_bisho.html">RomanCatholicBlog </a>tells us at the the next time the Bishops get together, they might, just might, address the problem of horrible, rancid, loud, profane music at Mass.</p>
<p>I'm sure all those who have complained about the music weren't <a href="http://www.hennessysview.com/?p=781">inspired by my blog</a>.  More likely, they were inspired by the same Holy Ghost that inspired me.  </p>
