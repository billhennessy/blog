<p>Thanks to some great investigative work by <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/003100.htm">Michelle Malkin</a>, we have a letter from the Pa. Lt. Gov. Catherine Knoll:</p>
<blockquote><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: July 25, 2005 COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA Office of the Lieutenant Governor Commonwealth News Bureau Room 200, Main Capitol Harrisburg, PA 17120 LT. GOVERNOR CATHERINE BAKER KNOLL LETTER OF APOLOGY HARRISBURG: July 25, 2005<br />
Dear Mrs. Goodrich,</p>
<p>I am writing to further apologize and clarify what happened at the funeral of your beloved husband, Joseph. As a wife and mother, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to lose your spouse so suddenly. As an adored member of your family and one of Pennsylvanias sons serving with soldiers from across the commonwealth, SSGT Joseph Goodrich, is one of this nations heroes.</p>
<p>As I said in my phone message to Rhonda, after I learned through press reports that your family was offended by my attendance, I was incredibly upset. I wanted to assure you once again that my intention was not to add to what must be a tremendously, heartbreaking, difficult period.</p>
<p>The war on terror is an immensely personal conflict for the thousands of people whose families continue to serve with honor, and I have attended dozens of funerals to offer my sympathy and condolences to the families of soldiers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.</p>
<p>My heart and prayers are with your family, and to the families of all the men and women serving the cause of freedom in the fight against terror. I unfortunately, did not arrive at the church services for SSGT Goodrichs funeral in time to offer my personal condolences to you. As I also mentioned on Rhondas phone message, as I do with many Pennsylvanians I meet, I offered my business card so she could contact me, and as a sign of my willingness to help the family through this difficult time in any way I can. To do anything that was deemed insensitive was completely counter to my intent.</p>
<p>Sergeant Goodrichs service was beyond the call of duty. If my regard for his familys grief was seen another way, it is thoroughly regrettable. The fact that you have been offended deserves and receives my most profound apology.</p>
<p>I will continue to support our troops in my role as Lt. Governor and support our President as an American. That I somehow conveyed an impression that was interpreted as other than that will forever be saddening and upsetting to me.</p>
<p>Again, please accept my heartfelt apology and deepest sympathy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Catherine Baker Knoll<br />
Lieutenant Governor</p></blockquote>
<p>Michelle points out that the witch will not hold a press conference or in any way address this subject ever again.  Apparently, Lt. Gov. Knoll will be busy for a few weeks selling building materials to hurricane victims in Florida.</p>
