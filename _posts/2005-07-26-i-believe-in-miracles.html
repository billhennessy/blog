<p>I wish I could give the details, but that would cause problems.  Suffice it to say that two weeks ago, something my wife and I had been praying hard for seemed to have been placed out of reach.  If that was God's answer to our prayers, it was a resounding "Get lost."</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, we didn't stop.  I went straight to the perpetual adoration chapel and knelt before the exposed Body of Christ for an hour and a half.  Then I drove and prayed.  Then I repeated that process.  I finished a novena and dropped the request from my prayers, except for a short daily petition.  The doxology of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy must be applied:  Jesus, I trust  in you.</p>
<p>It now appears that God's "no" was something more like man's delay--a speed bump.  God answered our prayers.  I do not know why, though.  My wife might be an angel, but I am about as worthy as cut golf ball.  I don't deserve His ear, much less His favors.   I can only assume that because I am so wretched and weak, God figures he has something to work with.  Perhaps He likes the challenge.</p>
<p><em>My soul magnifies the Lord,<br />
And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.<br />
For He has regarded the low estate of His handmaiden,<br />
For behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<br />
For He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name. And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.<br />
He has shown strength with His arm:<br />
He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br />
He has put down the mighty from their thrones,<br />
and exalted those of low degree.<br />
He has filled the hungry with good things;<br />
and the rich He has sent empty away.<br />
He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy;<br />
As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to His posterity forever.</em></p>
<p>Not that anyone will ever call me blessed--nor a handmaiden--but I kind of know how Our Lady was feeling when she recited the above to Elizabeth.</p>
