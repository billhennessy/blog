<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Drudge</a>.</p>
<p>Israeli intelligence reports that the large network of al-Qaeda web sites, the organizations primary means of international communication, have been taken out of service.  The Israelis believe UK intelligence did the Lord's work on this case, reports the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20050728-081354-1414r.htm">Times of London</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past fortnight Israeli intelligence agents have noticed something distinctly odd happening on the internet. One by one, Al-QaedaÂ’s affiliated websites have vanished until only a handful remain, write Uzi Mahnaimi and Alex Pell. </p></blockquote>
<p>More power to Tony Blair.  </p>
