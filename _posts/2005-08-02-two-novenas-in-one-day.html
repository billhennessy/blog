<p>That's how important my present petition is.  I said two, one-day novenas today--one to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, one to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal.  (For the non-Catholics, they're both the same person.)</p>
<p>First, I want to publicly thank Our Lady for her gracious intercession.  I know that if my request is not opposed to God's holy Will, it will be done.</p>
<p>Second, just in case, if you happen to be praying for things, please drop my name with the Almighty.  (It makes little difference to me of which denomination you might be.)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the prayers.  </p>
