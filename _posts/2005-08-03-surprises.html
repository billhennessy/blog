<p>Sometimes surprises are less than wonderful.  Does God heap these events on us?  Or does He allow them happen because it's part of His plan?  Or does He allow them to happen because we have it coming?  Or all three?</p>
<p>Somehow I know the Good Lord will see us through.  I wish I could see the path now, though. </p>
