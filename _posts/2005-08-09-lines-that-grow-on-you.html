<p>In the past month, the hand of God has moved in my life so many times in so many wondeful ways.  Over and over, I find myself whispering parts of the Magnificat.  There is one stanza of that prayer that has worked its way into my very DNA:</p>
<p> For He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.</p>
<p>I think that's my new motto.</p>
<p>Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est, et sanctum nomen ejus.</p>
<p>In society's jaded view, I probably have nothing to rejoice about.  But when the Lord our savior does things for us, society's blessing means nothing.</p>
<p>He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.</p>
<p>Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est, et sanctum nomen ejus.</p>
