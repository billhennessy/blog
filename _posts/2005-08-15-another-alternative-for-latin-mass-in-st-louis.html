<p>As readers know, my family treks almost 40 miles most Sundays to attend the Tridentine indult Mass at St. Francis de Sales Oratory in South St. Louis.  I have personally expressed my thanks to his Excellency, Archbishop Raymond Burke, for allowing us this beautiful and holy Mass in such a splendid work of art.<br />

The blessings of Archbishop Burke continue to flow.  In addition to St. Francis de Sales, West St. Louis Countians like us no longer need drive 40 miles to participate in the Mass that served Catholics around the world for 1400 years, until the New Order was promulgated in 1968.</p>
<p>The Priory of the Annunciation on Kehr's Mill Road (at Strecker, just east of Wild Horse Creek) celebrates the Latin Mass in all its pious splendor each week day at 7:00 AM.  On Sundays, the priests of the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem celebrate the same beautiful Mass in the chapel at the Passionist Nuns Convent at 15700 Clayton Road, just east of Clarkson and next door to St. Clare of Assisi.</p>
<p>Catholics in West County who have never experienced the Latin Mass must do so.  You will learn how holy, Christ-centric, and upliftinglinly sacred the Mass can be.    If you read this today, Monday, August 15, please consider attending the 7:00 PM Mass at the Passionionist Nuns' Chapel in celebration of the Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady.</p>
<p>Here is the website of the <a href="http://canonsregular.com/index.html">Canons Regular</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to <a href="http://www.archstl.org/contact.html">thank Archbishop Burke </a>for his continued devotion to the Latin Mass.</p>
