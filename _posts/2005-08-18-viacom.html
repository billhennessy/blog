<p><a href="http://proecclesia.blogspot.com/2005/08/catholic-league-viacom-chief-sumner.html">Jay Anderson </a>illuminates a blood-boiler involving Viacom and Mother Teresa.  (The fact that so many anti-theists so despise a woman who did nothing but good her entire life should tell us a lot about these people.)</p>
<p>Penn and Teller aired a show in which they called Mother Teresa a "f****ing c***t."  The Catholic League protested.  Viacom promised to never air the episode again.</p>
<p>But Viacom's president, Sumner Redstone, wanted the last word.  Mr. Anderson quotes Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Redstone's letter  reeks with arrogance. Showtime, he says, 'frequently airs programs with controversial, differing points of view.' So we are supposed to believe that calling nuns 'f---ing c---s' is just a 'differing point of view.' When he says that 'we as an organization are committed to artistic freedom,' Redstone is being deceitful: CBS is a Viacom holding and CBS refuses to air the reruns of 'Amos and Andy.' </p></blockquote>
<p>I wish entertainment executives would learn that heaven isn't such a bad place and getting there might not be so terrible.  But if it's not their cup of tea, at least they could stop trying to discourage others.</p>
