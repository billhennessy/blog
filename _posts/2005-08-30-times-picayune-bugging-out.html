<hr />
<p>With Lake Pontchartrain continuing to pour into New Orleans, the <a href="http://www.nola.com/newslogs/breakingtp/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_Times-Picayune/archives/2005_08.html#075048">city's major daily newspaper </a>has ordered an evacuation of its building and its reporters.</p>
<p>As of 9:40 AM:</p>
<blockquote><p>Water continues to rise around our building, as it is throughout the region. We want to evaucate our employees and families while we are still able to safely leave our building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon hopes to stop the growing levee burst with sandbags, according to <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge</a>.  Officials plan to drop  3,000 lbs. sandbags from helicopters into the Lake to stem the breech.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nola.com/weblogs/nola/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_nolaview/archives/2005_08.html#075134">Historic French Quarter</a>, which survived the hurricane proper in relatively good shape, is now flooding according to witnesses.  With news media abandoning the city, though, official reports are hard to come by.</p>
