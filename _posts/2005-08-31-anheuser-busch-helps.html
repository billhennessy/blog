<p>A-B Increases Water Donations to 825,000 Cans to Aid Hurricane Katrina Victims</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch Foundation Also Donates $250,000<br />
To the Red Cross Relief Efforts</p>
<p>In response to requests from relief agencies following the tremendous damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, Anheuser-Busch and its wholesalers have now shipped more than 825,000 cans of safe drinking water to victims of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Separately, the Anheuser-Busch Foundation announced today that it is donating $250,000 to Red Cross relief efforts along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Our sympathy goes out to all victims of Hurricane Katrina, and this donation will help those who have been most affected by the storm, said Patrick Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch Companies.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch and its wholesalers are always among the first to lend a hand to those in need, helping them get back on their feet.</p>
<p>The Anheuser-Busch Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc., a St. Louis-based corporation with subsidiaries that include the leading U.S. brewer, one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of aluminum beverage containers and one of the largest theme-park operators in the United States.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch and its charitable foundation have reached out to groups that need them, contributing to community organizations across the country and touching countless individual lives.</p>
<p>Over the past decade the company and the Anheuser-Busch Foundation have donated more than $330 million to charitable organizations, including those that support education, health care, the arts, cultural enrichment, social services and environmental conservation.</p>
