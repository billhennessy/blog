<p>Nearly 300 people have already responded to the <a href="http://katrinahomes.billhennessy.com">Home for Katrina Victims</a> site.  The site has been up only about 15 hours, and it's been working properly only since 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I believe that all love, charity, and kindness comes from God.  But we have free will to pass it along or to use it all on ourselves.  For that matter, we can reject it completely.  Today's response demonstrates the American people, at least many of them, are passing along God's graces in buckets.</p>
<p>This is simply amazing.  As horrible as the conditions may be in our country, our spirit offsets those conditions manifold.</p>
<p>Thank you, all who are helping.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I am heading to church now to pray for you, for them, for me, and for all.</p>
