<p>These are the words for New Orleans Mayor Nagin, according to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,168112,00.html">Fox News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There will be a "total evacuation of the city. We have to. The city will not be functional for two or three months," Nagin said. And he said people would not be allowed back into their homes for at least a month or two.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Thy faithful and kindle in them the fire of Thy love.<br />
Send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created.<br />
And Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
