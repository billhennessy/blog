<p>Some highlights:</p>
<p>It will take "years" to recover from Katrina.<br />
Government allows fuel blends immediately to reduce cost of gasoline.<br />
Victims will be overwhelmed with Americans' desire to help.<br />
I am confident that with time you'll get your life back in order . . . the great city of New Orleans will be back on its feet.</p>
<p>Some Thoughts:</p>
<p>Let's go to a 10 hour per day, 4 day work week.   There is no excuse for people to drive to work 5 days a week at this point, and 10 hour days won't hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Let's encourage Americans to stay within 50 miles of home this Labor Day weekend.  We can visit distant relatives and amusement parks when things stabalize.</p>
<p>Let's find a home for every person who needs one.</p>
<p>Let's overwhelm them with love, mercy, and generosity.</p>
