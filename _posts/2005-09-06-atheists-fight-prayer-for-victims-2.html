<p>Yes, the headline is too absurb to be fiction:</p>
<h2>Atheists: No prayer for disaster victims</h2>
<h3>U.S. group says president violating Constitution by urging pleas to God</h3>
<p>Despite their hatred of religion, the Atheists are strongly admonishing their members to contribute both money and effort to the relief of hurricane stricken areas.</p>
<p>"Anyone who looks upon the destruction, death, and suffering in Louisiana and turns his back risks  . . . getting . . . a really bad reputation  . . . in some circles," said association president Ellen Johnson.  She quickly added, "Not there's anything wrong with that."</p>
<p>Instead of prayers, the American Atheists encourage their members to read debunked, 18th century psuedo-scientific pamphlets on phrenology and eugenics.</p>
