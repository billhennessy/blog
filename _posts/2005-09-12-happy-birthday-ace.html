<p>Few men are lucky to enough to meet one person who fulfills all of their social needs--a beautiful woman whose mere glance flitters the heart, a kind friend whom first you call with news good or bad, a companion in drink and sport with whom to enjoy life's greatest celebrations and deepest  heartbreaks, a mother who tends lovingly the children of the house, and a vessel of God's mercy who shows you His love in her every move.</p>
<p>On this day, I celebrate the great good luck to have met such a woman and married her.  May her joys this day and all the days of her life match the joy she brings to me and the blessing she draws down upon our house.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Ace of Hearts.  You are simply the best.</p>
