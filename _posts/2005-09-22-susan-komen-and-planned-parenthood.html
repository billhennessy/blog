  content: I am a survivor who did not join the race for the cure this year after
    learning my team was sending money to planned parenthood by participating in this
    event.  This was a very emotional decision for me.  Not being a part of the sisterhood
    of survivors today was really hard.  Komen needs to disclose this issue.  Everything
    else is about disclosure and there are other breast cancer foundations we can
    support.  We need cures and we have been misled by the Komen Foundation.

    I found your site while doing research on the Komen Foundation.

    I certainly hope you realize that abortion is only one of many services provided at Planned Parenthood. In fact, the majority of the work performed by that organization has to do with gynecologic and breast health services for low-income women. It is a myth that the only thing Planned Parenthood does is abortion and you should be ashamed for spreading it. Do your research and see for yourself.

<p>When I was a runner, I took part in many runs to support various charities.  One I never joined was the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure.  Not because I oppose breast cancer research, but because something about that particular organization rubbed me the wrong way.  For one thing, it seemed too big, too intrusive.  It was like a charity version of the AFL-CIO, before it collapsed.</p>
<p>(Hat tip to <a href="http://romancatholicblog.typepad.com/roman_catholic_blog/2005/09/susan_komen_bre.html">RomanCatholicBlog</a>)</p>
<p>Last year, I learned that the Susan G. Komen foundation is one of the most expensive non-profits.  In other words, its administrative costs are significantly higher than many charities.  According to <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/4509.htm">Charity Navigator</a>,  the foundation spends about 30 cents of every dollar raised on things other than breast cancer research, detection, and treatment.</p>
<p>From an article in <a href="http://www.osv.com/periodicals/show-article.asp?pid=1061">Our Sunday Visitor</a>, we learn that one of those things is abortion.  In 2003, according to the article, Susan G. Komen Foundation gave $450,000 to Planned Parenthood.  Moreover, Susan G. Komen Foundation's founder, Nancy Brinker, is on the advisory board of Planned Parenthood in Dallas, TX.   In this capacity, she helped funnel some of the Susan G. Komen donations to build a $5 million abortion mill in Dallas.</p>
<p>Now, we know beyond reasonable scientific doubt that induced abortions increase the risk of breast cancer.  Isn't it a little too convenient that Susan G. Komen Foundation, which stands to make more money the more women develop breast cancer, funds an organization that provides services that induce breast cancer?  Imagine if the American Lung Association donated money to the Tobacco Lobby.  It's the same thing.</p>
<p>Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation is not the only charity that pays for abortions.  The YWCA, the March of Dimes, the United Way,  the Girl Scouts, and the American Red Cross also give cash and in-kind donations to Planned Parenthood.  But Susan G. Komen's growth and power, combined with its sinister connections, makes it worth watching and challenging.</p>
<p>From 1999 to 2003, the organization's revenue increased from $42 million to $95.5 million.  At the same time, the organization's expenditures went from $50 million (an operating deficit of $5 million) to $86 million (an operating surplus of more than $9 million).  At the end of 2003, the foundation showed a profit of $2.38 million dollars with net assets of $51 million.  Not bad for a non-profit.</p>
<p>Looking at Charity Navigator's list of similar charities, though, we find more alarming news, especially to anyone concerned with actually finding a cure for breast cancer.  It seems that the breast cancer industry is far more interested in lining its own pockets than in finding a cure or treating patients.  While Susan G.  Komen's overall rating is a disappointing 57.90,  look how she compares to others in the same arena:</p>

<p>Only <a href="http://www.the-rose.org/index_2.html">The Rose </a>seems to be spending money on helping cancer patients instead of fund raising and executive salaries.  Though a much a smaller organization, The Rose actually helps women prevent, detect, and cure breast cancer.  According to Charity Navigator:</p>
<blockquote><p>Founded in 1986, The Rose is Houston area's preeminent breast health care center providing cancer screening, diagnosis and support to all women regardless of their ability to pay. This year, more than 32,000 women will receive services at The Rose. Of this number, 5,300 will receive needed services at no charge through The Rose Empower Her Sponsorship Program. This program provides breast cancer detection services to those who cannot afford the costs of these potentially life saving procedures.</p></blockquote>
<p>While The Rose's CEO earns $92,000 a year, Susan G. Komen's CEO makes a comfortable $225,000.</p>
<p>Clearly, Susan G. Komen foundation is in bed with the devil.  If you're rightly determined to donate money, time, or energy to find a cure for breast cancer, please find a charity that doesn't also cause breast cancer.</p>
