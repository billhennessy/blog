<p>The correlation between liberalism and selfishness is too easy to make.  Atheistic liberalism gives selfishness a whole new dimension.  But liberals, who in their selfishness consider themselves the epitome of compassion, say you can't measure compassion.</p>
<p>I utterly refute that idiot sentiment.  And it is nothing more than mere sentiment.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,176163,00.html">FoxNews.com</a>, we learn that folks in  liberal states spend their money almost exclusively on themselves, while "Bible belt" people  spend money on those who need help.</p>
<blockquote><p>New Englanders remain among the most tightfisted in the country when it comes to charitable giving while Bible Belt residents are among the most generous, according to an annual index. </p></blockquote>
<p>Surprise, surprise.</p>
<p>A modern day Robin Hood would steal from the left and give the poor.</p>
