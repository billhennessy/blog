<p>Today I saw two Veterans for Kerry bumperstickers on my way to work.  I wonder if the people who emblazoned their cars with those stickers are really veterans.  If so, do they consider themselves terrorists?  Their choice for CINC '04 does.</p>
<p>Yesterday on CBS's "Face the Nation," Senator Kerry said</p>
<blockquote><p>And there is no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night, terrorizing kids and children, you know, women, breaking sort of the customs of the--of--the historical customs, religious customs. Whether you like it or not... </p></blockquote>
<p>It's time for Senator Kerry to find a new home in a country that shares his sickening, depraved view of the American Fighting Man.  Try France, John.   It would suit you well--a country full of cowards bending over for the advancing barbarians.</p>
