<p>When your dream team defense includes the pro-Soviet, anti-American Ramsey Clark, you're in deep trouble.  Yesterday, Clark stormed out of the court room in an effort to undermine the trial, US foreign policy, and God Almighty, whom Clark seems to consider an underling.  Today, he apparently advised his Hitleresque client to refuse to return to court.  Saddam also told the judge to "go to hell," according to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com">FoxNews</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where the Constitution and case law stand on this, but it seems fitting that Clark be denied reentry into the United States.   Let him live out his miserable final days in some desolate wasteland before explaining his love of communism to his maker.</p>
