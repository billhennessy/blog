<p>I received an e-mail from NewsMax today about the Disney film &ldquo;Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&rdquo;&nbsp; It contained warnings from variously striped Christians that the movie may not be true to the Christian intentions of C. S. Lewis.</p>

<p>Disney&nbsp;Studios, for sure, has been&nbsp;no friend to Christianity in recent years.&nbsp; The company was among the first to actively promote homosexuality&nbsp;among its employees and&nbsp;park guests.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Still, I remember the lesson of Patton.</p>
<p>The 1970 movie &ldquo;Patton&rdquo; starring George C. Scott was intended as an anti-war film.&nbsp; Scott and&nbsp;the film&rsquo;s&nbsp;producers hoped to capture Patton, the greatest&nbsp;General officer in American military history, as a&nbsp;blood-thirsty murderer.&nbsp; The goal was to vilify a WWII hero, thereby vilifying the military in general.&nbsp;In 1970, though, a film could be only so false.&nbsp; There were more than 200,000 men who served under Patton still alive in 1970.&nbsp; Gross lies would be exposed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The writers and producers believed that Patton&rsquo;s own words, culled from his memoirs compiled into a book called &ldquo;War as I Knew It&rdquo; would be enough to make America hate him and the Army he stood for.</p>
<p>They were wrong.</p>
<p>Instead of becoming a beacon of anti-military leftism, &ldquo;Patton&rdquo; is the darling film of the pro-military right.&nbsp; Patton&rsquo;s true character was too powerfully and sincerely American for a director, writers, and actor to spin.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s Patton turned Americans back toward its beloved Army, not against it.&nbsp; The truth betrayed those who hoped to hijack it.</p>
<p>C. S. Lewis&rsquo;s Chronicles of Narnia, I trust, will survive Disney&rsquo;s attempt to secularized.&nbsp; The Word of God will always overpower attempts as usurpation.&nbsp; Indeed, just as Patton&rsquo;s renown only grew from the movie, Lewis and Christ, Lewis&rsquo;s protagonist, will grow from this film.</p>
<p><!--StartFragment --><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"We believe that God will speak the gospel of Jesus Christ through this film," said Lon Allison, director of Illinois' Billy Graham Center.</font> </p>
<p>While Graham might not like an endorsement from a Catholic, I have to say that if this film is good enough for Billy Graham&rsquo;s folks, it&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
