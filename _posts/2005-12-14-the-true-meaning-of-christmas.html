<p>Thanks to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_12_11_corner-archive.asp#084635">Katherine Lopez at NRO The Corner</a>, I learned a valuable lesson that all Catholics should heed:  The true meaning of Christmas is about increasing the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Let's hope Ted Kennedy's theological insights make to the Vatican before the Pope writes his homily for Midnight Mass.  We'd hate to mis-catechize the Christian world by talking about Jesus when Christmas is really about hourly wages, health insurance, and campaign contributions from unions.</p>
<p>From the Democrat press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and George Miller (D-CA) will stand before the Capitol Christmas Tree on Wednesday to discuss the true meaning of Christmas: hope, generosity, and goodwill toward others. In this spirit, the lawmakers will call on Congress to raise the national minimum wage before leaving for the year. They will release a report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research detailing the difficulty that families living on the minimum wage have in making ends meet. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hallelujah!</p>
