<p>On Monday <a href="http://www.billhennessy.com/?p=7148">I blogged about the ABC News poll </a>of Iraqis that surprised the left by its upbeat results.  Seventy percent of Iraqis are opimistic and better off than a year ago.</p>
<p>Today, Jason on <a href="http://iraqnow.blogspot.com/2005/12/media-surprised-by-success-of-election.html">Countercolumn</a> notices that the media are, once again, surprised--this time because of the success of Iraqi parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Obviously, the press is reading its own press.  We on the right like claim the liberal media intentionally distorts the news to conform to its world view.  If the <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20051215/D8EGS3Q01.html">AP</a>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/PollVault/story?id=1389228">ABC</a>, and <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/12/15/international/middleeast/15cnd-iraq.html?hp&amp;ex=1134709200&amp;en=b137c7afd970c608&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">NYT</a> really are surprised that things in Iraq are much better than they've been reporting, maybe they're not malicious.  Maybe they're really that stupid.</p>
<p>In the end, does it matter? Bush's popularity has returned as pollsters stopped seeding questions, and the Iraqis will soon have a freely elected Parliament.</p>
