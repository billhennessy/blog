<p>Readers of this blog know that I hold for Maureen Dowd the sort of contempt one might have for dog feces packed into the tread of a new sneaker.  It's nothing personal, really.  It's the fact that she is unintelligent, smug, and unfunny, possessing the writing skills of a high school diarist.</p>
<p>With dead tree readership down at the NYT, its publisher has turned to demand payment for the privilege of reading Ms. Dowd's thrice-weekly demonstration of her contemptible ignorance.  Same for Paul Krugman's Economics <font color="red">(101)</font>.</p>
<p>Hallelujiah!</p>
<p>For years, the newspaper of wreckard allowed Dowd's particularly menacing form of mental pornography into our homes in exchange for answers to a few demographics questions.  Now, they limit her damage to only those minds already so polluted with intellectual waste they feel compelled to <i>pay money</i> to read Dowd's insipid columns.</p>
<p>My personal thanks to the NYT publishers for this invaluable gift to the English-speaking world.</p>
