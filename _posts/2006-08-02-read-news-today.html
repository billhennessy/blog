<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063153/http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2006/08/murtha-is-caught-lying-about-his-cold.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a>, quickly becoming the best political blog on the net, reports some very bad news for the Jack Murtha defense squad:&nbsp; Murtha is a liar, according to the United States Marine Corps.</p>
<form action="" method="post">I had class, tonight, after an arduous day at work.&nbsp; I had every intention of going to bed early.&nbsp; I just wanted to check the news of the day.&nbsp; I was too busy even to listen to the radio news.</p>
</form>
<p>&nbsp;I saw the story on&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063153/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/02/haditha.suit/index.html">CNN.com</a>&nbsp;that I&rsquo;d read briefly about on<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063153/http://michellemalkin.com/archives/005653.htm">&nbsp;Michelle Malkin&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;blog last night.&nbsp; A Marine staff seargent is suing pro-terrorist Congressman Jack Murtha for libel.&nbsp; (Jack Murtha could have served his country better by succumbing to wounds on the battlefield in Vietnam.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Murtha said on CNN May 19: &ldquo;There was an IED attack, it killed one Marine, and then they overreacted and killed a number of civilians without anybody firing at them.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one, tiny, rather innocuous example of Murtha&rsquo;s two year record of slamming American troops.&nbsp; But that ugly old sonofabitch had the shrivled balls to release a statement defending himself.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a response to the lawsuit, Murtha said in a written statement &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame the staff sergeant for lashing out. When I spoke up about Haditha, my intention was to draw attention to the horrendous pressure put on our troops in Iraq and to the cover-up of the incident.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>My ass, you stupid bastard!&nbsp; Do you think all of us are as stupid as the people who vote for you?&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a reason why the party map of&nbsp;U.S. counties is 90% red.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more.&nbsp; Thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063153/http://partisantimes.typepad.com/partisan_times/2006/08/marine_corps_st.html">PartisanTimes.com</a>, we have this brilliant Murtha quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the taxi comes up, there&rsquo;s four or five people in it. And they shoot; shoot those four or five people, unarmed. And then they go on a rampage throughout the houses and kill people. One woman . . . was bending over a child pleading for mercy and they shot her in cold blood. . . .&nbsp; And then in addition to that . . . there has to have been a cover-up of this thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope this Marine wins his suit and wins it big.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too bad Murtha&rsquo;s thousands of libelous lies from the House floor can&rsquo;t be used against him.&nbsp; I guess Murtha wants to make sure that today&rsquo;s military veterans get the same shabby treatment his generation received.&nbsp; Too bad a man his age hasn&rsquo;t grown up.&nbsp; And worse, a man of his petulant immaturity gets elected to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Now, go read &ldquo;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063153/http://www.oldwardogs.us/2006/07/semper_i.html">Semper I</a>&rdquo; on Old War Dogs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the best commentary I&rsquo;ve seen on this story.</p>
