<p>We were all sitting in the living room, tonight, when my wife told me that my son had already chipped the veneer on his tooth. She&rsquo;d taken him to the dentist just this afternoon.</p>
<p>I stormed into the kitchen where the 13-year-old boy was getting himself a glass of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell is wrong with you?&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m stupid enough to pay for orthodontics? You can&rsquo;t even keep your five hundred dollar teeth for four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the room, but not before I saw the tears well up and his lip quiver. He plopped down into the leather recliner in the family room. I stormed onto the deck, alone, and leaned against the rail facing the backyard.</p>
<p>I tried to think of all the rights I had to be pissed. Five hundred dollars for two veneers to cover the chunks he&rsquo;d lost on a Razor scooter two years ago. Five hundred dollars I don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>As I stood in the stupefying heat and palpable humidity, self-loathing metastasized from my gut to my eyes like a super-aggressive cancer that moves through a body faster than a bullet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a monster,&rdquo; I muttered under my breath. God heard it, I hope. I hated myself. Still do.</p>
<p>This is a very good kid I&rsquo;d just destroyed. He has hi s faults, but he&rsquo;s the one who appears when I go out to work in the yard on a Saturday. He&rsquo;s the one who changes his Christmas list every year, removing gifts he thinks are too expensive. He&rsquo;s the eternally happy baby who kept me from killing myself after his seven-year-old sister drowned in 1994, a few days before Christmas.</p>
<p>I walked back into house a minute later. The recliner was vacant, but someone was in the kitchen. I looked in. It wasn&rsquo;t him.</p>
<p>I went downstairs, but he wasn&rsquo;t in the lower family room nor the rec room. I continued to the hall to his bedroom. The light was on, and his door was locked.</p>
<p>I knocked, a second and third time, before the lock clicked. He opened the door with his head down to hide his tears and shame. He turned to get away from me, and I can&rsquo;t blame him.</p>
<p>I reached in and grabbed his arm and pulled him to me and hugged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. You didn&rsquo;t deserve that. I know you didn&rsquo;t do that on purpose. You are such a good kid. I&rsquo;m sorry. I just want you to look as good as you can. You&rsquo;re a good looking kid, and I don&rsquo;t want anything to mess it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it was okay. I know it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I hope he gets over this before I do. I don&rsquo;t know if I ever will.</p>
