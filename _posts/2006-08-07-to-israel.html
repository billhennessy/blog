<p>I know from my hit map that I have several regular readers in Israel.&nbsp; I have written a fair amount on my view of the current, and I continue to pray for Israel&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>On a personal note, though, I must share with you the words of Our Lady, Mother of Israel&rsquo;s savior and of mine, when, in her Canticle to her kinswoman, Elizabeth, she said:</p>
<blockquote><p>He has come to the aid of his servant Israel<br />
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br />
the promise he made to our fathers,<br />
to Abraham and his children for ever.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the Catholic church, we find few words of greater comfort.&nbsp; Nor do we find many prayers as forthright as Mary&rsquo;s praise earlier in the Canticle:</p>
<blockquote><p>the Almighty has done great things for me,<br />
and holy is his Name.</p></blockquote>
<p>May the words of Our Lady bring you comfort and remind you, too, that the Lord made a promise to Abraham, and the Lord always keeps his promise.&nbsp; May you, too, find fulfillment of that promise in life, death, and resurrection of his Son.</p>
<p>Dominus vobiscum and shalom.</p>
