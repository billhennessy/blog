<p>Most of my life, Democrats ran Congress . . . the way Hitler ran Germany.&Acirc;  Then in 1995, Newt Gingrich took the gavel.&Acirc;  I had to learn a whole new perspective.&Acirc;  I had to pick and choose what I was for and against, and I had to cut back on the Congress jokes.</p>
<p>The only good thing about the current balance of power, in my book, is that we can safely oppose everything Congress does or tries to do with absolute confidence that our position is the correct one.&Acirc;</p>
