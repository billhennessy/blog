<p>When I revived this blog some months ago, I decided to set Chesterton as my ambition.�  Not to rival him, of course.�  But to embody his jovial, lively spirit.�  To write from his point of view.� </p>
<p>Go back to 1993, when I wrote <u>The Conservative Manifesto:</u>�  my goal was to carry on in the tradition of William F. Buckley Jr.�  After the book, I wrote for the fledgeling Town Hall Forum on CompuServe three times a week from August 1993 to about July 1995.� </p>
<p>Both experiments failed.</p>
<p>The first time around, events in my personal life factored greatly into my decision to put down the pen.�  This time, I have no such excuses.�  This time, I rely on my maturity and standards to guide.� </p>
<p>The problem is this:�  the more closely I examine the world, the more cynical, sarcastic, and angry I become.�  Those terrible traits, then, leech out onto the paper&#8211;or, in this case, the screen.�  When <a href="http://hennessysview.com/blog/2007/01/31/william-m-arkin-rip/#comments">crusader88</a> criticized my vulgar attack on a writer, I stopped to take stock of my writing.�  Crusader88 was right.� </p>
<p>As I said, I wanted to embody Chesterton; I ended up channeling Menken.�  (Read a bio of Menken, and you&#8217;ll know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about.)�  Crusader88 called me on it, rightly so.�  He or she (I think &#8220;she&#8221; from the prose) showed great courage and Christian charity by so doing.�  While my emotional reaction was honest, I should never have put such hateful thoughts to paper, save, perhaps, for a private journal.</p>
<p>Some people can look at the world and rise above it.�  I, clearly, cannot.�  I take the world too personally to write extemporaneoulsy about it, particularly in a blog.�  With the column, I had to come with 750 words on three different topics a week.�  By definition, while all topical to the time&#8217;s events, I had little passion about most of them.�  And writing under the banner of National Review and the Heritage Foundation, I was compelled to keep it sober.�  The blog encourages me to tap out whatever rage happens to overtake me at any moment.�  It&#8217;s <em>too</em> immediate.� </p>
<p>Even considering all of those factors, my decision to discontinue Hennessy&#8217;s View in its present form comes from the answer to this question:�  Am I adding value to my readers&#8217; lives?� </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The internet is peopled with far better writers, far better thinkers who have far more time to blog than I have.�  No one will miss me.� </p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not going away.� </p>
<p>As I said, the discipline of column writing provides a filter of time and filter of content.�  Moreover, writing a set length on a set day of the week allows the writer to rise above his world and the daily panic to look beyond tomorrow&#8217;s headline or the hour&#8217;s Breaking News.� </p>
<p>So what lies ahead for Hennessy&#8217;s View?� </p>
<p>Well, something that I hope will add value.�  One column a week on things I actually do well, and screaming at the world certainly is not� among them.� </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to tune in next Sunday to find out what.� </p>
<p>Thanks, and God bless,</p>
<p>Wil</p>
