<p>The problem with elevating dim-witted self promoters to some contrived position of power, as the Dems are learning, is that they are never satisfied with the seat you give them.&Acirc;  They want the big seat.&Acirc;  They want to call the shots.</p>
<p>Cindy Sheehan, the woman who turned her heroic son's death in Iraq into a national campaign of ego, says she'll run against Nancy Polosi unless the House Speaker introduces articles of impeachment against the President within two weeks:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;"><span><font><font color="black"><span><span> Cindy Sheehan, the soldier's mother who galvanized the anti-war movement, said Sunday that she plans to seek House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat unless she introduces articles of impeachment against President Bush in the next two weeks.</span></span></font></font></span> (<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070708/D8Q8NBDG0.html" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/08/the-impeachment-drive-gains-steam/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a> reports that Democrats used the weekend to push harder for impeachment.&Acirc;  <a href="http://www.whackynation.com/?p=850">WhackNation </a>weighs in looking forward to the fight. </p>
<p>I say good to both. &Acirc; </p>
<p>Cindy Sheehan running against Nancy Pelosi could give the House Speaker some difficulties in 2008, keeping her away from Washington where Democrats do the most damage.</p>
<p>An impeachment battle in Congress can only help the President and the GOP, which is why Nancy and other Dem leaders are running away from the idea with both left feet.&Acirc;  But a concerted push by the idiots like Sheehan who actually run the party could force Pelosi's hand.&Acirc;  </p>
