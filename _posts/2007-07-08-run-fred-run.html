<p><font color="#0099cc"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fred Thompson has turned a frightening but dull election into the most exciting and pivotal campaign since Ronald Reagan cleaned Jimmy Carter&#039;s clock in 1980.&nbsp; If Fred Thompson&#039;s campaign hasn&#039;t electrified you, consult a physician.</em></font></p>
<p><img src="http://socialnet.imwithfred.com/fred2.gif" border="0" alt="I&#039;m With Fred" title="I&#039;m With Fred" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="225" height="160" align="left" />In 1996, I quit writing my Town Hall column because I was sick of party politics.  Specifically, I was sick of the GOP running losers because it was their turn.  (Dole)  I worked hard for Bush in 2000, mostly because the alternative would have been disastrous, not because of any strong feelings for W. The whole time--going on 10 years now--I&#039;ve longed for a new Reagan, a candidate about whom my passions might soar.</p>
<p>Along comes Fred Thompson, the next president of the United States.  Actor, Senator, lawyer, and plain-spoken genius.  Most importantly, if he runs, he will win:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energizes every Republican and conservative faction</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6764234,00.html" target="_blank">Energizes young people</a> (even though they don&#039;t vote--they get attention)</li>
<li>Destroys opponents in debate and argument</li>
<li>Makes critics look mean and stupid with simple, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCVNuSA__-g">honest responses</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have placed a link to <a href="http://www.imwithfred.com/index.aspx">a web site dedicated to make Fred&#039;s</a> transition into a full-fledged candidate easy for everyone.  Please drop a few dollars on the site&#039;s collection plate, sign up, and help get this man the GOP nomination and election in 2008.  It&#039;ll be the best thing you&#039;ve done for your children in years.&nbsp; Not only will our individual passions soar, Fred can restore America to that "shining city on a hill,&#039; that Regan delivered.</p>
<p>With Thompson in the White House, we won&#039;t have to worry about surrendering to Islamofascists as the Democrats hope we do and as <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/07/democrats-liberal-media-demand-mass.html" target="_blank">The Gateway Pundit</a> expertly combats.&nbsp;</p>
