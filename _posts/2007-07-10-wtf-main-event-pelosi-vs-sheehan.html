<p>The anti-Bush Frankenstein is about eat her maker. </p>
<p> With a quote that perfectly demonstrates the liberal idea of freedom (thanks to <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/10/its-official-cindys-on-her-way-to-washington/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a>) Cindy "it's about me" Sheehan has declared she intends to take Nancy Pelosi's seat in Congress in 2008.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a dream of the detention centers that George has built&hellip;filled with Orange Clad neo-cons and neo-connettes</p></blockquote>
<p> That's you and me, baby. </p>
<p>Perhaps Ms. Sheehan will wind up in a small room with soft walls and and off-white jumpsuit.  Or the next Mrs. Michael Moore, a far crueler fate. (She's running for Congress because she hears voices that tell her what to do, and I'm not making this up.  h/t <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2007/07/09/video-the-voices-in-my-head-told-me-to-challenge-pelosi-says-st-cindy/">michelle</a>)</p>

Rhymes with Right</a> is offended at Cindy's goal of putting her opponents into political prisons.  Just remember, children, Hitler was a liberal, too.<br />
