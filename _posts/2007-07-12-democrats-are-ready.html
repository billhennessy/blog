<p>The Democrat Party released its official <a href="http://www.gopbloggers.org/mt/archives/004985.php">agendum for the 2008 party convention today</a>. Mark Noonan, journalist extraordinaire, obtained an advance copy.</p>
<p>From the opening flag-burning to the end-of-evening driving arrangements, the party of defeat has thought of everything.</p>
<p>Mark has formatted the schedule for convenient printing and laminating.  Be sure to share it with your friends.</p>
<p>Don't miss the first comment from a whinny liberal idiot, either.  </p>
