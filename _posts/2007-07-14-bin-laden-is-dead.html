<p>Maybe.  Maybe not.</p>
<p>But the new al-Qaeda video featuring a haggard  Osama bin Laden has folks speculating about his health and even his life.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/07/al-qaeda-releases-new-osama-tape.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit </a>compares the most recent video (in which bin Laden appears for less than a minute) with a video from 2002.  The background and bin Laden&#039;s attire are identical.  And doesn&#039;t look so hot.</p>
<p>If this is not a new taping, then it could be an attempt by al-Qaeda to hide the terrorist&#039;s death.  If bin Laden is dead and this video is a forgery, then Michael Moore better get his fat ass to Pakistan to expose this conspiracy.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://freedomeden.blogspot.com/2007/07/bin-ladens-backdont-look.html">Freedom Eden,</a> Mary has another take on the new tape that is worth a read.</p>
