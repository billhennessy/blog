<p>For the past 4 years, Russian dictator Putin has moved his country closer and closer to its pre-Yeltsin isolation.  Today, he announced <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/14/AR2007071400641.html">suspension of NATO inspections</a> of nuclear missile sites.</p>
<blockquote><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree freezing participation in the treaty that cited "extraordinary circumstances ... that affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures," the Kremlin said in a statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia continues a military build-up which most Americans have ignored.</p>
<p>Some will accuse me of longing for the good old days of the Cold War, but they're missing a dangerous story if they do.</p>
<p>I don't trust Putin, and I don't think I'm alone.  Over at <a href="http://depleteduranium.wordpress.com/2007/07/14/germans-should-be-nervous/">Depleted Uranium</a>, a writer points out that Russia is amassing tank divisions near the Polish border.  A weak Poland is all that stands between Russia and Germany.</p>
<p>Perhaps the 2008 candidates should spend a little time thinking about these ominous signs from the Bear of the East, and perhaps we should all appreciate Condi Rice's expertise a bit more.  (Secretary Rice is a Russian expert.)</p>
