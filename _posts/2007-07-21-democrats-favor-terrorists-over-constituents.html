    <strong>The Democrats want you to keep silent and not talk</strong>

    Michelle Malkin's got some great looking photoshops showing what the Democrats would really like of America's citizens, provided by Gates of Vienna, Are We Lumberjacks, and a few others.

    I saw Michelle's post after I blogged this.  She always has some of the best stuff on the net.

    Hey, thanks for reading.  I appreciate it.

<p>I hyperbolize now and then, but not this time.</p>
<p>Democrats in the House and Senate voted to encourage criminal prosecution of Americans who report suspicious activity (<a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/07/dnc-kill-john-doe-poster-campaign.html">Gateway Pundit</a>).  Do you know how difficult it is to formulate a more dramatic representation of that fact than the fact itself (<a href="http://discerningtexan.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-democrat-war-on-terror-ad-campaign.html">Discerning Texan</a>)?</p>
<p>I hate Democrats.  Yeah, I know, you're not supposed to "hate" anyone.  But Democrats are anti-American ass hats.  They breed socialism.  They hate good.  They love evil.  My next book will be re-titled "101 ways to kill a Democrat."  I hate them, I hate them, I hate them.  May they die painful deaths and burn in hell for eternity.</p>
<p>Democrats want to put you in jail for turning in Muslim terrorists.</p>
<p>It's against the law to attempt to stop an act of terrorism.</p>
<p>Democrats are terrorists.</p>
<p>It's against the law to try to stop Democrats.</p>
<p>America:  free no more.</p>
