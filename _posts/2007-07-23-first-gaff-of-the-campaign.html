<p><a href="http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/g/216a8640-745f-4180-8662-79a7a05ab587" target="_blank">If Hugh Hewitt is right</a>, the distinction goes to Barack Obama for promising to meet the leaders of "Iran, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela and North Korea without precondition."</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Didn't Jimmy Carter promise something like that in 1976?  Except then it was China, the Soviet Union, East Germany, and the Grand Dutchy of Fenwick.</p>
<p>This gaff (is that how to spell "gaff?") came during the YouTube debate, which I didn't watch.  I actually have avoided everything about it, but I stumbled onto Hugh Hewitt and had to giggle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/07/23/their-debate/">Jeff Jarvis</a> confirms my original instinct to stay far away.</p>
<p>I suppose Obama didn't win.  Who did?</p>
