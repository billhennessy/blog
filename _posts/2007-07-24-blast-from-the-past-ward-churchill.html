  content: He has gained super hero status with the left because of his repugnant
    beliefs and statements. Now the left will believe that he walks on water. He will
    likely make millions from his lawsuit against the university. He will be portrayed
    as an underdog and martyr by the left-wing press. He will be paid millions more
    on the lecture circuit as the darling of extremists everywhere.

    Like Cindy Sheehan?  He's served their purpose.  Where were they these past two years?

    He'll lose his lawsuits--nothing to stand on.  I doubt we'll hear much of Ward Churchill again.

    The Duke lacrosse team fiasco shows that liberal educators have created a phony cultural paradigm that distorts reality. And, nobody exploits phony paradigms, obfuscates truth, or games the system like the Clintons.

    Shades of Ward Churchill: I Got Your University; Right Here

    Set the Wayback Machine for 23 August 1995: a hot day in the nation&rsquo;s capitol. But 3000 miles due west on California&rsquo;s Central Coast, a constellation of events was unfolding that would have a profound effect on Western civilization; plunge it into war. Yet, this cataclysmic upheaval was only part of the plan. Bill Clinton picked up the telephone. It was his Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, calling from a payphone in Monterey. Bill held the receiver at arms length and gazed at the tasteful floral arrangement that adorned the Oval Office. Leon&rsquo;s disembodied voice filled the room. What now, asked Hillary. It&rsquo;s that damn college, mouthed Bill. There was, no getting out. Hillary nodded, just tell Leon he&rsquo;ll get whatever he needs: http://theseedsof9-11.com

<p>Funny thing . . . last night, I was cruising around one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://www.pirateballerina.com/blog/entry.php?id=672">The Pirate Ballerina</a>, to see how the battle of Ward<img border="0" vspace="4" align="right" width="181" src="http://www.pirateballerina.com/files/churchillsmall.jpg" hspace="4" height="151" /> Churchill was going. It turns out, reading <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/24/the-fate-of-ward-churchill/">Michelle Malkin</a>, that CU's decision to fire or retain the plagiarist, almost-American Indian renegade professor is due tonight.</p>
<p>I'll add links to my previous WC posts shortly. In the meantime, go over to <a href="http://www.pirateballerina.com/">Pirate Ballerina</a> and take a stroll down memory lane.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Now, take stroll down my <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?cat=31">Ward Churchill Memory Lane</a></p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.pirateballerina.com/blog/entry.php?id=672">From Pirate Ballerina</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><font size="+0"><font size="2"><strong>Update (5:36):</strong> More than an hour and a half later than anticipated, the CU Regents reconvene to vote publicly on the dismissal of Professor Ward Churchill.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="+0"><font size="2">Update (5:36): 8-1 motion to dismiss Churchill is passed. Regents adjourn.</font></font></p></blockquote>
<p>The saga of Ward Churchill ends with his dismissal. Good riddance.</p>
<p>I wonder if Werner Klemperrer came out to announce "Diiiismissed!"</p>
<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/24/the-fate-of-ward-churchill/">MM </a>was right on top of it, too.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Here's the fantastic YouTube video, including the long-haired, maggot-infested, hippie, FM types shouting "bullshit" at the end, just before they go back to their dorm rooms to smash up some stems and seeds because they can't afford real dope.</p>
<p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs9FupCmWko]</p>
<p>And check out the stereotype audience down-right. See him? With the maggot-infested beard and long hair? Classic. He'll spend the next three years mailing bombs to computer scientists, but in 2017 he'll be a Wall Street bond salesman making $7 million and writing books about why he's not a sell-out.</p>
<p>Looking through the archives, I found this tidbit of my own wisdom for Blackbeard:</p>
<blockquote><p>More frightening [than Churchill] are his defenders. Like the Brown Shirts, they defend his &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; perspective and the fact that he &ldquo;makes people think.&rdquo; No, boys and girls of academia, he doesn&rsquo;t make people think: he makes people respond the way an angry dog responds when poked with a stick. Ward Churchill is scum with a microphone, stinking up American society with thoughtless, moronic words strung together into sentences designed to inspire hate and encourage terrorism.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/010620.php">Captain Ed makes a good point</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He [Churchill] has misrepresented himself and sought to inflate his public profile on the backs of dead victims of terrorism. His firing has little to do with this, and so it has little to do with issues of academic freedom. The only connection comes from his own efforts to draw attention to his hateful diatribes, which launched a thousand research projects into his background. Churchill is a ridiculous and petty figure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ed goes on to indicate that the publicity from his firing undoes the good of his firing. I disagree. Churchill's firing will not launch a needed avalanche of firings of lousy professors, but academia's cowardice only gives us more cause to applaud Colorado's hubris.</p>
