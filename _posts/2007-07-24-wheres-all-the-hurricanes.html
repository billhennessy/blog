<p>Al Gore said this would be the worst year for hurricanes since hurricaning began, in 1952.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gopbloggers.org/mt/archives/005005.php" target="_blank">Matt Margolis</a>, who does great research, has the answer.</p>
<blockquote><p>The 2007 hurricane season may be less severe than forecast due to cooler-than-expected water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, private forecaster WSI Corp said on Tuesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just not enough global warming.&nbsp; The Gores'll have to kick out a lot more CO2 in 2008.&nbsp; See Matt's piece for the whole story.</p>
