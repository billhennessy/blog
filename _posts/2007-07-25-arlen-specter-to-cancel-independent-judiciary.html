    The Duke lacrosse team fiasco shows that liberals have created a phony cultural paradigm that distorts reality. And, no one exploits phony paradigms, obfuscates truth, or games the system like the Clintons. Point being, miscreants like Ward Churchill have powerful political backers: the fish rots from the head.

    The Taliban might as well as run the university.  -David Horowitz

    Set the Wayback Machine for 23 August 1995: a hot day in the nation&rsquo;s capitol. But 3000 miles due west on California&rsquo;s Central Coast, a constellation of events was unfolding that would have a profound effect on Western civilization; plunge it into decades of war. Yet, this cataclysmic upheaval was only part of the plan. Bill Clinton picked up the telephone. It was his Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, calling from a payphone in Monterey. Bill held the receiver at arms length and gazed at the tasteful floral arrangement that adorned the Oval Office. Leon&rsquo;s disembodied voice filled the room. What now, asked Hillary. It&rsquo;s that damn college, mouthed Bill. There was, no getting out. Hillary nodded, just tell Leon he&rsquo;ll get whatever he needs: http://theseedsof9-11.com

<p>In an attempt to overturn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Appointment_and_tenure">Marbury v. Madison</a>, Senator Arlen Specter, a far-left Republican, intends to bring up two Supreme Court justices on perjury charges. (source, <a href="http://stlcofcc.wordpress.com/2007/07/25/arlen-specter-threatens-to-assassinate-supreme-court-justices-john-roberts-samuel-alito-and-assaults-judicial-independence/">StLCofCC</a>)<br />
Arlen Specter is an ass.  This, children, is why we <em>don't feed the liberals!</em></p>
