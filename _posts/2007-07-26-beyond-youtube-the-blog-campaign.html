    cnn and YouTube decide how the debates are going to be handled and we are all supposed to fall in line with these liberals.
    This is a test of courage according to a couple of blog stars so we have to follow their lead as well.
    The ratings were lower than the first debate so YouTube didn't make any gains there.
    cnn decided what questions would be asked. That is an encouraging bit of news for conservatives.
    The majority of viewers I would bet were liberals. I didn't talk to anyone who watched the debates for more
    than just a short time.
    Let the candidates go on Fox News where there is a decent audience, let Brit Hume, Charles Krauthammer, Juan
    Williams, and Chris Wallace ask the questions and we might have a real debate.

<p>Matt Margolis at <a href="http://www.gopbloggers.org/mt/archives/005007.php" target="_blank">GOP Bloggers</a> questions the cutting-edginess of the YouTube debate.  He's right in his various points about the ordinariness of the whole affair.</p>
<p>To make the presidential race more interesting, I propose a blog-off.  The candidates have to start a blog using a commonly available blog app:  WordPress (my fave), MoveableType, etc.  The candidate with the highest TLB Ecosystem score wins his party's nomination.</p>
<p>The rules</p>
<ol>
<li>Posts must be submitted by the candidate himself or herself.  The FEC will supervise the posts to ensure they come from the candidate</li>
<li>Blog must be hosted on a discount hosting site, and the candidate himself must deal with DNS problems, server outages, and database problems caused by the fetishist blog sharing the same MySQL server.</li>
<li> Candidate campaign contributions are limited to money raised from their banner advertising.</li>
<li>Banner advertising cannot solicit donations for that candidate's campaign.</li>
<li>Candidates are prohibited from any other form of advertising, save for live appearances.</li>
<li>Candidates must respond to all comments within 15 minutes, lest be compared to female genitalia.</li>
<li>Each blog entry must contain at least 3 links to other blogs, at lease one of which requiring manual trackback.</li>
<li>At least one entry per day must be posted between the hours 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. in the candidate's time zone.</li>
<li>The candidate's internet service provider must be publicly available.  Charter's Pipeline serves them right.</li>
<li>Each candidate must appear first on the <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2007/07/beltway_traffic_jam-525/" target="_blank">OTB Beltway Traffic Jam</a> at least once before his party's convention.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ten simple rules.  Think they can follow them?  Oh, and the winner gets custom pajamas.</p>
