<p>The soldier who wrote under a pseudonym for The New Republic revealed himself as Private Scott T. Beauchamp.   Powerline describes the son-of-a-bitch: "  He's a pretentious ass, and a lefty."  Well, that's a French name, isn't it?</p>
<p><a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/018343.php" target="_blank">Read more</a> on PowerLine.  Then read more about Beauchamp on <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/26/scott-thomas-steps-out-of-the-shadows/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a> (link also on PL).</p>
<p>This guy'll be the next Cindy Sheehan--until the left is done with him and casts him aside like greasy, black banana peel.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; The American Mind has a great round-up of the Scott Thomas story entitled "<a href="http://www.theamericanmind.com/2007/07/26/the-obligatory-scott-thomas-post/" target="_blank">The Obligatory Scott Thomas Post</a>," which I appreciate.</p>
