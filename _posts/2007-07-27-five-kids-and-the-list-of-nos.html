<p>Five kids is a lot these days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You have <em>five</em> kids?&nbsp; Oh, my God!" people say, their eyes bugged out, mouths wide open.</p>
<p>Even when the oldest were babies, developmental psychologists were advising parent not to tell children "no."&nbsp; Their theory was that "no" would teach a child limitation and destroy his curiosity.&nbsp; Instead, offer an alternative.&nbsp; Well, that doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the funny thing is, it's the no "no" advice is totally out of synch with society.</p>
<p>My dad came home from two wars:&nbsp; World War II and Korea.&nbsp; I try, these humid summer nights when the whole house is asleep, to think to of the prohibitions Jack Hennessy faced in 1953.&nbsp; He change the oil in his car, smoke in the grocery store and Sears, drive a car without a seatbelt, build a house to own liking, spank his kids, let his 16-year-old kids swim without a lifeguard, ride a bike without a helmet, tear down his house and build a new one, fly the American flag, and wash his car in the driveway.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the things his grandchildren can't do.&nbsp; And the list of "NO"s getst longer every day, doesn't it.&nbsp; For instance, his son, according McCain-Feingold, cannot blog 60 days before an election.&nbsp; Petty little pleasures, aren't they? that&nbsp;society denies us.&nbsp; And it denies us more every, every day.</p>
<p>It saddens me when I read young people's blogs that seem to encourage the government to deny more freedoms.&nbsp; They seem willing, even eager, to trade their little bit of freedom for some guarantee of health, wealth, and happiness.&nbsp; How said and naive.&nbsp; Of course, their little pieces of freedom are so puny by 1953 standards, it's no wonder they're willing to cast them aside.&nbsp; Sam Adams and George Washington knew some serious freedom; they were eager to die to preserve it for their kids.</p>
<p>And absolute prohibitions are only the start of our denied freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't do a lot of things without money, so another way society limits our freedom--places more "NO"s on us--is taxation.&nbsp; When Dad came home from Korea, combined taxes were 25 percent of GNP.&nbsp; Today, the percentage of the economy that goes to taxes is almost 40 percent.&nbsp; That's a lot of freedom transplanted from the people to the politicians.</p>
<p>There are dangers in driving without a seat belt, shooting off fireworks, and swimming in a river.&nbsp; There is life in these things, too.&nbsp; There is excitement and rush and flush and pleasure.&nbsp; There is childhood and feeling grown up.&nbsp; There is joy and memory and anticipation and running through the woods at night laughing with your friends.&nbsp; There is freedom.&nbsp; And maybe real freedoms would make the escapism of recreational-<em>cum</em>-addictive drugs&nbsp; and careless sex less attractive.&nbsp; Maybe young people today would act more like kids in the 50s if they were allowed to act like kids in the 50s.</p>
<p>Freedom.</p>
<p>I'll never a have fortune to pass to my children.&nbsp; And unlike every generation that came before mine, it looks like I won't leave them a free country, either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes me wonder if my eleven years in the Navy were anything more than a crappy paycheck.</p>
<p>If you must vote on a single issue next year, freedom is the noblest single issue man can live or die for, especially when he has five hungry memories to feed.</p>
