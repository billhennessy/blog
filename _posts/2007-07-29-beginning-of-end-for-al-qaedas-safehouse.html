<p>For years, now, al Qaeda and Taliban criminals have used the Western mountains of Pakistan as their home base.&nbsp; Emboldened by Pakistani President Musharraf's reluctance to deal with radical Islam head-on, the Taliban have recently begun a campaign to turn Pakistan into what Afghanistan was before 9/11.</p>
<p>Ed Morrissey had been keeping up with these events, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/010662.php">this story today on Captain's Quarters </a>may signal the end to Musharraf's patience with the radicals.</p>
<p>Let's hope so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we know that leaders--even our own--tend to get weak-kneed when push comes to bullets.&nbsp; Remember that it was Musharraf who wanted the US Army to let local tribesman capture Bin Laden in 2002--tribesmen who let the murderer escape.&nbsp; During the siege of the Red Mosque last month, Musharraf allowed numerous deadlines to pass.</p>
<p>All of these actions embolden the enemy.</p>
<p>If Musharraf is serious about crippling Islamofascism in Pakistan, he must prosecute the war ruthlessly.&nbsp; Not an easy thing, since Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will be calling for him to stop the bloodshed.</p>
