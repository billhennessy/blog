<p><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007350097,00.html" target="_blank">The Sun Online </a>carries the story of new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's rather effusive praise of George W. Bush's leadership.</p>
<p>In his speech, Brown referred to Winston Churchill:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="norm12"></p>
<p align="left">The Prime Minister vowed to take Winston Churchill&rsquo;s lead and make Britain&rsquo;s ties with America even stronger.</p>
<p align="left">Mr Brown stunned critics by <strong>THANKING</strong> President Bush for the fight against Islamic extremism, and insisted the UK-US relationship will be his No1 foreign policy priority.</p>
<p align="left">He said on his first visit to the President&rsquo;s US retreat at Camp David: &ldquo;Winston Churchill spoke of the &lsquo;joint inheritance&rsquo; of our two countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="norm12"></p>
<p align="left">Many expected Brown to chill US-UK relations on the heels of Tony Blair's tight relationship with the White House.&nbsp; If chill is to come, it will come another day, I suppose.</p>
