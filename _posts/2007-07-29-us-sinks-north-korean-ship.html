<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/07/us-sinks-north-korean-ship-bound-for.html">The Gateway Pundit </a>(which you should read every day) discusses a Debka File report claiming the US sank a North Korean ship bound for Iran carrying nuclear weapon making cargo.</p>
<p>Debka is <em>notorious</em> for reporting stories that&nbsp;are, well, stories that aren't true.&nbsp; But such a heavy-handed action by the US could explain North Korea's recent cooperation on the nuclear front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll keep our eye's peeled.</p>
