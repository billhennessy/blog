<p>Thompson's enemies in both parties--all Democrats and the Republicans running for President--are acting like the $3 million raised by his exploratory committee in June&nbsp;dooms his candidacy.</p>
<p>Nonesense.</p>
<p>First, Fred formed the committee on June 4.&nbsp; It takes a while to get the money flow started, to get people going to the websites, etc.&nbsp; If the average daily gross for June 24 - June 30 were no greater than that of the first week, I'd be more concerned.</p>
<p>Second, Fred's donations are coming mostly from grassroots conservatives.&nbsp; While the lefties want people think we're all Rockefellers and Gateses, we're not.&nbsp; Some of us woke up giddy today because it's pay day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, Fred Thompson's support, in my humble opinion, comes from people and places who are not usually interested in candidates this early.&nbsp; Like Reaganites, they don't contribute to campaigns, they don't work phone banks, they don't put signs in their yards or stickers on their cars unless they know the candiate personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's see how Fred's fundraising dinners go, and how his opponents overplay their hand on this phony contribution story.&nbsp; And cast a gimlet eye towards <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0707/5156.html">the blogs </a>that quote "Republican" insiders; the party insiders I know are <em>always</em> working an angle.&nbsp; Pity those <a target="_blank" href="http://www.for-president.us/thompson%e2%80%99s-fundraising-numbers-are-a-self-trap.html">who fret </a>that Fred Thompson has out-witted himself.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp;some Thompson supporters not associated with the campaign apparently were <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=21677">floating ridiculous numbers </a>to the press.&nbsp; That doesn't help.&nbsp;Managing expectations should be left to the professionals, not attempted by armchair Roger Ayleses.</p>
