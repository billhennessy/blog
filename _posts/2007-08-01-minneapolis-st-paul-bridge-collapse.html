<p><em>UPDATE and Bump:  Predictably, the idiot left has begun blaming George W. Bush and the Iraq War on Terror for the bridge collapse (<a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/08/moonbats-blame-bushs-war-for-mn-bridge.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a>).  They know they're full of manure.  Saturday, liberal Bob Beckel on FoxNews admitted that there was no connection, but he went to explain the liberal lies:  "Those of us who are opposed to this war will anything to advance our point."  </em></p>
<p><em>It's nice to hear a Democrat fess up to lying.   </em></p>
<p>I came home feeling feverish and went to bed earlier.  I woke up at 9:30, planning to do some blogging.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.visi.com/~jweeks/bridges/pages/ms16.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.visi.com/~jweeks/bridges/pics/i35wmiss02.jpg" style="width:300px;height:200px;" align="right" border="0" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>But my first glance</p>
<p>around the world began with <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/010703.php">Captain's Quarter </a>where I learned of the bridge collapse and of Ed Morrissey's search for his</p>
<p>dauther-in-law and granddaaughter. They are okay.</p>
<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/08/01/minneapolis-bridge-collapse/">Michelle Malkin </a>has continuing coverage.</p>
<p>CNN has continuous live feed. ***UPDATE*** CNN's live feed stopped at 10:40 p.m. CDT.</p>
<p>Nothing else deserves comment. This deserves only my prayers.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://www.visi.com/~jweeks/bridges/pages/ms16.html" target="_blank">the bridge before the collapse </a>for reference--you'll be seen plenty of the after photos to compare.</p>
