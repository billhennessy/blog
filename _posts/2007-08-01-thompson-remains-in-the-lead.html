<p>The latest <a href="http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/presidential_tracking_poll" target="_blank">Rasmussen poll </a>of likely primary voters completed July 31 shows Fred Thompson in front:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the race for the <strong>Republican Presidential nomination, </strong>former Tennessee  Senator Fred Thompson remains nominally on top with support from 26% of Likely  Republican Primary voters. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani remains  essentially even as the top choice for 24%. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt  Romney and <a href="#" class="iAs" style="border-bottom:.07em solid darkgreen;font-weight:normal;font-size:100%;padding-bottom:1px;color:darkgreen;background-color:transparent;text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank">Arizona Senator</a> John McCain are  each preferred by 12% (<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_2008__1/political_tracking_polling_history" title="blocked::http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_2008__1/political_tracking_polling_history" target="_self">see daily history</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>The significance, here, is not the margin of the lead, but the consistency.  Thompson has now led the poll since mid-July, except for a one day tie on 7/25.</p>
<p>Additionally, the poll finds that Thompson <em>is the only candidate who voters consider "conservative."</em>  That is huge come the general election.  If the Republican party nominates a moderate or liberal, then we might as well for the Democrat and get the real thing.</p>
<p>Numerous races, including Reagan and Norm Coleman, show that the GOP's best hope is to run a conservative who starkly contrasts the Democrat opponent.  Head to head, conservatism always wins because it works.  Liberalism loses because it fails every time its tried.</p>
