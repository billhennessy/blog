<p>The UN Security Council, today, finally got around to approving a 26,000-strong force to control the violence in Darfur (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,291594,00.html">FoxNews.com</a>).</p>
<p>I have a depressing suspicion that this means there are no Christians left for the Muslims to kill in Darfur. <a target="_blank" href="http://expatyank.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/drop-that-weapon-so-i-can-monitor-it/">Expat Yank</a> thinks the same:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are only two reasons a predator state engaged in fomenting widespread slaughter (the UN has not termed Darfur &ldquo;genocide&rdquo;) will voluntarily allow in a UN peacekeeping force: 1) that state has already accomplished most of its &rdquo;slaughter&rdquo; goals (remember, this conflict began in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073101731.html" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073101731.html">February 2003</a>), or 2) it doesn&rsquo;t believe the UN force will be able to accomplish much of anything anyway, so its best to let it be deployed in order to get the &ldquo;international community&rdquo; off its back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadder, still, is the lack of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.technorati.com/posts/tag/darfur">blog and editorial reaction</a> to the news. A couple of years ago, even Barack Obama was calling for action in Sudan--even unilateral US military action. Today, nothing.</p>
<p>Either genocide has become too familiar to notice, or the economy is providing enough distractions that otherwise good people don't care.</p>
<p>Also, Theo Spark has <a target="_blank" href="http://theospark.blogspot.com/2007/08/wednesday-bits.html">the official banner of the operation</a>.</p>
