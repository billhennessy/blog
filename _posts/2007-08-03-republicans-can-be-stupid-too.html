<p>We nominated Bob Dole, didn't we?</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://texasfred.net/archives/401" target="_blank">TexasFred</a>'s has been listening in on the Romney campaign and heard this:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#333333;">Mitt Romney has cited the social welfare network of the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group as a role model the U.S. should copy to help promote &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; and &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; around the world.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I know . . . out of context, read the whole thing, and all that.&nbsp; Still, a guy running for president ought to know that praising Hezbollah is a good way to become a really, really difficult trivia question about people who ran for president in 2008.</p>
