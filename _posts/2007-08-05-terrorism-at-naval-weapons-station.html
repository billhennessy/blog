<p>**UPDATE**&nbsp;<br />
Michelle Malkin reports that the two suspects arrested&nbsp;with explosives near Charleston, SC, last night are Muslims.&nbsp; See <a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/08/05/saturday-night-bomb-scare/">MichelleMalkin.com </a>for updated details. (Maybe they were on their way home from <a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8107">YearlyKos</a>.)&nbsp; From the Charleston <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abcnews4.com/news/stories/0807/444994.html">ABC News affiliate's website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Berkeley County Sheriff's Office believes that&nbsp;among materials in the car's trunk were a bomb and bomb making materials that include chemicals, fuses, and igniters.&nbsp; The men 21-year-old Yousef Megahed and 24-year-old Ahmed Mohamed&nbsp;were pulled over Saturday evening during a routine traffic&nbsp;stop near Myers Road and Highway 176.</p>
<p><!--more--></p></blockquote>
<p>How did I miss this? <a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/08/05/saturday-night-bomb-scare/">Michelle Malkin </a>reported a possible terrorism attempt a Naval Weapons Station, Charleston--just outside Charleston, SC.</p>
<p>I lived on Lafayette Street in the Weapons Station for 2 years, and my submarines were stationed there for refit several time between 1985 and 1992.</p>
<p>As of 9:35 a.m. today, the facts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday, 6:00 p.m. Police stopped a 4-door sedan on highway 176 in Goose Creek, SC</li>
<li>Saturday, 6:10 p.m. to midnight, fire departments, bomb squads, and FBI converged on the scene</li>
<li>Sunday after midnight the FBI used a robot to extract materials from the vehicle</li>
<li>Sunday, 9:35 a.m., <a target="_blank" href="http://www.charleston.net/news/2007/aug/05/possible_bomb_scare_shuts_down_goose_creek_highway/">Charleston Post-Courier's</a> latest update, but no conclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a lot of friends who retired to the Goose Creek area. Hope all is well.</p>
<p>The Naval Weapons Station was one of the most secure places in the nuclear submarine world. Check out the comments to the Post-Courier story.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a target="_blank" href="http://newwars.blogspot.com/2007/08/breaking-bomb-threat-in-charleston.html">New Wars blog</a> says a witness reports that police detonated the explosive device.&nbsp; Same story on<a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070805/ap_on_re_us/highway_closed"> Yahoo News</a></p>
