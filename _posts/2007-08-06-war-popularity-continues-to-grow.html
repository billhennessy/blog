    Of the major media in the US, only Fox allows conservative opinion.  The newspapers you hear about--USAToday, Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times--and the major news networks--CBS, NBC, PBS, NPR, ABC, CNN--are of, by, and for the liberals who support and defend Muslims' unholy "right" to kill.  They don't allow much voice to those of us on the right.

    My wife and I are both American citizens, neither of us Israeli.  Neither of us has Jewish ancestry, as far as we know.  My support for Israel, however, is unwavering, as is my love of the Jews, my brothers and sisters in faith, as John Paul II put it.

    "24" is one of my favorite television shows, particularly when Jack tortures Muslim terrorists.  Good stuff.  Of course, Muslims  don't watch fictionalized torture on television--they do in their basements for kicks, the way we play foosball or billiards.

    American society has some ills.  As my blog's archives show, abortion is a drain on our culture, a cancerous stain that we need to remove.  My book, The Conservative Manifesto, details many other social ills.

    However, our women are not what your imam tells you.  I know and have known wonderful, strong women who know right and do right. The average American woman runs moral circles around the best of your Muslim men.  Our women are also better educated and more resourceful than you could possibly imagine.  Our society will trump yours because we bring to bear all of our talent, not just the males, not just the Christians or Jews, and not just the violent.

    We produce women like Mother Angelica who build great ministries that bring people to God.  We produce women like my wife who give up jobs in finance to work with special needs children in public schools.  We have women like my step-daughter who is a paragon of virtue, self-sacrifice, and kindness.  And we manage, somehow, to produce generations of these women without criminally mutilating their genitalia--a crime supported nowhere in the Koran or any other "holy" book.  And I never met a Muslim who didn't smoke when he was in America attending college.

    Where do I send the bill for your education, cimoc?  And let me know if you need more.

    We also have something else Cimoc and his culture lacks:

    Compassion.

<p>The second poll in a week--this one by <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2007/08/latest-poll-sho.html" target="_blank">USAToday</a>/Gallup--shows that support for the war in Iraq is growing.  The latest poll shows that public perception of America's success has increased substantially in the past month. The numbers coincide with the increasing effectiveness of the surge.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the latest USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, taken Friday through Sunday, the proportion of those who said the additional troops are "making the situation better" rose to 31% from 22% a month ago. Those who said it was "not making much difference" dropped to 41% from 51%.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8058" target="_blank"> I blogged about</a> a similar NYTimes/CBS poll released quietly on July 23 showed a 6 percentage point increase in public support.  (NYTimes buries the story in its blog section, while CBS.com didn't mention it.)</p>
<p>Having two polls in two weeks show the same trend is significant, as the second poll validates the first.  The increasing popularity also demonstrates that the MSM aren't working hard enough at recuiting losers.  <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/010860.php" target="_blank">Ed Morrissey</a> downplays the numbers believing the upside is tempered by a majority wanting a complete withdrawal by April.</p>
<p>Perhaps.  But I'd like to pull out by April, too--with total victory in hand.  I think some portion of those who want the pullout want victory, too.  I'm not sure how pullout numbers would look if the question were, "Do you support or oppose a complete military withdrawal even if it means defeat for the US and genocide in Iraq?"</p>
<p>More interesting to me is <em>why now</em>?  We know that July was the least lethal month for our folks in quite a while.  I think there's more, though.</p>
<p>Americans, I've noticed, pull back their support when those out front seem overzealous.  I think we get suspicious, like when a salesman continues to sell the product after you've said, "Yes."  We wonder if maybe there's more to the movement than meets the eye--maybe a hidden agenda among the leaders that's concealed from the rank and file.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the numbers are positive.  I hope the Pentagon keeps the pressure on the terrorists.  As I mentioned after the NYTimes/CBS poll, Americans love a winner, they like the aggressor, we want to take it to them instead of waiting for them to bring it to us.</p>
<p>For those in Iraq, keep up the great fight.  God bless you and noble mission.</p>
