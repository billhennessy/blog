<p>Someone calling himself <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8116#comment-372">Mullah Cirac posted a comment</a> to an earlier post on the growing popularity of the war in Iraq.  I posted a long reply to the Mullah.  Then I checked my comments meta to see if he left legit e-mail and website.  I don't know about the e-mail, but web url he claims as his belongs to a girl from Texas who might be able to kick Cirac's unholy ass from Mecca to Odessa.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=21012024&amp;blogID=296590446">AniMEL</a> writes about "Nazi America."  When I saw the title and started reading, I expected that the mullah had led me to a post that would "prove" America is the great Satan for killing and incarcerating fine young terrorists.  But the post goes in a different direction, and it goes there under the pen of a talented story teller.  If you read nothing else today, <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=21012024&amp;blogID=296590446">read AniMEL's Nazi America</a>.  She's obviously the kind of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8116#comment-488">American woman</a> I wrote about in my reply to Mullah Cirac.</p>
<p>***UPDATE***<br />
DOH!  I was looking at the wrong comment.  Mel, of aniMEL fame, responded reasonably to one of my unreasonable tirades.  I thought the url on her comment was the url on Mullah Cirac's.  Everything else I wrote above, though, landed squarely on the nail's head. </p>
