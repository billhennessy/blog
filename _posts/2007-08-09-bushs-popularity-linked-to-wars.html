<p>Over the past two or three weeks, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8116">several polls</a> have shown increased support for the war in Iraq.&nbsp; Now, we see that President Bush's poll numbers are up.
<ul>
<li>AP/IPSOS poll shows Bush's favorability up to 31 percent in July from 28 in June</li>
<li>CBS/NYT found that 42 percent now consider the war in Iraq "the right thing to do"</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,292709,00.html">FoxNews.com </a>a longer list of the small victories President Bush and the Pentagon have achieved in Iraq and with the public.&nbsp; It's must reading, because it drives home the breadth and the depth of this growing support.&nbsp; Even Sen. Dick Durbin admits things in Baghdad are getting better.Two things to take away from this:<strong>Bush and the war are inexorably linked</strong>:&nbsp; Since we first went into Iraq in 2003, Bush's success as a president has been linked to one outcome:&nbsp; the war.&nbsp; When all was well, his numbers went up.&nbsp; When he allowed the Pentagon to adopt a hunker down strategy, public perception was that we were losing.&nbsp; Now that we're back on the offensive and the news is improving, so Bush's numbers.&nbsp; There is a lag, but Bush's numbers follow the war's numbers.<strong>People always assume the aggressor is winning:</strong> I've made this point before, but it's very important. Watch a boxing match and count the number of times the ring-side expert mentions "the aggressor" or "one the offensive."&nbsp; That's because boxing judges award points for scoring punches, not for dancing and dodging.&nbsp; Most of the time, the guy dodging ends up getting smacked.&nbsp; The aggressor usually wins.&nbsp; Sure, he can walk into a right hand and go down, but usually the aggressor wins.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this perception, when people hear the US is on the offense in Iraq, they perceive the US is winning.<strong>Stay on the offensive</strong>, Mr. President.&nbsp; Don't let generals or Secretaries of Defense tell you it's time to hunker down in the green zone.&nbsp; Listen to generals who've won wars, like Patton:&nbsp; "When in doubt, attack."&nbsp; If the surge continues, if we continue to kill more of theirs than they kill of ours, if we take Sean Connery's line from "The Untouchables*," we will win in Iraq and in the minds of Americans.&nbsp; If we hunker down, we might win in Iraq, but you'll never convince the people.&nbsp; If we pull out, you'll go down in history as a loser.<br />
