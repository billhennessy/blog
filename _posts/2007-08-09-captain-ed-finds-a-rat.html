<p>This is the <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/011065.php">blogosphere's answer to O. J. Simpson's low speed chase</a>.</p>
<p>If I were a client of Mr. Reynolds's law firm, I'd check my bill very closely for charges this date.&nbsp; Seems he's done nothing but DNS management all day.&nbsp; By 10:00 p.m., Reynolds will reach the end of the internet and www.imwithfred2008.com will point at Hennessy's View.</p>
<p>I hope.</p>
