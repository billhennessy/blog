    The corrected data was for the US surface air temperature, not for the global surface air temperature. See http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/

    The warmest year on record for the Earth was 2005. Then 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2004, 2001, 1997, 1995, 1990, 1991, 2000, 1999, 1988, 1996, 1987... you get the idea. R-squared for linear trend of 0.55 C/century is 0.73; in other words, a very strong trend.

    The US record years are 1934, 1998, 1921, 2006, 1931, 1999, etc. A *lot* more variation (R-squared = 0.14) but as the trendline indicates (0.48 C/century), the US trend is in line with the global trend.

    Agreed.  I should clarify, as the post isn't specific.  The changes were for US temps, not world.

    On the other hand, the numerous problems with world temp sensors and calculations remain.  And there's still the problem that Mars and Venus are warming, too.

    I seem to remember back in the early '90's everyone was freaking out about heading toward the next ice age.  Why do we buy this garbage?

    Oh, wait...I forgot...people are evil.  We've gotta have something to scare the crap out of us--without our daily dose of drama we'd shrivel up and die.  Thank you, Al Gore.

    Quick--everybody PANIC!

    In 1975, Newsweek ran a story about global cooling.  Pollution would block out the sun, giving us a kind of nuclear winter. Scholastic Book's Weekly Reader picked up the story, and I was thrilled.  I played hockey, and nine-month winters in St. Louis would make it another Toronto.

    Didn't happen, though.

<p>NASA was <em>wrong</em>!</p>
<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/08/09/hot-news-nasa-fixes-flawed-temperature-data-1998-was-not-the-warmest-year-in-the-millenium/">Michelle Malkin does an outstanding job </a>of breaking down the NASA Y2K error that sort of invented global warming.</p>
<p>In short, 1998 was NOT the hottest year of the 20th century.  And half of the hottest years on record occured before WWII.  Al Gore is an idiot, and now NASA scientists have proven it.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the wackos got bad news from U of C San Diego and NASA who discovered that <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8113">aerosols do not mask atmospheric warming but accelerate it</a>.  Now, we learn this from NASA:</p>
<blockquote><p>Four of the top ten are in the 1930&rsquo;s, <em>before mainstream scientists believe humans had any discernible impact on temperatures</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you believe human activity is responsible for global warming YOU'RE WRONG!</p>
<p>If you believe 8 of the hottest 10 years on record happened in the past 14 years, as Al Gore claims, YOU'RE WRONG!</p>
<p>If you believe that you lived through the hottest year on record, YOU'RE WRONG!</p>
<p>Good Lord, it feels good to tell enviro-wackos they're wrong.</p>
<p>But, there's more . . .</p>
<blockquote><p>Several years (2000, 2002, 2003, 2004) fell well down the leaderboard, behind even 1900. (World rankings of temperature are calculated separately.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, the only thing that Al Gore is right about is churning out more carbon than the average family of 60.</p>
<p>I'm setting the AC down to 68 degrees tonight.  Pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070810/D8QTT7IO0.html">AP story</a> on several endangered species making comeback, plus deforestation slowing in Peru.  Must be global warming.</p>
