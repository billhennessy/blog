<p>The weather&rsquo;s always good, for one;<br />
too hot, too cold, it rained, it snowed.<br />
Work will work&mdash;oh work is fine;<br />
busy, slow, mean boss, long lunch.<br />
Fatigue can be my friend at times<br />
when my eyes just won&rsquo;t stay open<br />
and energy that never ends<br />
comes in handy now and then.<br />
Kids are always under foot, it seems,<br />
wanting this and breaking that.<br />
My hair&rsquo;s a mess or just got fixed<br />
or won&rsquo;t stay put or needs a bath.<br />
Could my mood be any more in play?<br />
It&rsquo;s the same and always changing.<br />
Did I mention that I&rsquo;m out of gas?<br />
Have to leave a little early.<br />
When it&rsquo;s time to lay me down,<br />
down is how I&rsquo;m meant to lay,<br />
you don&rsquo;t get caught up in excuses:<br />
you&rsquo;ll get yours, you will, some day.</p>
