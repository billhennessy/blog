<p>I know this site has changed a lot, but there's a reason.</p>
<p>I was sick of the traditional blog format, so I switched to magazine layout.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the theme I used has incompatible with some plug-ins and javascript links I really need.&nbsp; So I customized the <a href="http://nalinmakar.com/hemingwayex" target="_blank">HemingwayEx </a>theme.</p>
<p>I love this theme (sorry if you don't) and plan to keep it for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Please scroll down to take my poll on the new theme.</strong></p>
