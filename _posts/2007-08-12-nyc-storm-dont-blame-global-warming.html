  content: I am a regular reader of your article.  And I am very impress with your
    blog upon Global Warming. Now I am also write a blog upon <b><a href="http://www.lifeofearth.blogspot.com"
    rel="nofollow">effects and causes of Global Warming</A></b>. This blog is collection
    of news &amp; reviews like the study found that global warming since 1985 has
    been caused neither by an increase in solar radiation nor by a decrease in the
    flux of galactic cosmic rays. Some researchers had also suggested that the latter
    might influence global warming because the rays trigger cloud formation.

<p>A NASA Goddard scientist says that the massive thunderstorm--complete with tornado--that struck New York City on Wednesday was not the result of global warming.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,292921,00.html">FoxNews.com article</a>, James Hansen explains that the storm cannot be blamed on climate change, but it can be attributed to human activity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,292943,00.html">Cities, it seems, make storms worse</a>.  Tall buildings direct wind upward, intensifying the storms.  City heat islands, like warm ocean water to a hurricane, fuel storms.  And objects in cities invite intense lightening strikes.</p>
<p>Oh, and for those of you in St. Louis who think this week's weather is unprecedented, you simply haven't lived or simply don't remember.  The string of relatively mild summers over the past decade have fooled you.  Go back to the 1950s when people slept on the side of Lindbergh Road to escape the heat of the city.  </p>
