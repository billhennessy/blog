<p>I don't know why this story depresses me so much, but it does.&nbsp; It makes me sad for a lot of people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293097,00.html" target="_blank">FoxNews.com</a> relays a Times of London story of a company that offers to financially, socially, and otherwise ruin people's lives for a meager $20 USD. &nbsp; I won't provide a link to the dreadful site.</p>
<blockquote><p> A service offering a complete "revenge package" in which people can destroy the financial status and relationships of their enemies at the click of a mouse is being offered over the Internet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the proprietors of the site have never been <em>in extremis</em>.&nbsp; If they are lucky, they've never had hushed conversations with a spouse--out of earshot of the kids--to choose, once and for all, between bankruptcy and foreclosure.&nbsp; Maybe they don't know the pain of telling the kids you're moving, not to a better house with more room and a new kitchen, but to a much smaller, older, less comfortable house that you can better afford.</p>
<blockquote><p>Victims' bank accounts can be shut down remotely and all their essential utilities cut off.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few victims of the web site's operators and clients might have something nasty coming to them.&nbsp; My guess is that many of the victims don't.&nbsp; The odds are pretty good that most of the victims are decent people trying to get through life the best they can--like many of us.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Create some false payslips [paychecks] and send them back returned to the victim's employer and watch them lose their job," it advises.</p>
<p>"Destroy a person's bank account using our novelty bank statements. Bank accounts are like gold dust now; return[ing] a novelty bank statement with their details back to the bank works for killing someones [sic] credit card account."</p></blockquote>
<p>That someone, enterprising and evil, would prey and profit on the vengeful hatred of ruthless people, destroying the lives of perfect strangers, irritates the most callous strands of my heart.</p>
<p>There are sick people in the world.&nbsp; We all knew that.&nbsp; But this is a kind of evil against which society has so few defenses.&nbsp; In classic identity theft, the thief, at least, makes a profit; he doesn't hand it over to a third party.&nbsp; With this outfit, the person exacting revenge walks away $20 and a soul lighter.</p>
