<p><strong>This morning</strong>, I heard the news of the murder of a young police officer.</p>
<p><img src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/ofcbrown.jpg" style="width:200px;height:280px;" align="left" border="0" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />Officer Norvelle Brown, only 22 years old and a rookie cop, made St. Louis headlines for the second time in his short career--his short, honorable life.&nbsp; In April, Officer Brown responded to a hostage situation during a barber shop robber, defusing the situation and apprehending the armed robbers. &nbsp; He and another officer received citations for that action.&nbsp; He had been out of the academy only 7 months at the time.</p>
<p>Last night, Officer Brown left his patrol car to investigate a group of people who were loitering in a vacant lot.&nbsp; No one knows the exact details leading to Brown's murder.&nbsp; We do know that the bullet that killed him missed his body armor, passing through both lungs.</p>
<p>Officer Brown was able to speak for a short time before he died.&nbsp; Police have not publicized his last words.&nbsp; I hope they were to his parents.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4090161&amp;version=2&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1" target="_blank">Fox2 News</a> online has more information.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.backstoppers.org/" target="_blank">Backstoppers </a>is an organization that takes care of first responders killed or disabled in the line of duty.&nbsp; If you have an extra dollar or two, they will put it to great use.&nbsp; For instance, within 24 hours, Officer Brown's family will get a visit from Backstoppers, along with a $5,000 check.&nbsp; Later, the Backstoppers will help the family with any additional needs related to their son's service and tragic death.</p>
<p><strong>That was this morning</strong>.&nbsp; Tonight, one of St. Louis's finest churches was destroyed in a fire that still roars on in the hot, humid air of August in St. Louis.&nbsp; The 125-year-old <a href="http://www.stalphonsuschgo.org/" target="_blank">St. Alphonsus Liguori "Rock" church </a>stood at 1118 North Grand, about 4 blocks south of Vashon High School where Officer Brown attended.&nbsp; The Rock church was beacon in the North St. Louis area.</p>
<p>My mood has been glum all day.&nbsp; It's glummer now.&nbsp; The heat wave that's plagued St. Louis for two weeks broke this evening.&nbsp; But the rain that damped the temperature seem more like tears from Heaven, mourning St. Louis's long, hot day.</p>
