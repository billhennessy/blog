<p>Catholic Bishop Tiny Muskens (make your own joke) says all Christians should <a href="http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=52928" target="_blank">refer to God only as "Allah</a>."  The Dutch bishop believes that surrendering to the Muslims is in the best interest of Christianity.</p>
<p>Thanks, but no thanks, Your Excellency.  Instead of that, how about if we call you "de-frocked" Bishop?</p>
<p>According to CWN:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dutch bishop admitted that his suggestion was not likely to gain widespread acceptance. But he predicted that within a century or two, Dutch Catholics would be addressing prayers to "Allah."</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.  That's because most of Europe is overrun with raghead terrorists.  Seventy years ago, he'd have boldly predicted that "in a year or two, Dutch Catholics will be calling the head of state 'Der Furor.'"</p>
<p>A lot of Catholics I know say that the Pope's motu proprio on the Latin Mass will drive people away from the church.  Good.  I hope it drives away Bishop Muskens and his ilk.  The church is peopled with too many idiots as it is, particularly in its rectories.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>:&nbsp; I thought I was the only person who saw this story, but <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2007/08/the-name-of-god.html" target="_blank">Professor Bainbridge</a> has an eloquent argument <em>against</em> calling God 'Allah.'</p>
