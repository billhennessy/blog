<p>According to a disturbing post on <a href="http://bamapachyderm.com/archives/2007/08/14/6555/" target="_blank">MY Vast Right Wing Conspiracy</a>, Beth is hanging up the . . . the . . . whatever it is bloggers use to ply their trade.</p>
<p>I'll take her at her word, but I'm not happy.&nbsp; For -- how many years? -- Beth's crisp, snappy, sarcastic, sometimes cynical, always lucid, and 100 percent on-the-money writing has made the little dramas of the news bearable.&nbsp; When I've been discouraged, Beth has picked me up.</p>
<p>I wish her all the best, and her thoughts are always welcome in my view.</p>
