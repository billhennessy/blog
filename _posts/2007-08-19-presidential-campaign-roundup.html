<p>We're still 15 months away from the next general election.&nbsp; Remember that.&nbsp; Getting groceries and taking the kids to hockey practice are more important.&nbsp; Two World Series separate us from the election, not to mention a season and a half of football, more than a year of&nbsp; school.&nbsp; A child born today will be talking and walking before the election.</p>
<p>That said, <a target="_blank" href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/08/18/thompson-on-running-we%e2%80%99ll-be-in/">Fred Thompson spoke to CNN</a> yesterday, and his remarks make interesting reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>He would work to overturn Roe v. Wade as President.&nbsp; That is pretty bold and unequivocal.&nbsp; Most Presidential candidates give only vaguely pro ("It's decided law.") or vagues con ("It's bad law.") on the subject.&nbsp; Few give a straight answer.</li>
<li>He would push for a Constitutional amendment permitting states to ignore gay marriage laws of other states.&nbsp; Here he's in the boat with President Bush and others, but this stance should help cement his standing with social conservatives.</li>
<li>He will announce his entry into the campaign shortly.&nbsp; In fact, in a statement on his website, he says that he will enter the race next month.</li>
<li>He is not surprised that people in Washington think he's "too lazy' to be president.&nbsp; He says that he will have more Washington detractors when the race is over.&nbsp; Good for him.</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/08/19/clinton-karl-rove-obsessed-with-me/">Hillary Clinton</a>, meanwhile, tells audiences about Karl Rove:&nbsp; ". . . he's so obsessed with me."&nbsp; Get over yourself, girl.&nbsp; Your husband isn't even obsessed with you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hillary might suffer from what Charles Horton Cooley called "<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_glass_self">the looking-glass self.</a>"</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/011647.php">Captain Ed Morrissey</a> delightfully examines John Edwards' rather blatant stupidity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a matter of hours, Edwards told reporters that Michael Moore's "Sicko" documentary about the wonders of Cuban socialized medicine was a great movie AND that he has no idea whether Cuba has a government-run healthcare system.&nbsp; Morrissey says the contradiction shows Edwards a lightweight.&nbsp; I say it shows him an idiot.&nbsp; BTW, have you noticed that Edwards mantra now is "change?"&nbsp; I guess he figured we need a white guy with a Southern accent in the White House.&nbsp; (In that case, I'll take Fred.)</p>
<p>Finally, <a target="_blank" href="http://themoderatevoice.com/politics/14628/barack-obama-will-turn-down-future-debates/">Barack Obama</a> has opted out of the remaining Democrat candidate forum that some call debates.&nbsp; Apparently his handlers realize that extemporaneous thinking isn't one of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,1,3868160.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true">magic negro's</a> strenghts.</p>
