<p>I was lying in the bathtub after a rare Sunday afternoon football practice when the Big Red post-game show was interrupted:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="#ffffff">We interrupt this program for a CBS Radio News special report.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff">I'm Morton Dean.&nbsp; The US State Department has announced that a group of students under control of the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran have siezed the American Embassy in Tehran, taking more than 100 Americans hostage.</font></p></blockquote>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It was <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis">November 4, 1979.</a>&nbsp; The action, as much as anything else, gave us Ronald Reagan for 8 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those of who lived through <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw">Jimmy Carter's inept management </a>of the crisis have longed for the end to the Islamic regime in Iran.&nbsp; We've studied the vast chasm of philosophy between the Iran's ruling despots and the Iranian people.&nbsp; We know that Iran could America's greatest ally in the Southwest Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we hear that<a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,2152325,00.html"> Iran is lobbing shells into Kurdish Iraq</a>, we want our government to declare war on Iran to liberate her people.</p>
<p>My God, I miss Reagan.</p>
