<p>A Democrat apparatchik named Lane Hudson has filed a <a target="_blank" href="http://newsfortheleft.blogspot.com/2007/08/fec-complaint-filed-against-fred.html">complaint </a>against Fred Thompson with the Federal Election Commission, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/08/20/post_29.html">WaPo</a>.</p>
<p>The lefty claims that Thompson is violating the law by operating like a candidate without declaring his candidacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hudson plans to file similar complaints against George Washington, who spent much of the Revolutionary War traveling through critical electoral states, like Pennsylvannia and New York, without declaring himself a candidate for President.&nbsp; "Not only was Washington&nbsp;campaigning illegally, he presided over the Constitutional Convention that created the job he would later seize,"&nbsp;Hudson said.&nbsp; Hudson hopes&nbsp;the FEC will overturn the&nbsp;results of the 1788 election, making Al Gore the first President of the United States and stimulating the dormant American History textbook business.</p>
<p>Clearly, this weasel needs something to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Sorry for linking to a moonbat blog, but the complaint <em>and</em> the moronic babble in the comments are funnier than Blazing Saddles.)</p>
<p><em>Update</em>:&nbsp; Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2007/08/cheers-jeers-fo.html">USAToday for the link</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>:&nbsp; Both of my regular readers will notice that I failed to lead the story with a dateline, as is my wont want when pieces contain satirical content.&nbsp; My oversight.&nbsp; It began as a series piece, but this Hudson guy is such a pathetic absurdity that satire seemed the only fitting style.&nbsp;</p>
