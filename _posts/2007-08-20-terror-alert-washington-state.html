<p>I got <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2007/08/20/seattle-washington-fbi-searching-for-suspicious-ferry-passengers/">this link</a>&nbsp;on <a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/08/fbi-searching-for-suspicious-ferry.html">GatewayPundit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FBI is asking for the public&rsquo;s help to identify two men who have been seen acting strangely aboard Washington State ferries recently.<br />
According to federal agents, passengers have seen the men on several occasions exhibiting unusual behavior. The FBI did not say precisely what that unusual</p></blockquote>
<p><font color="#cccccc">The Submarine Base at Bremerton&nbsp;is home to the Navy's Pacific fleet of Trident class submarines.&nbsp; I believe there is also a weapons station.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#cccccc">If these two are terrorists, their location is frighteningly similar to that of the <a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8123">Charleston</a>, South Carolina, terror suspects now in custody.&nbsp; The SC pair were nabbed only a couple of miles from Naval Weapons Station Charleston in July.</font></p>
<p><font color="#cccccc">Perhaps because I'm an old <a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8114">submariner</a>, I suspect everyone wants to sink a sub.&nbsp; Or maybe they saw that made for TV movie in the early 80s about terrorists detonating a nuke on a sub in <a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=8108">Charleston</a>.&nbsp; (Can't happen, but interesting concept.)The more I think about, the more I'm convinced that the Charleston pair are on a mission to study FBI techniques and methods</font></p>
<p><font color="#cccccc">National Terror Alert also has information on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2007/08/13/fbi-search-home-linked-to-goose-creek-pipe-bomb-arrests/">Charleston suspects</a>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; </font></p>
