    And the crickets chirped on...

    *Grin*

    If she keeps this up, maybe she'll do herself in.

<p>St. Louis, MO--Campaiging in Mooseknuckles, MO, today, Democrat Hillary Clinton gave supporters her strongest argument to date for an immediate, unconditional pull-out from Iraq.</p>
<p>"You read the news," she shrilled to the largely silent crowd.&nbsp; "You read the reports the coming out of Iraq.&nbsp; You know what's happened during George Bush's war!"</p>
<p>The audience's polite but blank silence indicated that they didn't.</p>
<p>"You have seen Senator Durbin and several Brookings Institute scholars report from the field that the surge is pushing back the insurgents."</p>
<p>She raised her right hand to quell the nascent cheers of the crowd.&nbsp; Wrong queue.</p>
<p>"If we don't begin a complete withdrawal immediately," Clinton yelled, "this war could be over!&nbsp; If America wins this war, you--you invisible people--you lose, &nbsp;because the Republicans will continue to keep all of you invisible."</p>
<p>The audience seemed confused, unsure whether Clinton's "invisible" line was an applause queue or not.&nbsp; But they smiled politely and fanned themselves with the carbon-neutral programs.&nbsp;</p>
