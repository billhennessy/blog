  content: Can you provide a link to an abhorrent view or story?  Just because a group
    openly discusses race issues.... doesn't mean they are racist.  It just means
    they aren't afraid to discuss issues in a politically incorrect manner.

    As a follow up - I have been reading their links for quite awhile now and they definetely do not shy away from discussing these issues...  I do not discuss these issues, but I do think there is a place for all views to be discussed.  I also think Liberals should be allowed to discuss their crazy viewpoints.

    That being said I have yet to see any articles on this website that call for overt segregation or suppression of race.

    Chris,

    I hope my post didn't give the impression that I want to suppress their speech.  I don't.  I just don't want to promote their web site.  I'm pretty sure that's call.  I don't link to Kos, DU, and a lot of other web sites.

    And while their blogs and sites might be relatively mild, their newspaper was a bit shocking.  I just don't want my name associated with the organization.

    Hard for me to comment on that as I haven't read or seen any newsletters.  Since I am trying to be open and balanced as much as possible I will link you on my page :)

    I wanted to promote discussion as much as possible, but haven't had that happen much yet.  The webmaster of the St Louis CofCC blog posts on my site quite a bit... you should come over and debate him sometime.

  content: 'I''ve e-mailed him.  Actually, he seems like a great guy.  I have no desire
    to debate him, though.  As I said, I''m sure we agree on most things: guns, taxes,
    welfare, military service, 10th Amendment, Christian foundings, etc.'

<p>Several weeks ago, I linked and blogged about an organization headquartered in St. Louis.&nbsp; I had never heard of it.&nbsp; The name of the outfit--Council of Conservative Citizens--sounded like something useful.&nbsp; After reading a few entries on the blog, I thought it sounded pretty good.</p>
<p>Today, though, I received their quarterly newsletter.&nbsp; I was a bit surprised by the number of stories about "blacks."&nbsp; As I continued to read, it was obvious that the editors of the paper hold racial views that I have no desire to be associated with.</p>
<p>I later learned tonight that prominent politicians have been excoriated for speaking at the group's gathering.  Reading more about the CofCC, I realized that I must disavow the organization's published views regarding race.</p>
<p>The organization might have views in common with mine.  I'm sure they do.  But they have very public views that I find abhorrent.</p>
<p>I apologize for sending readers to their sites, and I hope readers will forgive my lack of due diligence in studying the group's positions before linking.  </p>
