<p>For a couple of days, the wingnuts have been ecstatic over a story that Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Peter Pace would tell President Bush to cut Iraqi troop strength in half.&nbsp; I first heard the story on CBS Radio News Friday morning on my way to work.&nbsp; The<a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pace24aug24,0,43964.story?coll=la-home-center"> LA Times</a>, quoting anonymous Pentagon and Administration officials, printed the the story in its Friday edition.</p>
<p>But the story was a fabrication, likely designed to quell the growing support for the war.&nbsp; Late Friday, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294421,00.html">Pace denied</a> (FoxNews) the report.</p>
<p>The original LA Times story went to explain to readers that Pace's recommendation would be devastating to Bush, forcing him to pull out of Iraq.&nbsp; Clearly, Julian Barnes and Peter Spiegel, the authors, made up much of the story or failed to obtain corroboration from independent, reliable sources.</p>
<p>My beef is with the media's response to Pace's denial of the story's authenticity.&nbsp; Perhaps LA Times, the AP, and CBS News ran retractions or corrects.&nbsp; If they did, the corrections are well hidden.&nbsp; My <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22peter+pace%22+troop+cut&amp;btnG=Search">Googling </a>found that only Fox News (linked above)&nbsp;and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2435375620070824">Reuters</a>.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070824/ts_nm/iraq_usa_pace_dc">Yahoo! News&nbsp;</a>carried the Reuters retraction, but not in their Top News sections.&nbsp; Sadly, <a target="_blank" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/CC2F03C9-E6B5-46D1-8EE0-2B08190D8285.htm">al Jazeera</a> proves more honest than the AP, LA Times, Washington Post, ABC, MSNBC, and CBS, carrying the retraction in English.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/08/wrong-medias-story-on-gen-peter-pace.html">Gateway Pundit</a>, too, noticed the lack of retractions.</p>
<p>It amazes me that people, myself included, even bother to look&nbsp;to&nbsp;the MSM for information.&nbsp; Then, again, we scan the World&nbsp;News&nbsp;while in line at the&nbsp;grocery store.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
