<p>You'll be hearing that mantra from the left pretty soon because poverty rates are lower under Bush than they were under Clinton.&nbsp; That means the Republicans can look into the camera next fall and ask Americans, "Are you better off now than you were eight years ago."&nbsp; For those at the bottom of the econmic ladder, the answer must be, "Yes!"</p>
<p>Leftist economists still claim that supply side economics and stimulation through tax cuts&nbsp; are fantasies.&nbsp; They also claim that the rich get richer.&nbsp; Well, the poor get richer, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Census Bureau numbers prove it.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the AP headline screams "<a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070829/ap_on_re_us/poverty;_ylt=AmBk1dE0_heptyhemYHR.31vzwcF">pover rate declines significantly</a>," you know there's something to talk about, and <a target="_blank" href="http://theconservativepost.com/WordPress/?p=140">The Conservative Post </a>wastes no time starting the conversation.</p>
<p>Bush's tax cuts have resulted in large numbers of those who were just below the poverty line stepping over that line into lower-middle class.&nbsp; As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/012306.php">Captain Ed points out</a>, the details of the report show that poverty among seniors is at its lowest level since the Eisenhower administration--before Johnson's Great Society wealth confiscication schemes drove the old people to the poor house.&nbsp; I would also give some credit to welfare reform under Gingrich's Congress and Clinton's administration.&nbsp; While Clinton might have been brought kicking and screaming to the table, he had the courage to sign the legislation, which is, by far, the pinnacle of his legacy.</p>
<p>Moreover, this proves beyond reasonable argument that drug prices are not&nbsp;driving seniors into poverty.&nbsp; Instead, the less invasive treatment available through drug therapy is keeping seniors economically and physically active, improving their standards of living.</p>
<p>Liberals will demand a change to the way the Census Bureau calculates or defines poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The left wants lots and lots of poor people and lots more who think they're poor, because people who can help themselves never vote Democrat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next time you pass an empty&nbsp;street corner where a&nbsp; homeless bum used to be, thank a Republican:&nbsp; we're making everyone's life better.</p>
