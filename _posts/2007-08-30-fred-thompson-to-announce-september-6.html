<p><a href="http://www.imwithfred.com/Events/private/findevents_search_results.aspx"><img border="0" vspace="4" align="left" width="150" src="http://socialnet.imwithfred.com/widget_houseparty.gif" hspace="8" height="300" style="margin:4px 8px;width:150px;height:300px;border-width:0;" /></a>I guess this makes it semi-official. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imwithfred.com/">Fred Thompson</a> will announce his candidacy for President of the United States by <a target="_blank" href="http://fredfile.imwithfred.com/">WWW </a>on September 6.</p>
<p>Now, I've been blogging for Fred since there were only about a dozen and a half bloggers for Fred. All I'm saying is that, when he's trying to fill his Cabinet . . .</p>
<p>I expect his official entry to change the dynamics of the GOP race dramatically. The bottom tier will drop out. Newt Gingrich, apparently, will endorse Thompson. McCain will be in deep trouble, and I expect him to quit the race by the end of October.</p>
<p>What's more important is the people. As <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2007/07/26/leftist-attacks-on-thompson-not-working/">I've written before,</a> I believe that Thompson will energize a lot of people. I also believe Thompson is the only candidate or potential candidate who can create a wave and provide coat tails.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I'm jacked up over this. For the first time since 1988, I have a horse in the race.</p>
