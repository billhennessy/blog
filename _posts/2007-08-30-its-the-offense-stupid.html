<p>Since July, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?s=offense">I have been saying </a>that the surge is working because America is on offense instead of hunkering down on defense.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/012320.php">Captain's Quarters </a>found a Petraeus interview in which&nbsp;the HMFIC in Iraq confirms that it's not just the numbers, it's the attitude:</p>
<blockquote><p>How have things changed in Iraq? Petraeus compared the previous condition of Ramadi to Stalingrad. The general told the newspaper that having to stay on defense had taken its toll on American strength and had emboldened the enemy. Switching to offense has changed everything, and AQI simply cannot contend with a modern army with initiative on its side.</p></blockquote>
