<p>This gem of bad news for environmentalist wackos comes from the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&amp;ContentRecord_id=b35c36a3-802a-23ad-46ec-6880767e7966" target="_blank">U. S. Senate Committee on Environment &amp; Public Works</a> via Drudge:&nbsp; Fewer than half of all peer-reviewed scientists who have written on global warming endorse the idea of man-made global warming.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of 528 total papers on climate change, only 38 (7%) gave an explicit endorsement of the consensus. If one considers "implicit" endorsement (accepting the consensus without explicit statement), the figure rises to 45%. However, while only 32 papers (6%) reject the consensus outright, the largest category  (48%) are neutral papers, refusing to either accept or reject the hypothesis.  This is no "consensus."</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Al Gore and his idiot followers claim such a consensus exists.&nbsp; But the alarmists carefully select the scientists admitted into the room before they take the poll.</p>
<p>The report by Dr. Klaus Martin-Shulte uses the same data collection methodology as researcher Naomi Oreskes, whose 2004 report invented the myth of a "consensus."&nbsp;&nbsp; Shulte, however, used a more recent sampling:&nbsp; 2004 to 2007.</p>
<p>Now that we know the sun is hotter and we know that most scientists do not endorse the IPCC position (written wholly by politicians, not scientists, by the way), can we <em>please </em>stop talking about carbon credits? &nbsp; By the same token, would Al Gore please just go away?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Survey+Less+Than+Half+of+all+Published+Scientists+Endorse+Global+Warming+Theory/article8641.htm" target="_blank">Daily Tech</a> has more detail.</p>
<p>And the Senate Environment Committee has <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
