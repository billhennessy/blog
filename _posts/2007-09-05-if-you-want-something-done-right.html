<p>. . . you have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>That's the MSM's motto over the upcoming Patraeus report to Congress on progress in Iraq.</p>
<p>The <em>facts</em> are obvious:&nbsp; since the surge and offensive began, the terrorists in Iraq have become less effective.&nbsp; The surge and the offensive are working.&nbsp; Those who agree with this view inlude these liberals and Democrats:</p>

<p>I can't the MSM disagree, but I can say they don't care.&nbsp; They want America to lose the war, and they won't sit idly by while George Bush and the military go out and win this thing.</p>
<p>The MSM counted on the insurgents to stage massive attacks prior to the Patraeus report to Congress.&nbsp; So far, that hasn't happened.&nbsp; The MSN, particular through their Associated Press, have filled our heads with every negative story on Iraq they can find--even if they have to make them up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If mainstream reporters had any guts,&nbsp;they'd strapped bombs to themselves and detonated them up in malls. They'd join the terrorists outright in the war against Western Civilization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But these AP cowards are just that:&nbsp; cowards.&nbsp; They run gratuitous, negative statistics about Iraq and ONLY negative statistitics.&nbsp; They intentionally bury good news out of Iraq.&nbsp;&nbsp; They invent negative statistics when no one else will provide them.&nbsp; When nothing else works, they conduct a<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/16/poll.iraq.report/index.html?iref=newssearch"> slanted poll </a>attempting to prove that most American believe Patraeus's report is a lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we start a new service for people who don't hate America?</p>
