<p>St. Louis--A CNN/Time Magazine/Al-Jazeera poll of 1,098 ineligible voters finds that Illinois Democrat Barack Obama would be the next president of the United States were the election confined to non-voters.&nbsp;The ineligible groups polled included the mentally ill, children, and convicted felons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among high school students, Obama trounced second-place candidate Hillary Clinton 62 percent to 14 percent. &nbsp; &nbsp;The mentally ill, including schizophrenics and victims of head trauma, gave Barack a slight advantage over Democrat Dennis Kucinich 34 to 32 with Joe Biden of Maryland finishing a close third. &nbsp;North Carolina Senator and former Vice President candidate John Edwards polled best among convicts, edging out Obama 42-38.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Clinton campaign put a positive spin on the seemingly disappointing results, explaining that Hillary's criminal support comes from white-collar criminals crafty enough to avoid both conviction and extradition. &nbsp;"Proud criminals like Norman Hsu put their money where their warrant is," said Clinton campaign chief Terry McAuliffe. &nbsp;"Frankly, Senator Clinton wouldn't want the support of anyone stupid enough to get arrested, much less convicted." &nbsp;</p>
<p>The poll was conducted by telephone and through a 3/4 inch plexiglass divider from August 28 through August 30. &nbsp;The poll has an error of margin of +/- 6.8 percent. &nbsp;</p>
