    They don't deserve you, nor do they deserve my dad (who served in the US Navy for 12 years), my brother, who currently serves, or my other relatives and friends who have fought, bled and/or died for them.

    I seem to recall a certain group of celebrities promising to leave the country if Bush were to be re-elected.  They're still here because...?

<p>It breaks my heart to write these words.</p>
<p>I spent 11 years in the U.S. Navy. I thought the long hours, the humiliation, the lousy pay, and missing the 1980s was worth it. I thought my country appreciated our work.</p>
<p>Apparently, I was wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1354">Zogby Poll</a>: 51% of Americans Want Congress to Probe Bush/Cheney Regarding 9/11 Attacks; Over 30% Seek Immediate Impeachment</p></blockquote>
<p>If I believed&nbsp;this poll&nbsp;be accurate, I really wouldn't want to be an American any longer. If fifty-one percent of the people in this country believe that our president killed 3,000 people on September 11, 2001,&nbsp;simply so he could spend the remaining seven years of his presidency fighting a war with al Qaeda, then the majority of Americans don't deserve to have me, my dad, and the millions of others who served as their fellows. We are too good for them.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brightandearlyblog.com/2007/09/it-is-really-this-simple/">Jim Lynch has a message </a>for you 51 percent who blame George Bush for 9/11 have a choice to make:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two solutions to stopping it. One is from our side, and it is to escalate the fighting and killing against you. This is our duty, and our brothers are carrying it out," bin Laden said, according to the transcript.</p>
<p>"The second solution is from your side," he said. "I invite you to embrace Islam."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's from the guy who actually&nbsp;flew planes into buildings.&nbsp; The guy you blame is the guy trying to save your wretched, misspent lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what will it be, Democrat: Islam?&nbsp; Death?</p>
