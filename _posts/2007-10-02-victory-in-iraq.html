<p>Tell everyone Hennessy broke the story. &nbsp;<a href="#mce_temp_url#">America won the Iraq war</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The insurgency is broken! &nbsp;Peace prevails. &nbsp;The terrorists are routed!Where are the headlines? &nbsp;A man between the ages of 18 and 30 has a better chance of being murdered in&nbsp;<a href="#mce_temp_url#">Philadelphia</a>than of dying in Iraq in September. &nbsp;The third head of al Qaeda in Iraq is dead--three in 18 months. &nbsp;Ascending to that throne is no promotion.&nbsp;Face it, folks, we won the war. &nbsp;We won the peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Face this, too: &nbsp;the average American is too stupid to know the difference, so she votes Democrat and makes Bush jokes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
