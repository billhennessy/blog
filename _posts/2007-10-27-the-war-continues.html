<p>We have won the war in Iraq, but the war against rag-head extremists continues. &nbsp;One reason I hate liberals is that they don't get stories like this one from CNN:<br />
<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;line-height:21px;text-align:left;" class="Apple-style-span"><strong>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)</strong> -- U.S.-led coalition forces killed about 80 Taliban fighters during a six-hour battle outside a Taliban-controlled town in southern Afghanistan Saturday, the latest in a series of increasingly bloody engagements in the region, officials said.</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;line-height:15px;text-align:left;" class="Apple-style-span"><img src="http://i.l.cnn.net/cnn/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/27/afghanistan.violence.ap/art.kabul.ap.jpg" border="0" height="219" width="292" alt="art.kabul.ap.jpg" /></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;line-height:21px;text-align:left;" class="Apple-style-span">A man stands on the roof of his home and looks out over the city of Kabul, Afghanistan, at sunset Saturday.</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;line-height:15px;text-align:left;" class="Apple-style-span"><img src="http://www.cnn.com/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/baseplate/corner_wire_BL.gif" height="4" width="4" /></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;line-height:21px;text-align:left;" class="Apple-style-span">Also Saturday, suicide bomber wearing an Afghan security uniform detonated his explosives at the entrance to a combined U.S.-Afghan base in the east of the country, killing four Afghan soldiers and a civilian, officials said.</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;line-height:21px;text-align:left;" class="Apple-style-span">The battle near Musa Qala in Helmand province -- the world's largest poppy growing region -- is at least the fifth major fight in the area since September 1. The five battles have killed more than 250 Taliban fighters, a possible sign that U.S. or British forces could be trying to wrest the area back from Taliban militants.</span><span style="color:#000000;line-height:28px;text-align:left;" class="Apple-style-span"><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:12px;line-height:21px;" class="Apple-style-span">The latest fight began when Taliban fighters attacked a combined U.S. coalition and Afghan patrol with rockets and gunfire, prompting the combined force to call in attack aircraft, which resulted in "almost seven dozen Taliban fighters killed," the U.S.-led coalition said in a statement early Sunday.</span>&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
