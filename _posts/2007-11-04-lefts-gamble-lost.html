<p>From 2004 through about September 12, the American and European left bet the farm on terrorists.</p>
<p>Here's Dick Durbin, the anti-American from Illinois, in September:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a speech Friday at the Center for National Policy, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said, "President Bush is preparing to tell the nation, once again, that his strategy in Iraq is succeeding. We know what the Bush-Petraeus report will say: The surge is working. Be patient. The reality is despite heroic efforts by U.S. troops, the Bush surge is not working. . . "By carefully manipulating the statistics, the Bush-Petraeus report will try to persuade us that violence in Iraq is decreasing and thus the surge is working." (<a target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3575785&amp;page=1">source)</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Senate Majority Leader (and heed that title) Harry Reid declared defeat in April:</p>
<blockquote><p>this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything as indicated by the extreme violence in Iraq yesterday," said Reid. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/20/politics/main2709229.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_2709229">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>But don't stop there.&nbsp; Google your way through the left's treatment of&nbsp;war in July, August, and September.&nbsp; Note the&nbsp;glee&nbsp;with which the writers reported every American soldier's death and dismemberment.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the joy in Nancy Pelosi's eyes when she discusses&nbsp;roadside bombs.&nbsp; August 2007&nbsp;marks the Democrat&nbsp;Party's irrevocable pact with the devil.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Things have changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the US and her allies have defeated the terrorists in Iraq, the left is mum.&nbsp; Democrats, for example, will not permit talk of the war in Iraq mention in the House or Senate.&nbsp; The leftist media no longer mentions Bush's war, for Bush's war, always a just cause, is now a victorious&nbsp; campaign.</p>
<p>The Times of London (h/t <a target="_blank" href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/015816.php">Captain's Quarters</a>), not exactly a right-wing blog, noticed the absence of news from Iraq.&nbsp; But if you dig deeply into America's most anti-American media, you'll find that even the New York Times cannot hide all of the truth all of the time.&nbsp; From the Lede:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back in <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/watching-the-iraq-hearings-day-2/">September</a>, General David Petraeus reported a slide in violence that had some impressed and others saying that it might be a fluke. About two months later, many more are acknowledging progress, and <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/bin-laden-tape-drop-in-iraq-violence/">Osama bin Laden</a> sounds like one of them.</p>
<p>Adding to the optimism are news stories anticipating <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1031/p01s01-usmi.html">the lowest American death toll since early 2006</a>. If the toll remains at 23 - and that won't be a sure thing until several days after the month is over and the military finishes its October announcements - that would be a drop of 97 U.S. deaths from the month of May.</p>
<p>Even an alarming Pentagon estimate on a quadrupling of sniper attacks <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/10/pentagon-sniper.html">turned out to be very wrong</a>. Indeed, sniper attacks have dropped. (<a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/seizing-the-slide-in-iraq-violence/?hp">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>And remember the GAO's propaganda attack on General Petraeus released just before his Congressional testimony?&nbsp; Well, the NYT buries an update that discuss the remarkable progress in the war.</p>
<blockquote><p>Exactly two months after its <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/a-more-pessimistic-report-on-iraq/">pessimistic report to Congress</a>, the Government Accountability Office began a new report on a positive note. "Since G.A.O. last reported in September 2007," the report said, "the number of enemy attacks in Iraq has declined."</p></blockquote>
<p>As this blog has maintained for a month, the war is over and the liberals lost.&nbsp; If only, now, America had an unbiased media who would report the truth.&nbsp;</p>
