<p>I know it's late, but I was busy today. &nbsp;Busy doing what other veterans do: &nbsp;work. &nbsp;Unlike many others--from WWII to Iraq and Afghanistan--I am physically unscathed and mentally better off than I was in November 1984. &nbsp;That's when I left St. Louis MEPS for Navy Recruit Training Center, Orlando. &nbsp;Military life is military, but the submarine force ain't bad duty, if you can get it. &nbsp;I got it. &nbsp;The Cold War was fun -- sort of. &nbsp;At least we were doing something important for the $500 every two weeks they paid us. &nbsp;And were working for a great, great man in President Ronald Reagan. &nbsp;God, how I loved that man.Enough about me. &nbsp;My nephew, John, is on the USS Ronald Reagan. &nbsp;He's in harm's way frequently. &nbsp;Not as directly as the thousands of men and women with boots on the ground in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia. &nbsp;Did you know that we're still in Bosnia? &nbsp;When some wise-ass lefty asks when Bush will get the troops out of Iraq, are you tempted to answer, "Right after Clinton gets them out of Bosnia?" &nbsp; I am. &nbsp;Why doesn't Hillary's campaign plant that question with a student or a reporter?If you're reading this and you wear a uniform or wore one, God bless you. &nbsp;We at home eagerly await your return. &nbsp;We hope the last leg has been lost, the last life shortened, the last terrorifying night erased by God's morning light. &nbsp;We pray that your families find peace each day, especially on the day that peace finds you here where you belong.We also know that supporting you means supporting your mission. &nbsp;Just as we hope our favorite hockey player avoids injury, we cheer for him to win, too. &nbsp;I am your fan. &nbsp;You have a lot more than me. &nbsp;In fact, the lefties who cheer for the enemy are very few. &nbsp;And they're concentrated in press rooms, television and movie studios, and colleges. They're not here among the patriots.Last, please hurry home. &nbsp;Win one more for the Gipper. &nbsp;You know that right now, he's there with you, in the sand, his head cocked to the right, his lips pulling back as if he's battling to suppress a joke that, if told, will offend the media. &nbsp;Then he tells it anyway. &nbsp;Win one for your family. &nbsp;Mom and dad, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, kids and friends. &nbsp;They love you and cheer your great successes. &nbsp;They can't wait to throw arms around you and embarrass you by telling strangers of your heroic victory against heathen sons of bitches. &nbsp;Be proud, though, because you earned it. &nbsp;And when you get home, we'll have a drink. &nbsp;The ones, like me, who had an easy road will buy a round for you who didn't. &nbsp;</p>
