<p>Has everyone missed the real story behind the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/06/iran.nie/index.html?section=cnn_latest" target="_blank">National Intelligence Assessment</a> of Iranian nukes?</p>
<p>Conservatives, like <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_120607/content/01125107.guest.html" target="_blank">Rush Limbaugh</a> and <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/12/04/president-bush-faces-the-press-and-congress/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a>, are doing back-bends to convince us that Iran is still a nuclear threat.  Fine.  I won't argue that point.  But a much larger story here looms, and everyone is missing it.</p>
<p>Iran's reported abandonment of it nuclear weapons drive coincides with the United States' invasion of Iraq!</p>
<p>Make it a headline.</p>
<p>Libya capitulated when Bush nutted up and invaded Iraq.  So did Iran. The Intelligence Assessment validates the Bush Doctrine.</p>
