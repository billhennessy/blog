<p>From <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/28/huckabee.foreign.policy/index.html">CNN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A senior aide to Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee admitted Friday that the former Arkansas governor had "no foreign policy credentials" after his comments reacting to the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto raised questions.</p></blockquote>
<p>When a candidate's senior aide admits the candidate knows nothing about the world beyond Arkansas, USA, the voters must take the aide seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A vote for Huckabee might be more un-American than a vote for a Democrat.&nbsp; Either is vote for America's collapse, but at least the Democrats <em>know</em> they'll cause our downfall.&nbsp; Huckabee's just plain clueless.&nbsp; The guy can't point out Cananda on a map of Canada.</p>
<p>Previously, Huckabee was unaware of the National Intelligence Assessment that concluded Iran suspended its nuke program in 2003.&nbsp; He also thought Pakistan was west of Afghanistan, so don't let him drive.&nbsp; <!--startclickprintexclude--><!-- PURGE: /2007/POLITICS/12/28/huckabee.foreign.policy/art.huckabee.iowa.ap.jpg --><!-- KEEP --></p>
