<p>Mike Huckabee's recent ascent through the polls is about to reverse itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking through <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/12/huckabee_slipping.html">RealClearPolitics </a>news stories and polls, I saw a pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huckabee says something stupid</li>
<li>Romney fires off attack ads on Huckabee</li>
<li>Huckabee makes something up that might not be true</li>
<li>Romney fires off attack ads on Huckabee</li>
<li>Huckabee attacks Romney's ads</li>
<li>Repeat until sick</li>
</ul>
<p><!--adsense#banner--><br />
Let's&nbsp;assume that people in Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, and the Palmetto State are not sadists who pick a candidate based primarily upon his or her ability to insult and impugn opponents.&nbsp; While negative advertising works well in politics, it works better between parties than within them.&nbsp; With McCain now attacking Romney, we can fairly safely predict</p>
<ul>
<li>The negative ads against Huckabee will hurt him badly, especially since they're corroborated by Huckabee's international ignorance and questionable honesty</li>
<li>The negative ads against Romney will prevent him from gaining from Huckabee's demise</li>
<li>McCain's numbers are locked in, just as they were in 1999-2000</li>
<li>Voters are tired of candidates whose last names end with a long "ee" sound (or maybe that's just me)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2007/12/28/huckabee-slammed-by-senior-aide/">Huckabee's credibility </a>on foreign policy is dead, and his reputation for honesty isn't too healthy.&nbsp; In addition to his inexcusable gaffes about Pakistan, <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/016467.php">Ed Morrissey </a>points to a <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1207/7602.html">Politico </a>report in which Huckabee told reporters that former UN Ambassador John Bolton agreed to join his team.&nbsp; Bolton, however, denied that he'd even spoken to Huckabee's team.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.californiaconservative.org/military/mitts-major-misstep/#more-5407">California Conservative</a> points to another recent gaffe of Huckbee's, in which he seemed to indicate that foreign policy is not important since a president can "pluck out one of the tens of thousands of people who work" in the State Department.&nbsp; That's like saying a cancer patient can simply grab any of the 500 employees of Barnes-Jewish Hospital to treat his disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WE are told that conservative Christians powered Huckabee's recent rise.&nbsp; If true, then the beneficiary of his demise will have to be a social conservative and, likely, a Christian.&nbsp; That eliminates Romney (Morman), Giuliani (social liberal), McCain (unclear social position) from the displaced voter pool.&nbsp; This might be wishful thinking, but Thompson would stand to gain the lion's share of disheartened Huckabee voters.</p>
<p>Another point in Thompson's favor is his below-the-radar position.&nbsp; By avoiding negativity, Thompson has lost the free advertising the others have enjoyed, but he's also avoided foreign object damage from negative ads aimed his way.&nbsp; If Thompson can use his recent fund raising success to present himself as a positive, conservative alternative to the mudslingers, empty suits, and liberals, he could score a big surprise in Iowa.</p>
<p>Whatever Thompson's fate, Huckabee is done.&nbsp; Republicans may not list foreign policy as their top criterion, but they will not nominate a foreign policy lightweight who lies.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2007/12/29/politics/fromtheroad/entry3656127.shtml">CBS News </a>has found at least one Iowa voter who is switching from Huckster to Thompson because of Huckabee's foreign policy blunders:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could Huckabee&rsquo;s lack of foreign policy experience be hurting him in Iowa? It made the difference tonight for at least one voter at a Fred Thompson event in Fort Madison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a Huckabee supporter until about a week ago,&rdquo; said Brian Wright, a Fort Madison resident. &ldquo;And then I heard his comment about Pakistan today.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Candidate switchers are like mice--if you see one, there's a whole bunch you haven't seen.</p>
