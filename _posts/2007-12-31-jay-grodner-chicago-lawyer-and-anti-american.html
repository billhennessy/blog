    You would not believe the tree-huggers in my neighbors who believe it's impossible for a politician to create a bad environment for his constituents by preaching anti-war hate rhetoric.

    If you want to check it out, they're in the comments section.

<p>&nbsp;***Clarification:&nbsp; My comment about Chicago doesn't read the way it sounded in my head.&nbsp;Chicago's&nbsp;one of my favorite cities, and the people are&nbsp;generally great.&nbsp; My point was that it votes&nbsp;way to the left of the country&nbsp;as a&nbsp;whole.&nbsp; Way.&nbsp; Sorry to my Chicago friends.&nbsp; It's still a great town.***</p>
<p>Everyone is blogging about this asshat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackfive had it first.&nbsp; For my part, I've e-mailed him the message below.&nbsp; I want to buy him a custom-made t-shirt&nbsp;to show off to his friends.&nbsp; I'm open to ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:jayrg8@aol.com">jayrg8@aol.com</a><br />
Subj:&nbsp;Keying a Marine's Car</p>
<p align="left">Mr. Grodner,</p>
<p>I just read about your petty liberal hate crime against a U.S. Marine.</p>
<p>I hope you've had time to reflect on the immaturity and criminality of your despicable act.&nbsp; I hope you have come to realize that the worst Marine garners more admiration and respect from decent people than does the noblest lawyer.&nbsp; I hope you are embarrassed for your crime, and I hope your family is duly humiliated by sharing a name and genes with you.</p>
<p>This publicity might help your practice: Chicago is filled with brainless liberals who couldn't point to the United States on a map of the United States.&nbsp; But I hope it forces you into a new line of work.&nbsp; I hope your current clients bail and prospective client shun.</p>
<p>If you find yourself out of work, I understand the Marine Corps recruiting offices would be happy to talk to you about opportunties to serve your country.&nbsp; You'll get more satisfaction out of that than out of serving yourself.</p>
<p align="left">Cordially,<br />
Bill Hennessy</p></blockquote>
