<p>Liberalism is cultural treason.</p>
<p>Past US wars have spawned heroes.&nbsp; Generations honored them.&nbsp; I came of age in the 1980s, but I was well aware of men like Audey Murphy, Ted Knight, Doolittle, Patton, the men of Iwo Jima, the Baton Death March.&nbsp; These great men shaped our understanding of what it means to be a man.</p>
<p>Liberalism, though, has robbed my sons of such heroes.&nbsp; At least, it's made their task of learning about these heroes much more difficult.&nbsp; In 1945, the&nbsp; names of great warriors sat on the lips of every American.&nbsp; Today, only their families, friends, and conservative bloggers know.</p>
<p>The name Margo Martinez&nbsp;should be as familiar as Brittney Spears.&nbsp; <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/12/american-hero-marco-martinez-recipient.html">Gateway Pundit </a>has a terrific story about Cpl. Martinez, USMC, his book, and his heroics.&nbsp; I ordered his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307383040?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307383040">Hard Corps: From Gangster to Marine Hero</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307383040" style="border:medium none;margin:0;" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, today, for myself and my kids.</p>
<p>But American liberals have no time for heroes, only for scoundrels.&nbsp; Search Marco Martinez on MSNBC, CNN, ABCNews.com, CBSNews.com, even FoxNews.com, and you get nothing about the Marine.&nbsp; Liberals celebrate only two kinds of soldier:&nbsp; treasonous and dead.&nbsp; Martinez is neither.</p>
<p>Martinez is only one example of great Americans fighting valiently in Iraq and Afghanistan who are, at best, shunned by liberals.&nbsp; More often, they're ridiculed and reviled.</p>
<p>The long-term implications of liberalism's anti-Americanism frightens.&nbsp; As&nbsp;more generations&nbsp;separate our children from&nbsp;World War II--the last war with celebrated heroes--our heroic ideal will become further disordered.&nbsp; Movie stars and singers, athletes and criminals earn more admiration&nbsp;with each passing year.&nbsp; And if that trend doesn't happen, the media will stop running polls on the subject.</p>
<p>For example, name the only major media outlet that carried this year's <a href="http://catch22.newsvine.com/_news/2007/12/27/1188634-most-admired-woman-and-man-in-america-hillary-clinton-and-george-w-bush">Gallup poll of Most Admired Person</a>?&nbsp; Associated Press? No.&nbsp; Reuter's?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; CNN?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Try <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=bad42040-bac6-47c1-9e7f-9cee361b64db&amp;&amp;Headline=Bush%2c+Hillary+Clinton+most+admired+in+US">HindustanTimes.com</a>.&nbsp; (And, of course, conservative blogs.)&nbsp; Why did the other media not mention the poll?&nbsp; Because the most admired person in America is none other than our commander-in-chief, George W. Bush.&nbsp; (A few news services reported that Hillary Clinton was the most admired woman.&nbsp; She was light years behind Bush, though, in the polling.)</p>
<p>If the liberals have their way, 20 years from now our most admired list will include rapists, drug dealers, and pregnant 16-year-old child TV stars.&nbsp; No society can survive such hideous cultural treason.</p>
<p>***UPDATE***</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2007/12/anti-military-l.html">Blackfive's story </a>about a liberal vandalizing a Marine's automobile demonstrates the mentality and maturity of the folks on the left.&nbsp; The liberal in question, by the way, is a Chicago lawyer.&nbsp; Perhaps the Illinois Supreme Court should screen its bar-applicants a bit more carefully.</p>
