<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/gtemps2.gif" title="gtemps2.gif"><img align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/gtemps2.thumbnail.gif" alt="gtemps2.gif" /></a>Despite the Nobel committee's best efforts, 2007 turned out to be a bad year for global warming hoaxters.&nbsp; Global, 2007 was the <a href="http://www.longrangeweather.com/Long-Range-Weather-Trends.htm">coolest since 2001</a>.&nbsp; The 387 category 5 hurricanes predicted to strike Miami in&nbsp; at the rate of 3 per day until every (non-white) man, woman, and child was dead never happened.</p>
<p>In a glorious NYT op-ed, John Tierney lambastes the leftist, the global warming fearmongers, the idiot soccer moms who accept the non-science of greenhouse effect as readily as they accept their mediocre offspring are genetically superior any other nineteen human beings put together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today&rsquo;s interpreters of the weather are what social scientists call availability entrepreneurs: the activists, journalists and publicity-savvy scientists who selectively monitor the globe looking for newsworthy evidence of a new form of sinfulness, burning fossil fuels.<br />
A year ago, British meteorologists made headlines predicting that the buildup of greenhouse gases would help make 2007 the hottest year on record. At year&rsquo;s end, even though the British scientists reported the global temperature average was not a new record &mdash; it was actually lower than any year since 2001 &mdash; the BBC confidently proclaimed, &ldquo;2007 Data Confirms Warming Trend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Arctic sea ice last year hit the lowest level ever recorded by satellites, it was big news and heralded as a sign that the whole planet was warming. When the Antarctic sea ice last year reached the highest level ever recorded by satellites, it was pretty much ignored. A large part of Antarctica has been cooling recently, but most coverage of that continent has focused on one small part that has warmed [<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/01/science/01tier.html?ex=1356930000&amp;en=852a381c6d1a9297&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">source</a>].</p></blockquote>
<p>I expect activists who earn degrees to continue their activism.&nbsp; It's the layman, adequately educated through our tax system, loans, and generous parents, that I can't stand.&nbsp; It's the smug forty-year-old who knows how to amass a million dollars in retirement savings but refuses to subject global warming theories to his own scientific inquiry.&nbsp; It's this ordinary American idiot that gives the global warming hoax its legs.</p>
<p>The worst news of all for the 2008 is the election, because these idiots I write of vote.</p>
