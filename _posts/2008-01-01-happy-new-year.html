<p>I hope 2008 is the best year yet . . . for all of us.</p>
<p>Most particularly, may our men in women in uniform continue to fight their good fight, kick the enemy's ass, and catch a non-stop home to have a celebratory beer with us.</p>
<p>We miss you kids, but we thank God you're doing His work on our behalf.</p>
