<p><a href="http://controlcongress.com/uncategorized/thompson-endorses-mccain" target="_blank">Control Congress</a> carried a rumor, today, that appears to have no legs.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was watching the Morning Joe and they claim the rumor is out that if Thompson does badly in Iowa he may pull out and endorse McCain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether or not McCain or Thompson might, at campaign's end, recommend their supporters to one or the other remains a possibility.&nbsp; <em><strong>But I seriously doubt this rumor came from inside Thompson's campaign.</strong></em></p>
<p>First, Fred Thompson is still aggressively raising cash.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/02/the-fred-surge/" target="_blank">Fred is surging</a> in Iowa.&nbsp; He could peak at exactly the right time to build momentum for upcoming states.</p>
<p>Third, this story does not have legs.&nbsp; I have found no other references except for Control Congress.</p>
<p>Finally, sources I trust who are close to the campaign&nbsp; say they've heard nothing of this rumor, nor of potential endorsement talk.</p>
<p>More likely, this rumor came form McCain hopefuls trying to leverage the Arizona Senator's numbers in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>If all goes well, Fred's next endorsement will go to his running mate.</p>
