<p>Just as Fred Thompson's campaign started to take off, a loose conspiracy of MSM and bloggers seems determined to bring him down.</p>
<p>As I blogged last night, a single rumor on <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/02/what-endorsement/" target="_blank">Control Congress</a>, which seemed implausible, turned into a major story today--the day of the Iowa Cauci.</p>
<p>Apparently, the anti-Thompson forces were spooked by his surge in the polls in Iowa and decided to employ one of the dirtiest tricks in politics:&nbsp; the withdrawal rumor.&nbsp; Issued at the right moment--early enough to reach voters, too late for effective denial--the rumor that Candidate X is about drop out of a race can be devastating.</p>
<p>Today's barrage began (for me) with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119932738769464091.html?mod=politics_primary_hs" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a noncandidate, Fred Thompson could command the Tonight Show with Jay Leno to  deliver his political message. Now, the would-be savior of the conservative  coalition can barely get coverage from the Des Moines Register.</p></blockquote>
<p>WSJ could have saved a lot of space by simply admonishing voters, "Don't bother wasting your vote on Fred."&nbsp;&nbsp; Bastards.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/03/fred-thompsons-non-denial-denial/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a> aimed her own talented pen point at the Thompson balloon, advancing the withdrawal rumor I blogged about last night, linking to <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=3D9BF000-3048-5C12-00F70B89AC99625A" target="_blank">Politico </a>and <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/01/03/politico-sources-expect-fred-to-drop-out-this-weekend-unless-he-finishes-a-strong-third-tomorrow/" target="_blank">Hot Air</a> stories, and quoting J<a href="The FredHeads didn&rsquo;t see it that way, of course. In their view Fred should be able to just skip this whole election nonsense and go directly to the coronation ceremony. Fortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Most of us want a President who doesn&rsquo;t think its &ldquo;pandering&rdquo; to actually care what we think. " target="_blank">oe Carter, a Huckster</a>, who cashed in any conservative credentials he might have had to campaign for Huey Long II:</p>

<p>Kiss my ass, Joe.</p>
<p>Until yesterday, I supported Fred because he's the best man for the job.&nbsp; Today, it's personal.&nbsp; I pray that Thompson shocks the world just to shove a political sock in Joe Carter's mouth.</p>
<p>I must say I am mystified by Michelle Malkin.&nbsp; Did she not realize that she fired at Thompson with ammo supplied by the Huckabee campaign?&nbsp; I mean, she didn't have even try to qualify Joe Carter's spiteful rant.&nbsp; What give, Michelle?</p>
