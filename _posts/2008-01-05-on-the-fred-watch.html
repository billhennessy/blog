<p>Today is the Wyoming Republican caucus.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I know no one from Wyoming, though I do have a few business acquaintances from Montana.&nbsp;&nbsp; My cousin Bob lived in Wyoming for a few years after college, from whence he hitch-hiked to St. Louis for the annual Hennessy St. Patrick's Day party at Uncle Jim's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have no one to appeal to directly, I hope some Wyomingites stumple upon my humble blog and decide to wander to their county convention and cast a vote for conservatism in the person of Fred Thompson.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/05/what-about-wyoming/">Michelle Malkin </a>posts some interesting facts and projections about the Wyoming event.&nbsp; She points to <a href="http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWMyMjVhYjE0ZDM0MWUzNzY2NWY5ZjUzMmUwNzAxMGI=">Jim Geraghty's </a>prediciton of 2 delegates for Thompson.&nbsp; Perhaps the good folks to my west will upset that prediction with 3 or 4 for Fred.&nbsp; Maybe then the MSM and FoxNews will prove me right by giving Fred some publicity for his surge in Iowa.</p>
<p>Sean Hackbarth, posting on Fred08.com, provides some <a target="_blank" href="http://fredfile.fred08.com/blog/2008/help-fred-thompson-in-wyoming/">logistics for any Fredheads </a>who'd like help in Wyoming today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the Red Truck is back on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fred08.com/">Fred's homepage</a>.&nbsp; The post-Christmas Blog Burst for Iowa helped drive the surge there.&nbsp; Half a million for South Carolina will turn Fred's 3rd place finish into a Win for the one viable,&nbsp;solid, Reagan conservative in the GOP field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fred08.com/contribute.aspx?RefererID=4987be96-4295-4dda-be05-236f28ab766f"> can donate here</a>, and tell your friends.&nbsp; Anyone who supports Fred but hasn't coughed up some cash, please do so now.&nbsp; South Carolina could be the <a target="_blank" href="http://tennesseansforthompson.blogspot.com/2008/01/south-carolina-is-thompsons-opportunity.html">make-or-break </a>state for Fred.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/bill-hobbs/2008/01/04/politico-continues-hatchet-job-fred-thompson">Newsbusters </a>has more on <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/04/politico-waste-of-zeroes-and-ones/">Politico's all-out warfare </a>against Fred Thompson.&nbsp; Give Bill Hobbs high marks for using the right word to describe Politico "reporters":</p>
<blockquote><p>Politico reporter Roger Simon recently <strong>lied </strong>in The Politico about an incident at an Iowa fire hall involving Sen. Thompson and a fire helmet - an "error" that The Politico has never corrected even though video of the event clearly exposed the error.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's right.&nbsp; Politico is a pack of liars.&nbsp; They should work for <a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/02/ex-nbc-journalist-explains-why-nbc-news-sucks/">MSNBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to help is to make phone calls for Fred.&nbsp; On Fred08.com, you can<a href="http://www.fred08.com/grassroots/start.aspx"> call South Carolina, Florida, or New Hampshire </a>Republicans to remind them to vote for Fred.&nbsp; It's easy and a great chance to help conservatism.&nbsp; I just spent an hour with people in South Carolina.&nbsp;</p>
