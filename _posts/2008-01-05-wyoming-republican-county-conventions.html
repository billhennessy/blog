  content: "The Republican Party is a sick joke, and the people of this country are
    fed up with them. \nFrom Nixon to Bush, and from Scooter to Larry \"Toilet Stall\"
    Craig, the Republicans have proven themselves to be a bunch of lying, corrupt,
    evil, perverted, over-spending crooks. \nWhen you look at all the money Bill Clinton
    left this country, it makes us all cry to know that Bush spent it all. \nWhen
    the money was gone, Bush went to China for help. \nJust think, we owe money to
    China! \nThat is the Bush way. \nCheney is no better. \nYou can't trust either
    of them. \nNo one does. \nWhy are we in Iraq? \nThe war should be on terror, not
    in Iraq. \nIraq had nothing to do with 9/11, and yet Bush has spent all that money
    to fight \"his\" war. \nYes his, because many Republicans have backed off from
    the war. \nBy the way, the war in Iraq has cost the U.S. almost five hundred billion
    dollars. \nForget Rudy. \nRudy Giuliani is no hero. \nWhile he is often called
    the hero of 9/11, the truth is that Rudy was a terrible leader during his years
    as mayor of New York City. \nHe made bad decisions and took a girlfriend while
    being married. \nIn fact, he even wanted his lover to live in the same house with
    his wife. \nMost people would call this perverted. \nNew Yorkers were so sick
    of his antics, that they wanted him out of office. \nThen came 9/11. \nThe only
    reason people call Giuliani a hero today, is because he just happened to be NYC's
    mayor during that bad time. \nAny mayor would be looked at as a hero if they showed
    their face under those circumstances. \nIf there was no 9/11, Rudy would have
    become a joke. \nThis is not the kind of leader we want in the White House. In
    closing, the New York Post reported in their paper on April 23, that Giuliani
    spent more than $48,000 dollars of campaign money on posh hotels while claiming
    to have spent the least of all the Republican candidates. \nRudy is a good time
    leader, and does it with other people's money. \nForget Mitt. \nHis ads look bad.
    \nHe can't seem to get his facts right, and will say things to make himself look
    good. \nRed flags go up around him. \nI spoke with his son Tagg at the New Hampshire
    debates back in June (2007), and while he seemed like a nice man, Tagg could not
    get his facts right either. \nThe worst Republican as of late, though, is Larry
    Craig. \nHe is a lying pervert who wanted gay sex with a strange man on a dirty
    toilet seat. \nHe pled guilty, then said he was not guilty. \nSay what? \nHe is
    another Republican moron. \nDid you hear about Washington State Republican Rep.
    Richard Curtis? \nHe offered $1,000 to a young man for unprotected sex while dressed
    in women's lingerie.  \nThis sort of thing just goes on and on with them. \nRemember
    Mark Foley? \nHere is a letter I wrote that was in many newspapers and Web sites:
    \n \nOnce again, the Republicans have turned my stomach with shocking and repulsive
    behavior. \nMark Foley, a Republican member (now ex-member) of Congress, has sent
    many e-mails with perverted sexual content to a sixteen year old boy. \nThis is
    the same man who while in Congress, backed a bill that was meant to protect children
    from child predators. \nFoley himself, is a man who preyed on a child with lust.
    \nWhat is also incomprehensible, is the fact that some Republicans knew of Foley&rsquo;s
    behavior, and yet, did not take a hard stand against this until it became public
    news. If I had a teenage son and/or daughter, I would not want them to go near
    any Republican leader for fear of either or both becoming a victim of a sick Republican
    pervert. \n \nThere were more than three hundred such letters in newspapers in
    2007 alone. \nMany of them in New Hampshire. \nThere are thousands on the Internet.
    \nNo lie. \nTHOUSANDS! \nThis does not even include articles, ads, radio, TV and
    other areas where the public takes notice.  \nIn fact, one Republican in California
    wanted me stopped once, because I was hurting some Republicans in their elections.
    \nI just want to do my part in helping to get rid of every Republican scumbag.
    \ \nFrom phone scams to the Union Leader (NH) covering up for Republicans, the
    garbage never ends. \nBut the Republican Party will end. \nDid you know that George
    W. Bush once made fun of the issue of Weapons of Mass Destruction? \nHe did, and
    in front of some shocked people during a black-tie event in 2004.  \nHe said....
    (While looking under a piece of furniture) \"Those weapons of mass destruction
    have got to be here somewhere.\"  \nThen, while pretending to look out of a window,
    Bush laughed as he said..... \"Nope, no weapons over there.\" \nWhile he was laughing,
    there were men and women fighting and dying in Iraq because of WMD. \nGeorge W.
    Bush should be removed from office because of that alone. \nFace it, Bill Clinton
    lied about having sex, and was impeached because of it. \nGeorge W. Bush however,
    did far worse, as he laughed at the very people who are fighting for the United
    States of America! \nThat about sums it all up! \n(By the way, this Bush/WMD was
    part of an article and letter I wrote as well.) \nThis leads us to John McCain.
    \nAll he seems to do is attack other candidates. \nHis Woodstock ad against Hillary
    Clinton was boring and without the facts. \nHe tells of Hillary wanting to spend
    a million dollars on a museum while he (McCain) supports spending more on the
    war in Iraq. \nHe wants you to believe that the Democrats are the big spenders,
    while it is McCain's Republican Party that has spent all the money Bill Clinton
    left us to a point where Bush had to borrow money from China. \nThink about that
    again. \nWe owe to China. \nThat is the Republican way. \nAlso, it must be noted
    that McCain even laughed at war. \nRemember when McCain changed the words of a
    Beach Boys song to Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Iran? \nMcCain even laughed when
    he was done. \nHe thought starting a war with Iran was a laughing matter. \nThat
    is the real John McCain. \nHe just can't be trusted. \nHe is another George Bush,
    and you know what we got with him.   \nThe Republican Party is a mess, and getting
    worse. \nPeople do not trust any of them, and we are all tired of their act. \nIf
    you are a NH Republican voter and plan on voting Tuesday (1/8), please do your
    country and New Hampshire a favor and either stay home or join another party.
    \nYour party is over! \n \nGeorge Vreeland Hill"

  content: "Are you a terrorist, Mr. Hill?  George Bush prevented a terrorist attack
    in America when EVERY international expert on terrorism swore, in the aftermath
    of 9/11, that a much bigger was coming within a year.  \n\nAlmost seven years
    later, that attack has not come.  Perhaps you, Mr. Hill, are disappointed by that
    fact.  Are you?  Do you wish some rag-head would kill 60,000 people at a football
    game?  A millions people with nuke?  You do, don't you? \n\nBTW, there were plenty
    of WMDs in Iraq.  It's just that people like you, blind in your hatred for America,
    for Bush, for people who served their country like me, failed to see them.  Your
    media ignored them.  Your ilk cheered Saddam and UBL and spat on American heroes.
    \ You cheered every time another IED killed or crippled an American serviceman
    or woman. \n\nThanks for wasting your time on my blog."

<p>Former governor Mitt Romney has won the Wyoming Caucuses.  Romney has 6 of the 12 delegates up for grabs.  Two other delegates are split between Thompson and Duncan Hunter.  With 4 delegates to be decided, that leaves Romney with a lock.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if Thompson could pick up 3 of the remaining 4, it would be a banner day for the true conservative voice.</p>

<p>The Wyoming GOP has an <a href="http://www.wygop.org/images/wy/nine%20da%202008%20form.xls" target="_blank">Excel spreadsheet </a>showing the candidate favored in each county.  You'll have to ignore counties with Alternates, as only the Delegates count.  (I figured this out because I know Wyoming has 12 delegates, but there are 24 counties listed--half the counties are alternates.)</p>
