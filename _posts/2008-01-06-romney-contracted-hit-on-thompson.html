<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/RobertDNovak/2008/01/05/mitts_divided_strategy?page=2">Robert Novak </a>(h/t <a target="_blank" href="http://politics.wizbangblog.com/2008/01/06/romney-spreading-rumors.php">Wizbang</a>! Jim Addison) reveals today that Mitt Romney's campaign released <a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/03/the-thompson-hit/">the phony story </a>that Fred Thompson would withdraw and send his support to McCain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That may explain why it appeared Thompson and McCain <a target="_blank" href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080106/D8U0H56G0.html">singled out Romney </a>for attacks in Saturday Night's debate on ABC.</p>
<p>Addision is a bit skeptical of Novak's conclusions, noting that Bob did not name a source.&nbsp; I suspected Huckabee's campaign as the source, but Romney is also a possibility.&nbsp; Challenging Addison's logic, Thompson is THE conservative candidate.&nbsp; Getting him out of the race eliminates a distraction and avoids <a target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=3105288&amp;page=1">McCain-Thompson teamwork </a>like we saw last night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Huckabee's support would likely move to Thompson.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080106/D8U0H5S00.html">Evangelicals </a>are not only social conservatives, but economic conservatives, too.&nbsp; Right now, they appear blinded by their religious identity with Huckabee to look at the complete package.&nbsp; That blindness also prevents them from seeing that Thompson and McCain share Huckabee's religious views, if to different degrees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; One of the campaigns invented a story to hurt Thompson, and the drive-bys did the underhanded bidding.&nbsp; And Thompson boldly called them on it today (<a target="_blank" href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/mark-finkelstein/2008/01/06/fred-after-false-withdrawal-rumor-i-owe-media-nothing">Newsbusters</a>).</p>
