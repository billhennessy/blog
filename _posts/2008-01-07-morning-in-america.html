<p>Many of you don't remember 1984.  I was a junior in college, campaigning for Reagan, on campus and off.  For those of you who weren't around then, I can tell that even gray, rainy days were brighter than than sunniest June sky had been in 1979.</p>
<p>Nothing expresses the change in America better than this classic.  Brought to you by the Republicans.</p>
