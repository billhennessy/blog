  content: There appears to be a liberal media effort to downplay Thompsons performance
    throughout all of the debates.  Thompson is profound, professional and presidential.  Let's
    start making more noise on his behalf.

<p>I could not watch the South Carolin GOP debate tonight, but I am ecstatic.  Ron Paul  made an ass of himself, but <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/10/fred-thompson-late/">Michelle Malkin</a> who, like me, seems to fret over Fred's performances sometimes, has no doubt <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/10/the-south-carolina-gop-debate/" target="_blank">Fred won.</a></p>
<p>From the clip I blogged below, I have to give points to Romney for slamming Ron Paul.   As a war hero, John McCain had every right to across the stage and belt that phony, lying, racist scum.  But I'm glad he didn't--that would have sealed McCain's nomination and election.</p>
<p>****UPDATE*****</p>
<p>WHOA!  I just watched the clips of the debate on <a href="http://fredfile.fred08.com/blog/2008/video-great-debate-moments/">Fred08.com</a>.  Whoa! and again, whoa!   Our man was on fire tonight, and he flew past his $540,000 goal.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Fred.</p>
