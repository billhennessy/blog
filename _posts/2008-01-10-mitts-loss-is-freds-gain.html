<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8U2J6781&amp;show_article=1&amp;catnum=0" target="_blank">Mitt Romney</a> is pulling his broadcast advertising from South Carolina and Florida (h/t <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/" target="_blank">Drudge</a>).</p>
<p>This could help Fred's <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/08/the-battle-of-fort-sumter/">Fort Sumter strategy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I might have been wrong about Huckabee's descent, as he seems to remain above 20 percent in key states.&nbsp; By conceding South Carolina, though, Romney may end up driving soft supporters to Thompson, and that might be his strategy.</p>
<p>With McCain, the media darling, rising, Romney could hope to bump up Thompson's numbers in the Palmetto State.&nbsp; If Fred wins SC and Romney wins Michigan, where he's concentrating his efforts, he'll slow McCain's Straight Talk Express.</p>
<p>The strategy could backfire if Thompson parlays a South Carolina victory into free media and big surge in the polls.&nbsp; At this point, though, having lost New Hampshire and Iowa, it might be Romney's best hope.</p>
<p>Robert Novak reported earlier today that Romney's campaign "<a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=24373" target="_blank">is at death's door</a>."</p>
