<p>More of<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/12/how-many-people-has-george-soros-killed/" target="_blank"> George Soros's buddies</a>, al Qaeda, attacked an American school in Gaza tonight (US time).&nbsp; <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/01/al-qaeda-raids-us-school.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> provides:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Armed men entered the school in Beit Lahiya during the night and ransacked rooms as well as adminstration offices, and stole several computers."</p></blockquote>
<p>Nasty fucks.&nbsp; I'll bet George Soros finances this act of terrorism, too.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The raid on the school was the second in a week.</strong> On Wednesday armed men fired anti-tank rockets at it, causing serious damage to the building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, the enemy is radical Islam--and their American puppets.</p>
