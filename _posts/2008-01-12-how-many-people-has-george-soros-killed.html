    I featured recently <a href="http://thecriticalthinker.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/george-soros/" rel="nofollow">Soros interviewed by Fareed Zakaria</a> where they discussed market bubbles due to misconceptions and how reality bursts the bubble and crashes it.

    Soros' call against forecasting and adopting a fallible attitude towards market fundamentalism is reminiscent of <a href="http://thecriticalthinker.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/rare-events/" rel="nofollow">Nassim Taleb's skepticism</a>.

    Although Soros blames leverage excesses for the crisis, unlike fellow critics <a href="http://thecriticalthinker.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/peter-schiffs-track-record-for-predictions/" rel="nofollow">Peter Schiff</a> and <a href="http://thecriticalthinker.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/peter-schiffs-track-record-for-predictions/" rel="nofollow">Jim Rogers</a>, Soros believes in government's role to regulate markets  being doubtful of the notion that "markets self-correct to equilbrium". Markets can get carried into long trends up and down due to public misconceptions.

  content: "Mark,\n\nThanks for commenting.  As you can imagine, I have little faith
    in Soros.  John Kenneth Galbraith said many things with which I almost agreed--such
    as that experts are often wrong.  That doesn't mean I'm a socialist. \n\nIn this
    case, Soros's error is fundamental.  Government, in this case, is not the solution
    to the problem; government IS the problem.  The debt and housing bubbles were
    driven, even ordered, by the government.  That they blame the people is either
    an indication of their ignorance or of their hubris. \n\nCordially,\nBill Hennessy"

<p>Anti-American billionaire <a href="http://mrssatan.blogspot.com/2008/01/george-soros-funds-phony-lancet-study.html" target="_blank">George Soros</a> would kill his own mother to make us believe he's right. Then he'd pay millions to cover up his crime.</p>
<p>What other conclusion can we draw after learning, to no surprise, the Soros funded the fictitious Lancet report of 650,000 Iraqi deaths--a report <a href="http://www.floppingaces.net/2008/01/04/another-debunking-of-the-lance/" target="_blank">since dismissed</a> by everyone from the DNC to the United Nations.</p>
<p>From London's <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3177653.ece" target="_blank">TimesOnline</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A STUDY that claimed 650,000 people were killed as a result of the invasion of Iraq was partly funded by the antiwar billionaire George Soros.</p>
<p>Soros, 77, provided almost half the &pound;50,000 cost of the research, which appeared in The Lancet, the medical journal. Its claim was 10 times higher than consensus estimates of the number of war dead.</p>
<p>New research published by The New England Journal of Medicine estimates that 151,000 people - less than a quarter of The Lancet estimate - have died since the invasion in 2003.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authors should have disclosed the [Soros] donation and for many people that would have been a disqualifying factor in terms of publishing the research,&rdquo; said Michael Spagat, economics professor at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p></blockquote>
<p><!--#include file="m63-article-related-attachements.html"-->This is more evidence of why no rational person would believe anything a liberal says.&nbsp; They're all liars, and George Soros is right at the top of list.&nbsp; These people form prejudices then invent "facts" to support them.&nbsp; They are opposite of learned, of intellectual, of curious.&nbsp; They are brain-dead in the truest meaning of the word, in that they avoid challenges to their twisted, selfish world views.</p>
<p>The hoopla from leftist shitbags and the American media dispirited our troops and shattered the resolved of our allies.&nbsp; These consequences produced other consequences, including loss of American and Iraqi lives.&nbsp; George Soros, of course, cheers such misery because, in his fucked up mind, death in Iraq makes him look good.&nbsp; What a sick sack of shit he is.</p>
<p>It's time for Soros to find Dr. Kevorkian and end his destructive existence. &nbsp; It'll be a bright day when he's escorted, with special fanfare and pomp, through the cavernous gates of Hell.</p>
<p>Here's a great blog on the issues form <a href="http://jayreding.com/archives/2008/01/04/the-lancet-study-a-case-of-fraud/" target="_blank">Jay Reding</a>&nbsp; and more commentary from <a href="http://patterico.com/2008/01/06/questions-about-lancet-study/" target="_blank">Patterico</a> and <a href="http://republicanoperative.com/blog/soros-iraq-death-study-was-a-sham.htm" target="_blank">The Operative Blog</a>. A very thoughtful and readable piece in <a href="http://southdakotapolitics.blogs.com/south_dakota_politics/2008/week2/index.html#entry-43946394" target="_blank">South Dakota Politics.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>CNN and CBS are notoriously shameless.&nbsp; &nbsp;But Lancet, and the John Hopkins School of Public Health, enjoy the sort of reputations that are acquired only with decades of scrupulous care.&nbsp; Yet they put all that aside to push a politically jaundiced pseudo-study just before an American election.&nbsp; That is political corruption, and it is worth knowing about.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed.&nbsp; George Soros--liberalism--corrupts all.</p>
