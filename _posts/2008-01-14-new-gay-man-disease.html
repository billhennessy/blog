<p>A staph infection strain that killed 19,000 Americans in 2005 and was formerly contained to hospital is now spreading among gay men in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York.  (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1337175820080114?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true" target="_blank">Reuters </a>via <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/" target="_blank">Drudge</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Sexually active gay men in San Francisco are 13 times more likely to be infected than their heterosexual neighbors, the researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine.</p>
<p><span id="midArticle_3"></span>"Once this reaches the general population, it will be truly unstoppable," said Binh Diep, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco who led the study. "That's why we're trying to spread the message of prevention."</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Of those people who carry staph, most carry it in their noses but community-based MRSA also can live in and around the anus and is passed between sexual partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>And you thought the housing slump was a pain in the butt.</p>
<blockquote><p>The best way to avoid infection is by washing the hands or genitals with soap and water, Diep said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really.  My cro-magnon little mind was thinking, "stop using your anus as a sex organ."  Silly me.</p>
<p>But it gets better.  As you know, among the conspiracy whacks, Reagan invented AIDS and the CIA planted it in gay communities.  Well, it took a thread on the Democratic Underground only about 13 posts to (a) cheer that non-gay men have died from the disease, and (b)<a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=102x3139311#3139728" target="_blank"> blame it on the CIA</a>.</p>
