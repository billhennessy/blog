<p>The polls in South Carolina closed 52 minutes ago, and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/politics/elections/state?state=SC">ABC News</a> projects that John McCain and Mike Huckebee will finish first and second (or second and first) with Fred Thompson battling Mitt Romney for third.</p>
<p>A third place finish could spell the end for Thompson and hopes for a conservative Republican candidate in 2008. A win for McCain could put the Arizona Senator and former POW on a wave that would carry him to the nomination--and a brutal defeat in November.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.punditguy.com/2008/01/the_end_of_fred.html">PunditGuy</a>, too, wonders if this is the end for Fred.</p>
<p>Republican moderates don't beat Democrat liberals for the same reason people who want dangerous dogs don't buy Poodles. Yes, you can abuse a Poodle until it's vicious, but it's a lot easier just to buy a Pit Bull.</p>
<p>I am taking Mrs. Hennessy out to dinner, now. I hope there's better news from the Palmetto State when I get back.<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/">Michelle Malkin</a> is posting regular updates, and there's always news on <a href="http://www.fred08.com/">Fred08.com</a>.</p>
