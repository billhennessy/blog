<p>Last weekend, news of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/12/al-qaeda-in-cananda-attacked-by-publisher/">Canada's "Human Rights" Commission's</a> persecution of a magazine publish sent a frightening chill through her freedom-loving neighbors to the south (US) and through many of her own good citizens.</p>
<p>This week, we learn that some <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/12162007/postopinion/editorials/canadas_thought_police_72483.htm" target="_blank">Canadians continue their persecution</a> of conservatives, Christians, and free-speakers.</p>
<p>Right Wing News has the story of  a blogger called before an Islamic council to answer for his crimes--printing excerpts of a <a href="http://www.freemarksteyn.com/" target="_blank">Mark Steyn</a> <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/12162007/postopinion/editorials/canadas_thought_police_72483.htm" target="_blank">book</a>.  It seems that Canada has outlawed speech--written or oral--that any Muslim finds uncomfortable.  Sort of like the Nazis, isn't it?  Or Kabul under the Taliban?</p>
<p>At the risk of pissing off an entire country, not to mention the one that produces some of my favorite hockey players, perhaps we should stop pretending Canada to be a democracy.  It's much closer to an Islamic Republic.</p>
