<p>I love many things about WordPress, but their upgrades suck.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago, WP notified users that an urgent security fix was required.&nbsp; I put it off as long as I could, but last night seemed like a good time to try it.</p>
<p>I have 2--count 'em 2--test sites. I upgraded both of them with no problem.&nbsp; then I repeated the process exactly on my live site and permalinks broke.&nbsp; Anyone trying to link to one of my posts received a hideous 404 error.</p>
<p>Then, categories were destroyed.</p>
<p>Had I gone from version 1.0 to 2.3.2, I could expect issues.&nbsp; But I went from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2!</p>
<p>As i said, the WP folks do a lot of great things for free.&nbsp; But smooth upgrades ain't one of them.</p>
