<p>Sorry, folks.&nbsp; I'm paying attention to the world in between client meetings.&nbsp; I have my most significant client in town.</p>
<p>I am heartbroken that Fred Thompson ended his race. &nbsp; I am discouraged that he <em>had</em> to end it. The only Reagan conservative--well, Reagan-style conservative--in the race is gone.&nbsp; My best to Fred and his family.</p>
<p>That leaves us with McCain (moderate) and Romney (smarmy).</p>
<p>And Obama (Jimmy Carter).</p>
<p>I'll blog more tomorrow, but Carter's presidency gave us Reagan.</p>
