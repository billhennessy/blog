<p>We all know the trouble when a people, however recently formed, lose their homeland. Even if given privileged guest status in another country, they tend to make trouble for everyone around.&nbsp; (Think Palestinians.)</p>
<p>The Taliban continue to wage war against freedom in Afghanistan.&nbsp; Likewise, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/02/01/talk-back-to-berkeley-sign-the-petition/" target="_blank">the vile people of Berkeley, California</a>, wish to be free of the burdens of freedom.&nbsp; I have the solution:</p>
<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/02/berkeley-protesters-chain-themselves-to.html" target="_blank">Cede Berkeley, California, to the Taliban</a>.</p>
<p>Radical Islamists would love the location and the accomodating people.&nbsp; Berkeley women would enjoy the new fashion mandates.&nbsp; The Marines would close their despised recruiting station and, instead, set up a perimeter to keep the Taliban--and all other Berkeleyites--from leaving the area.</p>
<p>And talk about tree-hugging!&nbsp; The city that banned barbecues ages ago would return to the time of Christ.&nbsp; No more BMWs and Toyota hybrids.&nbsp; Greenhouse gasses would come only from Berkeleyites' measurable hind ends and those of their sheep and goats.&nbsp; Chicken would range free, as most of the people wouldn't afford cages.</p>
<p>Best of all, with the Taliban hierarchy in California, monitoring their activity would be much easier.&nbsp; The NSA could track its every move, along with the activities of Berkeley's resident seditionists.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling, please <a href="http://www.moveamericaforward.com/" target="_blank">sign this petition</a>, and e-mail these<a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/02/is-there-a-way.html" target="_blank"> anti-American left-wing idiots</a> until their inboxes explode:</p>

<p>If all else fails, perhaps the Marines should retreat and call in an air strike on the city.&nbsp; I could pull that trigger myself and never lose a moment's sleep.</p>
