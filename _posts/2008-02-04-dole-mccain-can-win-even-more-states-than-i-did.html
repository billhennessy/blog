<p>Former Sentator and Republican nominee for President, <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080204/D8UJPM380.html" target="_blank">Bob Dole</a>, came to John McCain's defense, today.&nbsp; Taking umbrage at anti-McCain rhetoric from conservatives like Rush Limbaugh, Dole struck back, declaring McCain a superior candidate.&nbsp; Here is the text of Dole's message:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Bob Dole ran for president, Bob Dole lost to an unpopular, scandal-ridden Democrat who had just lost both houses of Congress in an off-year Republican landslide.</p>
<p>Listen to Bob Dole: &nbsp; Bob Dole was an establishment Republican.&nbsp; He was a war hero.&nbsp; He was a populist.&nbsp; Bob Dole strong-armed Ronald Reagan into signing a tax increase only a year after Reagan pioneered a tax cut that save America's economy.</p>
<p>Bob Dole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1996" target="_blank">carried nineteen states</a>--that's almost half of them.&nbsp; Bob Dole ran on Democrat Party principles against a sitting Democrat president.&nbsp; Bob Dole received nearly 41 percent of the of popular vote!</p>
<p>And Bob Dole is here to tell you that John McCain can do even better.</p>
<p>John McCain sponsored the greatest restriction in free speech since Vladimir Lenin created the re-education camps.&nbsp; John McCain supports amnesty for illegals.&nbsp; John McCain opposes all tax cuts and spending restraints.&nbsp; John McCain is friends with Ted Kennedy.</p>
<p>America has too many choices.&nbsp; The last thing we need is to choose between a real conservative and left-wing nut job from the Democrat party.&nbsp; Bob Dole says the GOP should offer the American people a part-time conservative, liberal Republican, an establishment Republican in the mold of Nelson Rockefeller, John Dewey, and Gerald R. Ford.</p>
<p>Bob Dole says 'Vote for McCain.'&nbsp; Then we can sling mud at a Democrat president for the next four years, the way we like it.</p></blockquote>
