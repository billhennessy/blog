<p>Not entirely my fault.</p>
<p>I planned to vote on my way home from work.  I have a client-facing job, and I have to respond to production issues.  Tonight's issue lasted until 6:10.  Then, either local flooding or a bad accident had a major road to my house closed.  It took over 45 minutes to get through the detour.   By that time, it was 7:00 p.m., and my polling place in Ellisville, Missouri, was closed.</p>
<p>I apologize to everyone.</p>
<p>I would have voted for Romney.</p>
