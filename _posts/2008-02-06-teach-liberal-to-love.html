<p>I just sent a copy of "<a>Hard Corps: From Gangster to Marine Hero</a>" to Berkeley, California, Mayor Tom Bates.  After all the anger directed at Berkeley after its city council voted to declare our great Marines <em>persona non grata</em>, I figured, "Maybe these people are just ignorant."</p>
<p>So I'm teaching the mayor to read, and what.  If you'd like to educate other members of the council, find their names and addresses <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/02/03/give-berkeley-to-taliban/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/02/us-marines-winn.html">Black Five reports </a>that two Berkeley council members have introduced a bill to rescind the letter to the Marines that started the fight.  Good for them.  Your pressure worked!</p>
