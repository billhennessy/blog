<p>The New York Times on Tuesday will carry story describing the Hillary Clinton campaign as a death-watch (h/t <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Drudge</a>).</p>
<p>It's worth noting that on January 7, I wrote the Kerry campaign obituary prematurely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the problems Hillary faces are of the sort that spells doom to candidates, either in their nomination quest or, later, in the general election.&nbsp; Shuffling top staff, borrowing money from the candidate, asking staff to work without pay are all symptoms of a campaign in deep trouble.&nbsp; Ed Muskie went through such turmoil in the 1972, losing to the dark-horse George McGovern.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ford won the GOP nomination over Ronald Reagan in 1976, but his campaign was in tatters by the convention and he hobbled to a defeat in November.&nbsp; More recently, Mitt Romney faced money issues that led him to pull advertising in the South; he was out a week later.</p>
<p>The telling sentance in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/12/us/politics/12clinton.html?ei=5065&amp;en=83bd560436fa713f&amp;ex=1203397200&amp;partner=MYWAY&amp;pagewanted=print">NYT </a>piece comes from a Super Delegate who's pledged for Hillary:</p>
<blockquote><p>"She has to win both Ohio and Texas comfortably, or she's out," said one superdelegate who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment. "The campaign is starting to come to terms with that."</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't count on a Texas landslide.</p>
<p>If Hillary folds after the March 4 round of primaries, the dynamics of the race will change dramatically. Without a brokered convention to draw viewers to the convention, Obama will miss some valuable free advertising.&nbsp; But Obama has an easy road ahead.&nbsp; He'll be running against a Republican candidate that many Republicans, particularly the base, don't like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My prediction?&nbsp; We'll get to find out what <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/01/07/change-is-all-you-need/">a second Carter term </a>would have been like.</p>
