<p>Last week, Rowan Williams, the idiot who presides over the Anglican church, made comments on the radio that his country should adopt Islamic law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/11/AR2008021102783.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&amp;sub=AR">Washington Post </a>reports that Williams sticks by his sentiments in favor of the abolition of freedom and Christianity, but like so many spineless weasels in today's public eye, Williams says he'd made a "misleading choice of words."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man stupid enough to emit such utterances could not possibly benefit from my attacks: his stupidity is beyond human reach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He might, however, solve many problems by returning to the Mother Church and leaving behind childish things like Anglicanism and Islam.</p>
<p>Worse for us, a President Obama would give Williams cheer by adopting the Sharia law in our country.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/02/09/resign-archbishop-of-dhimmitude/">Michelle Malkin</a> has much more, including Williams's past verbal atrocities.</p>
