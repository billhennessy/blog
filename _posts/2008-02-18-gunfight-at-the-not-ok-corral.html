<p>Clinton Inc. will do whatever (it thinks) it takes to secure the Democrat nomination for president.</p>
<p>The news of the past two days has been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/02/18/ST2008021802264.html">Obama's plagiarism</a>.&nbsp; As if Obama is can't produce his own pandering drivel.&nbsp;&nbsp; From WaPo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, key Clinton supporters accused Obama of "lifting" a passage of the rousing speech he delivered to a party gathering in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Milwaukee?tid=informline">Milwaukee</a> on Saturday night from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Deval+Patrick?tid=informline">Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick</a>, a longtime friend and supporter.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/017019.php">Captain Ed</a> notes that the Clintons are making much over nothing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Put simply, it's nonsense. It is, however, an indication of how desperate Hillary has become to derail Obama.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's more than desperation; it's personal.&nbsp; Clinton Inc. can't stand the thought of losing. A loss in the primaries would be the end of that tragic legacy, a repudiation of the most corrupt administration since Johnson.&nbsp; And the Little Rock mafia won't stand for such.</p>
<p>Hillary is counting heavily on the Super Delegates, many of whom, no doubt, will vote for Clinton at the convention to avoid embarrassing disclosures.&nbsp; (The Clintons have everyone's FBI record, remember?)</p>
<p>This should add up to quite an entertaining convention.&nbsp; And that could be bad news for McCain.</p>
