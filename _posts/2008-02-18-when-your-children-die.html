<p>When your children die at the hands of terrorists, blame the Democrats and their lawyer friends.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and other Democrats let the domestic surveillance law die.&#160; They did it because their Trial Lawyer donors want to sue telecommunication companies who help stop terrorism.&#160; </p>
<p>It's impossible to count the number of American lives saved by electronic surveillance.&#160; We know it's in the thousands.&#160; Possibly the hundreds of thousands.&#160; </p>
<p>When the law authorizing this critical counter-terrorism law came up for renewal, Trial Lawyers, who stand to make billions suing telephone companies, spend millions lobbying liberal Senators, and the lobbying worked.&#160; Hillary didn't show up for the vote, and Obama voted against re-authorization.&#160; Both candidates' campaigns have accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from specific law firms who want to sue telephone companies.&#160; </p>
<p>Some will argue that the eavesdropping law infringed on civil rights.&#160; Well, the courts already decided against that.&#160; Congress's failure to act had nothing to do with political science or philosophy; it had to do with money.&#160; </p>
<p>When the next terrorist attack occurs--an attack that this law might have prevented--I hope those who let the law die meet with an angry mob, chains, and pitchforks.&#160; </p>
