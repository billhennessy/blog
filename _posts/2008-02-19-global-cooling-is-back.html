<p>Baby, it's cold outside.&#160; Are you cold tonight?</p>
<p>I thought it was just me.&#160; Here in St. Louis, we've had a few way above average temp days this winter, including 70+ in January and February.&#160; But between those balmy days are many, many below average days and nights.&#160; My gas bill has been in over $200 a month, and I live in an 11-year-old, well insulated home.</p>
<p>Now, we learn that the polar ice caps have reversed five years of shrinkage by returning rapidly old levels.&#160; From the <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/35266/Global-warming-It-s-the-coldest-winter-in-decades" target="_blank">Daily Express</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was feared that the polar caps were vanishing because of the effects of global warming.</p>
<p>But figures from the respected US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that almost all the &#8220;lost&#8221; ice has come back.</p>
<p>Ice levels which had shrunk from 13million sq km in January 2007 to just four million in October, are almost back to their original levels.</p>
<p>Figures show that there is nearly a third more ice in Antarctica than is usual for the time of year.</p>

<p><font color="#555555">Now, the idiots will tell us that record cold temperatures and increasing ice caps prove global warming is real.&#160; Just remember--they're idiots.
