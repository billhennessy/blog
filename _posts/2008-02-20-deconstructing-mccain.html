<p>The right (myself included) knew damn well what the left media were up to:&#160; influence voters to pick the weakest, viable Republican candidate.</p>
<p><a href="http://discerningtexan.blogspot.com/2008/02/generating-still-more-support-from.html" target="_blank">They've done it</a>.</p>
<p>McCain was the "media darling" candidate only until all other candidates fell out.&#160; That fall out came with this week's primaries.&#160; Today, the very media that built up McCain and propelled him to the Republican nomination tore him down.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/politics/21mccain.html?ei=5065&amp;en=30275248afff65bf&amp;ex=1204174800&amp;partner=MYWAY&amp;pagewanted=print" target="_blank">Thursday's New York Times</a> destroys the Arizona Senator in a premeditated plan to secure the White House for the DNC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. McCain, 71, and the lobbyist, Vicki Iseman, 40, both say they never had a romantic relationship. But to his advisers, even the appearance of a close bond with a lobbyist whose clients often had business before the Senate committee Mr. McCain led threatened the story of redemption and rectitude that defined his political identity.</p>
<p>It had been just a decade since an official favor for a friend with regulatory problems had nearly ended Mr. McCain&#8217;s political career by ensnaring him in the Keating Five scandal. In the years that followed, he reinvented himself as the scourge of special interests, a crusader for stricter ethics and campaign finance rules, a man of honor chastened by a brush with shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take that, Mr. Golden Boy of the MSM!&#160; </font></p>
<p>In McCain's defense (something I'm not used to taking), the NYT story is salacious pack of innuendo.&#160; But it demonstrates what smart conservatives like Rush Limbaugh have been saying for years:&#160; the mainstream media are activists, not reporters.&#160; </p>
<p>The paper that praised McCain, now destroys him.&#160; In the most cold-blooded indictment of motivations I've ever read, the paper lays out this quest for power:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. McCain started his career like many other aspiring politicians, eagerly courting the wealthy and powerful. A Vietnam war hero and Senate liaison for the Navy, he arrived in Arizona in 1980 after his second marriage, to Cindy Hensley, the heiress to a beer fortune there. He quickly started looking for a Congressional district where he could run.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating, a Phoenix financier and real estate developer, became an early sponsor and, soon, a friend. He was a man of great confidence and daring, Mr. McCain recalled in his memoir. &#8220;People like that appeal to me,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I have sometimes forgotten that wisdom and a strong sense of public responsibility are much more admirable qualities.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a year, now, I have been warning you that a moderate Republican is a dead Republican.&#160; We nominated a moderate, and he's dead.&#160; Nonstarter.&#160; Still-born. </font></p>
<p>Congratulations, GOP.&#160; You get to play the minority party for four more years.&#160; </font></p>
