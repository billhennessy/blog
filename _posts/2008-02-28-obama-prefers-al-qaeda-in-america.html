<p>Demonstrating a remarkable daftness for thinking on his feet, Barack Obama magnified the folly of a debate gaffe, today, in a clumsy rejoinder to John McCain's response.</p>
<p>In a debate, Obama said he would deploy troops back into Iraq, after a pullout, if al Qaeda established bases.&#160; (Do I really need to point out the lack of intelligence, understanding, and strategy his comment portrays?)</p>
<p>McCain responded by saying, "I have news for Senator Obama, al Qaeda is in Iraq, and that's why we're fighting in Iraq."</p>
<p>Obama's response [<a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/" target="_blank">via CNN</a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>But I have some news for John McCain, and that is that there was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, Senator, before we invaded Iraq, al Qaeda was in Manhattan killing your Democrat opponent's constituents.&#160; </p>
<p>Such details escape the junior Senator from Illinois, though.&#160; Messiahs don't sweat the small stuff. </p>
<p>The best shot in this debate came from W himself:&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>I believe Senator Obama better stay focused on his campaign with Senator Clinton, neither of whom has secured their party's nomination yet.</p>
</blockquote>
