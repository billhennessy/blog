<p>Disks ping-pong across the floor   <br />while Polar Bears dance on steel stilts    <br />and the teacher in a JFK suit    <br />tells his failing pupils all is well.&#160; All is well.</p>
<p>All isn't well in the theatre, though.   <br />All is tight, worried and sad.&#160; Foreboding.    <br />The clock's ticks annoy the voyeurs    <br />who stand in nervous circles, smoking.</p>
<p>The patient may not have the year.   <br />The doctors may not have the room.    <br />The semester may be out of quarters    <br />before the class learns to add and subtract.</p>
