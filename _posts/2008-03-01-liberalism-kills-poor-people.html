<p>The owner of a St. Louis-area pizza parlor chain, <a href="http://www.fortelspizzaden.com/" target="_blank">Fortel's</a>, recently told <a href="http://www.kmox.com" target="_blank">KMOX</a> radio that the price of 50-lbs. sacks of flour she uses in her pizzas has risen from $11 to more than $30 in recent months.&#160; Her suppliers told her to expect the price to exceed $50 soon.</p>
<p>Both the US and the UN have announced plans to reduce food distribution programs to the world's poorest people.&#160; Both site hyper-inflation in food prices, mostly grains, dairy, and meat, as we see in this piece on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022904029.html?wpisrc=newsletter" target="_blank">WashingtonPost.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The prices have risen as more of the grains are being consumed by biofuel production and fast-growing markets in China and India, The Washington Post reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor people must die for Western liberals to feel good about themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.N. program is confronting similar price pressures. It announced this month that it was facing a $505 million shortfall due to soaring food and fuel costs, and would cut distribution if it did not receive new funds. Meanwhile, need is increasing.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Afghanistan?tid=informline">Afghanistan</a>, for instance, recently put in an emergency request for $77 million to cope with skyrocketing prices that have put key staples out of reach for more and more Afghans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think "hyper-inflation" hyperbolic, think again:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Look at what's happened to wheat prices alone -- they shot up 25 percent in one day last week," said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program. "This is really the first emergency we've faced without a drought, war, natural disaster. We will have to cut the amount of people being served or the amount of food being served if we do not get more funds."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The planet is dying, you know.&#160; Despite the fact that <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/02/29/interesting-plots-of-temperature-trends-the-4-global-temperature-metrics-according-to-basil/" target="_blank">the world has been cooling</a> since about 1998, liberals, including that lovely couple that just moved in down the street, are convinced that human activity is causing temperatures to rise.&#160; (Of course, they can't explain why temperatures rose to similar levels in Medieval times.)&#160; They just know, as an article of faith, that people like me and you are killing the planet.</p>
<p>So the push for bio-fuels, which emit more greenhouse gases than a 1972 Chevelle.&#160; </p>
<p>We know from economics 101 that increased demand will raise the equilibrium price of a good or service.&#160; And higher prices result in increased supply, as the profit potential influences more sellers to enter the market.&#160; (Thus, high gasoline prices resulted in high diesel fuel prices as refiners shifted production from diesel to unleaded.)&#160; </p>
<p>In this case, wheat and other kinds of farmers are shifting to corn production because the price of corn is so high.&#160; (Corn is the principal ingredient in most bio-fuel recipes.)&#160; Less wheat is produced relative to demand, the price rises to equilibrium, and poor people starve.&#160; The cheapest food source on the planet, grain, leaves the mouths of starving kids in Africa to fuel Barbara Streisand's&#160; Tuesday afternoon lunch with Bette Midler.</p>
<p>Perhaps scientists will find a way to power automobiles with carcasses of African children.&#160; Then, alas, the poorest of the poor will be well-fed.&#160; </p>
