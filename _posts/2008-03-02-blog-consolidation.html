<p>Last night I read <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/017170.php">Ed Morrissey's farewell </a>from Captain's Quarters.&#160; He's headed to <a href="http://hotair.com/">HotAir.com </a>where he'll Michelle Malkin and others.&#160; Not that I'd missed the trend to move from solo blogging to group blogging, then to extremely commercial blogging, but Ed's voluntary consolidation saddened me.&#160; Not that it should. </p>
<p>Consolidation seems a natural tendency among human beings and their institutions.&#160; Remember the CLECs?&#160; (Competitive Local Exchange Carriers were the new phone companies like Allegiance, Onvoy, Big, McCloud.)&#160; They were independents who consolidated then sold to the Baby Bells.&#160; It was the end of competition in local phone service.</p>
<p>Remember Eastern Airlines?&#160; TWA?&#160; Ozark?&#160; America West?&#160; They're gone, too, along with the neighborhood coffee shop and corner grocery store.&#160; </p>
<p>In fact, assimilation seems as natural among our species as cell division.&#160; That makes me wonder whether evolution theories are just plain wrong.&#160; Evolution would seem to indicate that one species becomes two then twenty.&#160; The number of species would tend to increase.&#160; When we look at human behavior we might conclude that the opposite occurs.&#160; </p>
<p>For example, imagine wolves and another carnivorous species sharing a common hunting ground.&#160;&#160; The two coexist while they maintain some distinctions.&#160; Finally, the wolf adapts the behaviors of its competitor, and the competitor flocks to the wolf pack for protection and food.&#160; They merge.&#160; What's left is the wolf, only the wolf, but slightly changed from the wolves of the past. </p>
<p>In all of human endeavor, the natural process seems to be:&#160; individuals begin competitive enterprises, then merge into consolidated enterprises, then cease to be what they were. The only exceptions are TV sitcoms and rock bands. </p>
<p>But "Laverne and Shirley" was never "Happy Days," and "Petticoat Junction" was never "Green Acres."&#160; Though Paul McCartney and John Lennon were successful and prolific after the breakup, they were never Beatles alone.&#160; </p>
<p>Would Notre Dame football still be Notre Dame football&#160; if it joined the Big 10? </p>
<p>HotAir and Ed Morrissey both stand to benefit from the merger.&#160; Running one's own blog is a lot of work.&#160; Were that I needed only write.&#160; Ed can now concentrate on what he does so well--research and blog.&#160; He's from the management concerned that played on his mind until yesterday.</p>
<p>But blogging loses, at least one voice.&#160; </p>
<p>When I launched The Hennessy Report in 2000 on software I wrote, I did so because I liked the idea of the lone voice yelling reason into a chaotic and ignorant world.&#160; Previously, I'd learned the art of bookbinding in order to craft the first edition of my book.&#160; Benjamin Franklin, after all, was printer before he wrote the contents of his books and pamphlets.&#160; Craft before art.</p>
<p>I read today that more and more people get their news from the internet.&#160; They distrust the mainstream media.&#160; How many mergers, consolidations, and assimilations will it take before the internet becomes the mainstream media.&#160; Will it, then, be the voice of the individual?&#160; </p>
<p>The burdens of running my own site distract from my writing.&#160; But the internet is my craft.&#160; I don't really want partners or collaborators in this endeavor.&#160; I balance my job and its clients, my kids and their need for rides to school or practice, my wife and her need for attention and love.&#160; But blogging feels too individualistic a thing to leave the administration to others.</p>
<p>I wish Ed Morrissey and HotAir all the best.&#160; I do not criticize Ed in any way.&#160; Being true to myself, though, requires that I go it alone the way I started eight years ago.</p>
