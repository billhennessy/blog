    Take heart.  People are beginning to catch on to the scam.

    These articles show that the reaction against the Gore contingent is growing.  Keep up the fight!

<p>The Catholic Church is often wrongly accused of suppressing science throughout the so-called Dark Ages.&#160; Legend has it that the Church used her secular influence over divine-right monarchs to thwart scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>It's all hooey, of course. During the Medieval period, the lack of an economic system that generated surplus left the Church alone to advance science, translate texts, and preserve history. </p>
<p>But that's a different story.</p>
<p>Al Gore and his band of merry thought police are doing to science what the left claims the church did--slitting the throats of anyone who dares speak heresies against the Global Warming god.</p>
<p>The founder of Weather Channel, today, attacked his Frankensteinian monster for its intolerance and abandonment of science.&#160; From the <a href="http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2008/20080303175301.aspx" target="_blank">Business and Media Institute</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Weather Channel had great promise, and that&#8217;s all gone now because they&#8217;ve made every mistake in the book on what they&#8217;ve done and how they&#8217;ve done it and it&#8217;s very sad,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;It&#8217;s now for sale and there&#8217;s a new owner of The Weather Channel will be announced &#8211; several billion dollars having changed hands in the near future. Let&#8217;s hope the new owners can recapture the vision and stop reporting the traffic, telling us what to think and start giving us useful weather information.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Coleman" is John Coleman who founded the channel in 1982.&#160; His network now serves as the EWTN of the World Church of Human Hatred.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Weather Channel has been an outlet for global warming alarmism. In December 2006, The Weather Channel&#8217;s Heidi Cullen <a href="http://climate.weather.com/blog/9_11396.html">argued</a> on her blog that weathercasters who had doubts about human influence on global warming should be punished with decertification by the American Meteorological Society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Heidi Cullen is not a heroine addict who spoke in the throes of a junk-crave, then she is a fascist who destroy science, logic, and life itself to advance the cause of this bizarre new religion founded by L. Ron Algore.</p>
<p>I get my weather from Accuweather.com.&#160; It may as fascist as The Weather Channel, but I have no evidence as yet. </p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com" target="_blank">WattsUpWithThat.com</a> is the best climatology blog on the frigid planet.</p>
