<p>We are in for the worst economy since . . . the last time Democrats controlled Congress.</p>
<p>I compared three economic numbers from the January 1994, when Democrats lost control of Congress and January 2007, when they took Congress back.&nbsp; Then looked at what's happened since.&nbsp; It isn't pretty</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>January 1995</td>
<td>January 2007</td>
<td>January 2008</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unemployment</td>
<td>5.6</td>
<td>4.9</td>
<td>4.9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prime</td>
<td>8.5</td>
<td>6.98</td>
<td>7.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inflation</td>
<td>2.8</td>
<td>2.85</td>
<td>6.8</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>You can't blame anyone for these numbers except the Democrats.&nbsp; From the time he took office until the time Newt took the gavel, Clinton's economy was flat.&nbsp; Al Gore said, in 1993, that 2 percent GDP growth was all that Americans could expect.&nbsp; In that same year, Clinton said that the federal budget would remain unbalanced for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>Gore and Clinton were wrong, of course, because the American people did something about it: the elected Republicans.</p>
