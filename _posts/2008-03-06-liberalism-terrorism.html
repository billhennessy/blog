<p><img border="0" vspace="4" align="left" width="350" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/d8v88iu80.jpg" hspace="4" height="246" />Now that we're winning the war, the left is ratcheting up its anti-military hatemongering--all the way to terrorism.&nbsp; If the Congressmen who received the letters knew what was coming, they should taken out and shot, along the perp who did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, leftist terrorists bombed a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/03/06/ap/headlines/d8v88iu80.txt">U. S. Armed Forces recruitment center </a>in New York.&nbsp; This domestic terrorism should be met with lethal force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>California Senator Diane Fienstein, in an e-mail, reported that members of the House of Representatives received letters with a photo of the perp and a copy of his political manifesto.&nbsp; (Great reading, I'm sure.)</p>
<p>The left will blame Bush and the Republicans, since liberals are incapable of commiting crimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The left is downplaying the attack, as seen in the <a target="_blank" href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/police-investigate-explosion-in-times-square/index.html?hp">NYTimes' minimalist headline</a>.&nbsp; The NYT story attempts to link the bombing two other incidents involving foreign embassies.&nbsp; On the right, pundits seem subdued.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/03/06/small-explosion-at-times-square-recruiting-station/">Michelle Malkin </a>and even <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/03/explosion-at-mi.html">Black Five </a>took it in stride.&nbsp;I guess we're getting used to being abused and terrorized by liberals in America. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/03/tracking-iraq-what-media-did-not-tell.html">Gateway Pundit </a>is more worked up, as am I.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 10 letters that were mailed in advance of the bombing were addressed to Democrats.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; What did these 10 New York Democrats know, and when did they know it?&nbsp; Why did Diane Feinstein know abou the letters so early, maybe even before the police?</p>
<p><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/06/ny-bombing-why-letters-to-ny-congressional-contingent/">Ed Morrissey</a>, too, wonders why the letters went to Democrats who are on the bomber's side?&nbsp; He also notes them Michelle Malkin reports more Congressmen may have received the letters.</p>
