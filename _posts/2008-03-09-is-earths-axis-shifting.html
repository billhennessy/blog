    Interesting post.  Your conclusions are a bit off though.  Northern Europe was warmer because of the ADO and PDO, that is atlantic and pacific decadal oscillations  The shift of the poles as you suggest would take centuries not months.  It is indeed a great idea and one to keep an eye on, but 1.8 cm per year is not likely to make us so unstable as to shift the axis by much.

    Or are you going to argue that the overpopulated Northern Hemisphere is going to offset the earth's axis faster?  All those tall buildings will have more of an effect than a beetle due to the earth's inertia.  It is kind of like starting a spin with your arms in then spreading your arms out and slowing you down.  Will tall buildings slow the earth making it less stable on its axis?

    You also cannot forget about magnetic north.  The bulk of the earth, below the crust, is liquid and molton.  The magnetic north has been shifting.  The http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/nmp/northpole_e.php site has the north pole moving northwest.  "The most recent survey, completed in May, 2001, determined an updated position for the Pole and established that it is moving approximately northwest at 40 km per year."  The difference of 40km per year is not enough to make a huge difference to the climate.  The shift has been gradual.

    The http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4520982.stm link discusses magnetic north too.  "Previous studies have shown that the strength of the Earth's magnetic shield has decreased 10% over the past 150 years.  During the same period, the north magnetic pole wandered about 1,100km (685 miles) into the Arctic, according to the new analysis."  Now magnetic north is not the same as the earth' rotational axis.  Magnetic north is governed by the flow of the earth's core.  I simply wonder how much of this would affect the earth's axis.  I mean a dozen centimeters of snow is nothing compared to the momentum changes of the inner earth.

    growth of ice on the poles, or one pole, makes a Earth's shape a little closer
    to spherical?  According to Gold, the Earth's axis would become less stable. \n\nOr
    consider this from <a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/earth_wobble_010131.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Space.com</a>\n\n<blockquote>A new theory proposes that iron-rich
    sediments are floating to the top of the core and sticking to the bottom of the
    mantle, creating drag that throws Earth's rotation about its axis off by 0.04
    to 0.08 inch (a millimeter or two) over a period of about 18.6 years.\n\n\"The
    wobble is explained by metal patches attached to the core-mantle boundary,\" said
    Raymond Jeanloz, professor of geology and planetary science at the University
    of California, Berkeley. \"As the outer core turns, its magnetic field lines are
    deflected by the patches and the core fluid gets slowed down, just like mountains
    rubbing against the atmosphere slows the Earth down.\"</blockquote>\n\nAs I said,
    everyone knows that the Earth's axis wobbles.  Why couldn't that wobble affect
    climate, particularly localized climate?  \n\nReading the Space.com article further,
    we find that my speculation may not be as far-afield as you might assume.\n\n<blockquote>Other
    small deviations in Earth's rotation are known, also. They are called nutations.
    One is caused by Earth's annual circuit of the Sun, and another involves an 18.6-year
    precession of the Moon's orbit. While these nutations have been known for many
    years, precise measurements of the Earth's axis have turned up unexplained deviations
    from the predicted nutation.</blockquote>"

    these are repeatable, measurable patterns that have actually happened, they are

    I think the main thing you are missing is the randomness of the changes.  One beetle will sift the earth an infinitesimal amount in one direction.  When you consider all beetles over time, then their movements would cancel each other out.  While the accumulation of ice at the south pole is not random, it is also not that much extra inertia as compared to the mass of the earth.  Because it is off center, it will have some effect as Gold notes.  I do wonder about the use of the word stability.  We are talking about small changes.  Two millimeters every twenty years is more akin to the rate of tectonic shifts.  Glaciers move faster than this.

    When it comes to the earth's wobble, there is a variation as noted by Milankovitch.  He identified three cycles:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles

    His axial tilt (obliquity) cycle does indeed affect climate.  As the poles point more to the sun, there is less polar ice.  When the poles are more perpendicular to the path of sunlight, more ice can form at the poles.  This of course is outside the normal seasonal changes in tilt with respect to the sun.

    "In addition, the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit moves from 21.5 degrees to 24.5 degrees and back again on a 41,000-year cycle. Currently, this angle is 23.44 degrees and is decreasing."

    If this were the only cycle affecting climate, then we would be looking at global cooling.  My trouble is telling the difference between the 41,000 year axial tilt (obliquity) cycle and a much more gradual trend of which Gold is discussing.  Regardless, either change is so slow that it would not be noticeable to the masses over even a few hundred years.

    The most interesting thing I had read about this until your post is how the planet will continue to be in an ice age until Antarctica moves away from the south pole via plate tectonics.  Of course, Gold's theory suggests that the pole could move away from Antarctica instead.

  content: "Wobbly Earth and Climate Change\n\nI have known of Earth&rsquo;s wobbles
    for as long as I can remember, but it wasn&rsquo;t much of a thought until I noticed
    an oddity with the path that the Sun travels through the sky where I live. Last
    week 5~6 JUNE 2008 the Sun came up where it would have a few years ago upon the
    solstice.\n\nI pondered what effects an increasing instability in the wobble would
    have upon weather patterns and earthquakes.\n\nMy supposition is that there would
    be: \n\n- AN INCREASE IN SEVERE/STRANGE WEATHER&hellip; Not just floods and droughts,
    also quick shifts of weather patterns.\n \nSouthern California saw 100 degree
    days come even earlier this year (although this may not be evident from the official
    temperatures, which are consistently off by 5 to 10 degrees) just after a late
    cold spell. The shift had been more than sudden, it happened in one day. 13 May
    2008 the high temp where I live was 79 degrees. 14 May morning low was frosty
    36 degrees and then shot up to a high of 98 and the high temps continued for a
    week. The official records say 14 May temps were 44/88, but that is not what we
    observed. The official temps hid the fact that on the same day there was a record
    low and a record high (for that day).\n\nThen (catching all the weather forecasters
    by surprise) southern California was hit by a couple days of thunderstorms with
    hail and&hellip; tornados.\n\nI like maps, (my daughter likes my weather forecasts
    which are usually much more accurate than official forecasts) and had given a
    forecast on 20 May of a possible storm hitting in a couple days. The next day
    the news-weather was saying a &lsquo;cut-off&rsquo; low was making conditions
    for possible for scattered thunderstorms on 22~23 May.\n\nWhat I had noticed in
    the days prior, was the intensity of the jet stream muscling its way south along
    the west coast. The earth wobbling the west coast toward the north during the
    preceding week might be a stretch, but it does offer an explanation to the unusually
    quick southern dip of the jet stream that caused the surprise cut-off low pressure
    system. \n\n- AN INCREASE IN MAGNITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF EARTHQUAKES\n\nA quick
    look at the information on the usgs.gov website shows information to support this
    supposition.\n\n1900 thru 1949 there were forty-one (41) EQs of magnitude 8 or
    greater, an average of 0.82 per year.\nIn 2007 there were four (4) EQs of magnitude
    8 or greater.\n\n1900~1930 had fifty EQs of magnitude 7 or greater, an average
    of 1.67 per year.\n2007 had seventeen (17) EQs of magnitude 7 or greater\n2008
    has already had five (5) EQs of magnitude 7 or greater.\n\n\tScrolling through
    data it seems that worldwide EQs of magnitude 2.0 or greater occur at about 12
    to 20 per day. On 14 MAY there was about 75 EQs, 13 MAY had about 130 and 12 MAY
    had over 200.\n\nIs there a correlation? The 12 May 2008 earthquakes in China
    (and throughout the world) preceded the surprise tornados in Southern California,
    which were caused by the jet-stream making an unusually rapid and deep dive straight
    south down the west coast to Mexico.\n\nRight now the weather conditions are similar;
    however, I would be surprised by thunderstorms in a couple of days because the
    jet stream needs a little more help in accelerating its southern advance and there
    has not been a huge increase in seismic activity in the last ten days (okay, 10
    days ago was double the daily average, but far shy of 200).\n\n\tCan an increase
    in the Earth&rsquo;s wobble be related the elliptic passing through the galactic
    equator? Perhaps amongst all the Mayan end of world and planet X rabble something
    is being over-looked. By some accounts the elliptic passed through the galactic
    equator back in 1987 ~ 1989 which supposedly snubs the Mayan calendar and renders
    it a non-event because nothing happened, right?\n\nMaybe something did happen,
    and is still happening. It&rsquo;s fairly accepted that solar activities have
    increased in the past decade. Are we also seeing increased instabilities in the
    Earth&rsquo;s wobbles? Could this be a pre-cursor to the Earth flipping when 2/3
    of the elliptic has passed through the galactic equator by the end of 2012 and
    the Age of Aquarius begins?"

    I noticed, to our orientation, North, South, East
    West, the Earth Woobles South East to North West directly.

    I thought I noticed that the wooble was off this year. Earth shadow maybe three inches West, or the Earth shifted South East.

    Now I know its the Earths rotational axis.

    Opinion: I believe at the begining, four billion years ago
    our earth developed a momentum personality that dark matter presides. Our wobble is in good shape :)

    written by none other than Albert Einstein shortly before his death in 1955, Hapgood's
    arguments have been disproved, and plate tectonics is now universally accepted
    by mainstream science. In this book, and two successive books, Maps of the Ancient
    Sea Kings (1966) and The Path of the Pole (1970), Hapgood proposed the radical
    theory that the Earth's axis has shifted numerous times during geological history.
    This theory is not widely accepted by orthodox geologists.

    Mr. Cruz,

    No I would not scoff at any theory's, or model's presented as they are all open to debate? However, the environmental changes that are taking place are undoubtedly taking place are not a natural process. Leading research which is subject to peer review, lead to one theory: global warming is the cause of man, within the past century. I will given the time make further posting's, and furthermore, my own research and writing's on the subject, thank you.

  content: "cut and paste:  Geophysicist Discovers Why Earth 'Wobbles'\nScienceDaily
    (May 20, 2004) &mdash; The earth wobbles in space. This has been known for over
    a century by astronomers, and thanks to global positioning system (GPS) technologies,
    this wobble has been tracked with a precision of a few millimeters over the last
    decade. Until now, there were good theories as to why this happens, but no one
    could really prove it.\n\nNow, however, Geoff Blewitt, University of Nevada research
    geophysicist, has an explanation for this mysterious geo-wobble.\n\n&ldquo;The
    theory, which my colleagues and I have proven using GPS observations of the Earth,
    is that it&rsquo;s likely to be caused by the surface matter being redistributed,&rdquo;
    Blewitt said. Blewitt and his colleagues, Richard Gross, Jet Propulsion Laboratory;
    Peter Clarke, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England; and David Lavall&eacute;e,
    University of Colorado, Boulder; published their findings in an article published
    April 1 in the journal, Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nTo make the Earth wobble,
    large amounts of mass need to be moved from one place to another so that the Earth
    is &ldquo;off balance,&rdquo; according to NASA-funded researcher Blewitt, who
    said the North Pole then adjusts to a new position to compensate. Large amounts
    of water are displaced seasonally when glaciers and ice sheets melt in spring,
    for example. The mass shifts back when they refreeze in winter.\n\n&ldquo;We measured
    the earth&rsquo;s shape directly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It agrees with the wobble.
    What our measurements are showing is that everything is consistent &mdash; the
    earth is wobbling while it&rsquo;s changing its shape,&rdquo; he said.\n\n&ldquo;The
    Earth isn&rsquo;t a perfect sphere,&rdquo; Blewitt noted. &ldquo;It bulges at
    the equator because it&rsquo;s spinning. If the position and height of that bulge
    changes slightly &mdash; even a few millimeters &mdash; we can pick it up.&rdquo;
    \n\nBlewitt will present his findings on why the Earth wobbles in a lecture, &ldquo;GPS
    as a global sensor of systems Earth,&rdquo; at the 2004 Joint Assembly of the
    American Geophysical Union, the Canadian Geophysical Union, The Society of Exploration
    Geophysicists, and the Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society, on Thursday,
    May 20, in the Palais des Congr&egrave;s, Montreal.\n\nBlewitt has contributed
    to four books and co-authored some 60 papers in journals including Nature and
    Science, as well as given presentations and workshops at some 75 scientific conferences
    worldwide. Blewitt has been at Nevada since 1999, with previous positions at the
    University of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena."

    Nick,

    From what I remember in school and what I've read online, the earth's wobble is natural.  From time to time, though, that normal movement becomes more dramatic.   Oil that's removed from the ground is replaced with sea water.  While water is a little heavier by volume, there's not that much of a difference. In fact, I'm pretty confident that nothing humans can do would change the wobble.  Even pumping all of the oil onto the Moon over the course of a week would have a minimal impact on weight distribution of the earth.  The planet's really big and very heavy.

    time as a result of removal of oil from the earth. In many instances it is replaced
    with water. The fact is that water weighs 8 pounds per gallon to oil's 6 gallons,
    Leaving enough a differential to cause a shift in the earth's 24 hour wobble.
    The wobble now is\ngreater and appears Erratic. With a change in wobble occuring
    slowly over 24 hours, there aooears a change of weather as the axis pole changes
    closer or furthe from the sun. Only a small degree is required to make a difference
    in the weather as to wether we have cold or hot temperatures. The earth is like
    a balance scale. What you do to one side changes the other Take out too much oil
    over many years and that's got to happen, The \nchanges that occur in the 24 hour
    wobble are enough to give us the weather that we endure. Maybe the oil cartel
    will bury this article."

    I've been thinking about the earth's wobble and it's "balance".

    Not to mention the changes in the polar ice caps, what effect does all the mining, quarrying and oil drilling have on the earths rotation? Is the earth becoming more out of balance which is causing more earth quakes? Yes, the earth is elastic. The question is though is if we move the masses faster than the earth can "naturaly" fix / rebaklance itself, it would tend to put increased stresses on the tectonic plates causing increased sysmic activity.

    BTW, I'm no scientist, but...........

    Hi,
    It seems to me this "Wobble"you are worried about is very small.Why isn't there
    concern about the 13 degree shift cycle the pole describes every 25,000 years?Is
    earth in a portion of this cycle causing more tilt of the pole toward the sun.No one seems to be looking at this "Wobble".It is huge when you think about
    it.An axis tilt of 21 to 24 Degrees(normal) which can change to 15 to 30 degrees now that is significant!Granted this is only changing the axis about 1
    degree every 72 years, but shouldn't some one be adding this into the research on global warming?

  content: Earth wobble, climate change, movement of the Tetonic plates - I understand
    that water weighs less than oil and in some cases water is replaced when oil is
    pumped out of the earth however water weighs more than oil!  Oil is burned in
    the air and most of its weight is gone.  Water that was pumped into the earth
    to replace the oil that was taken out was gotten from somewhere, so what replaced
    the water that was taken to replace the oil that was pumped?  Also, it took millions
    of years for the oil to get to the stage and place where it is in the earth and
    is part of what makes the earth live as it is.  Oil also is of a different consistancy
    than water.  Oil lubricates the rocks, etc. under the earth and helps to hold
    everything together by its thickness.  Water cannot do this in exactly the same
    way.  Mother Earth is alive and got that way by its natural process and messing
    with that in the trillions of barrels of oil pumped out in a relatively short
    amount of time, I feel, can be the cause of change in weather due to wobble, climate
    change and movement of the Tetonic plates, etc.  Pumping a few barrels of oil,
    no problem but it has gone way too far.  It will now take millions if not trillions
    of years for Mother Earth to replace the oil that is so necessary for it to maintain
    its life.  What about the weight of all the cement buildings, roads, etc. setting
    on the earth in year 2009 compared to (for example) the 1600's? Has anyone every
    figured out how much more weigt we now have on earth?

  content: "So I am interested in the earths wobble and how that is changing the difference
    in weather, and possible magnetic polarity. It seems that this extreme shift (wobble),
    the 21-24 degree wobble every 26,000 years-ish affects the planets weather due
    to the amount of sun parts of the world receive. And extreme wobble could cause
    colder winters and hotter summers (Which is what is happening now, 2009, July
    Hottest recorded ocean temps in south east Asia.) \nAlso, something that needs
    to be brought up is that the earths rotation around the sun is not a circle. It
    is an oval, which due to the earths wobble gets closer to the sun and then farther
    away. So if you could picture the earths orbit as equal distance from the sun
    all the way around, then move the orbit on one side closer....the other side gets
    farther away! These are natural cycles, BUT! with the added amount of CO2 added
    into the air these cycles may very well be being pushed into the extreme which
    does change things at a catastrophic proportion. \nBut I do want to add something
    about the conversations on OIL DISTRIBUTION so far:\nThe matter on the earth is
    neither destroyed or created, it is just changed. For instance you take a log
    it wieghs a certian amount and that is adding to (what you guys have been talking
    about) the wieght of the planet. When you burn that log, the same amount of mass
    still exists on earth it is just a gas now. This gas still contributes the same
    amount of weight on the planet as it did as a log! The air looks like nothing
    but it is something and it has a weight! So I would say that the redistribution
    of oils around the WORLD (if the theory is correct) has changed the wobble. Because,
    the main oil source is from the middle east area (I assume) and all of that is
    being moved to the US, or Asia, or where ever. So that mass is moved in different
    directions all around the world. Then it is burned (like factories producing smoke,
    and cars,and don't get me started on ciggaretts [which I know are not oil. It
    is the concept of the amount of solids that are being turned into gasses]), this
    burning is adding more and more gas matter to the planet. Which moves based on
    winds etc. so what happens when the air becomes heavier? And the winds begin to
    blow? The air is still pushed right? But it now has a larger effect on the planets
    rotation/or its wobble because it is a heavier force that is being moved!"

  content: "50 MYA there was a temperate world, world-wide.  Seas dropped to the mean
    sea-level of about 3 miles; maybe a shallow ocean of less than 200 feet away from
    the Pacific deep.  Then the Med which has been bone-dry, began to fill.  5 MY
    saw us enter into the biota.  \nThe onset of the Ice Ages was thought to have
    began just a few million years ago but cores from Antarctica show it has been
    glaciated over 20 MYA.  Evidence exists of other former once-glaciated places,
    and places now glaciated that never were such as the N Pole.  \n\nT Gold's theory
    of a rise in elevation of a large (S AM) land mass would cause the equatorial
    bulge to ease slowly forward, topple over (90 degrees,) and leave the pole to
    reset.  \nI like simple.  No ice masses to cause polar reset, no crustal slippage,
    just plain geology.  Mountain building.  Of which S Warren Carey saw as the main
    mover of our planet.  Only he saw the mountain building as being produced in an
    expansion event.  One never hears of this now which usually means that the theory
    is being 'rediscovered' and renamed and will only after a quarter of a century
    accrue to its actual discoverer, S Warren Carey. \n\nCurrent books say 3x oceans
    exist inside the Earth; ones from a quarter of a century ago say 30x.  Our moon
    is locked closely due to a strong magnetic field of the earth.  Older research
    shows that 1,000 ya the Earth had an impossibly strong field of 20 gauss.  Now
    it is decreasing rapidly.  \n\nThere is no shortage of theories, speculation,
    heresy, and catastrophic occurrences to explain these anomalies. But I think that
    S Warren Carey will be proven right, with mountains initiating the ice ages.  And
    that T Gold theory expains why the poles do a 90 degree shift in response to the
    new mountain range.  \n\nQuestion:  what was the event which began mountain building?"

  content: I read the main article (by Hennessy) &amp; the first post thereafter (by
    Sudbury).  I'm amazed at such deep thinking, yet both of your posts have errors.  Hennessy
    mentions that "someone keeps an out?"  What's that supposed to mean?  Maybe "an
    eye out?"  And Sudbury's post mentions "molton"!  There's "molton" rock inside
    the Earth?  Are you sure it's not molten?  Yes, I understand that not everyone
    can be smart in all areas, but if you're going to try to convince me about something
    so large as the Earth shifting because of added &amp; subtracted weight, you need
    to show me you seem intelligent.  Being able to spell molten or not leaving words
    out is a great place to start.  Aside from that, it has been assumed for years
    the Earth has a wobble.  I think it's safe to say it contributes to warming &amp;
    cooling cycles.  There!  End of story!

  content: "Voila, I am NOT going crazy. For two years now, I've noticed changes in
    the cloud patterns here in my area (Eastern Canada) They appear more like tropical
    clouds...I've noticed the sun rising and setting in a different place on the western
    horizon...Having a summer cottage with a mountain range across the lake and taken
    many photos, I actually see the sun's setting position is NOT in the same place.
    I haven't felt right about any of this and never really spoke with anyone for
    fear of being labeled nuts. \nI did worry about the amount of oil being removed
    from the earth, and if that has an effect on the wobble, or watching countries
    increase their land mass by taking soil from elsewhere and dumping it along  existing
    shore-lines...listen, the earth is big in comparison to you and me, but when an
    object spins, it doesn't take much to throw it off. Take, for example, the tires
    on a car. They require balancing or they won't spin properly. Weights have to
    be added to correct this. If moved, there will be a wobble. I believe the opposite
    is true, and furthermore, I believe the wobble can be affected when weights are
    shifted. I understand the Earth is not a perfect sphere (otherwise we probably
    wouldn't be here). I did not go to University, or have a science degree. But,
    I am part of this planet and appreciate what it has to offer, and if someone like
    me without charts, satellite imagery systems or anything near what NASA has and
    still notices these changes, I wonder what they know and are hiding? \nIt's unfortunate
    that the truth could cause panic in the general population, because I would really
    like to know the facts about our planet, now more fragile that I could ever imagine.\nI
    wonder how it's affecting bird migrations? How is the water used to fill the empty
    oil fields being replaced? What exactly is the oxygen ratio in our atmosphere
    now that we've cut down so many trees and polluted the ocean and our skies, causing
    gases to build up? \nFor those who are skeptics, I'm happy for you because you
    will go about your day with other worries. Don't belittle those of us who have
    genuine fears...Look at it this way: If we're wrong, we all live happily ever

<p>Do you believe in human-caused global warming?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that the earth wobbles?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know that the Antarctic ice shelf is growing and shifting from one side of the earth to the other?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you answered a throaty, certain "yes" to the first question but a less confident "I think so" to the next two, you better do some homework. &nbsp;Your prejudice toward human-cause global warming could be in danger.</p>
<p>In 1955, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891454,00.html">Time Magazine</a> described the effects of the earth's wobble on climate. &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>If the earth were a perfect sphere, he says, it would not be stable on its axis. The "smallest beetle crawling over it would change the axis of rotation in relation to markings on the sphere" because there would be no force to resist the kickback of the beetle's crawling. But the earth is not a perfect sphere; it is a geoid slightly flattened at the poles by the centrifugal force of its rotation. So it spins like a fat flywheel on the short axis between the poles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough.&nbsp; Most of us learned this in fifth grade science class.&nbsp; But the next paragraph provides an "aha!" moment to people following the global warming debates.</p>
<blockquote><p>But what if the shape changes because of the rise of mountains or the accumulation of glacial ice? In this case, says Gold, the axis will shift to take account of the new distribution of mass. Slowly, the plastic earth will swell in the proper places to make itself a geoid again. When this process is complete, it will settle down with its North and South Poles in new places. Gold figures that modest crustal changes could make the earth turn 90&deg; in less than 1,000,000 years, relocating its poles on its former equator.</p></blockquote>
<p>When we look around for evidence of such enormous changes to earth's weight distribution, we find a stellar example in Antarctica. &nbsp;I could have linked any of thousands of sites for this, but, in the interest of balance, I go with a lefty site, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0520-08.htm">CommonDreams.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast East Antarctic Ice Sheet - a 2-mile-thick wasteland larger than Australia, drier than the Sahara and as cold as a Martian spring - increased in mass every year from 1992 to 2003 because of additional annual snowfall, an analysis of satellite radar measurements showed.</p>
<p>They determined that the icecap appeared to be thickening at the rate of 1.8 centimeters every year. The ice is thinning in West Antarctica and other regions of the continent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, how could that affect the earth's attitude? &nbsp;&nbsp;Let's go back to Dr. Gold's research from 1955:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to one school of geology, something of the sort may have happened many times already. The shift of the poles would explain remains of tropical vegetation found near the present poles and signs of glaciation found in the present tropics. Another proof: the magnetic particles in many ancient rocks do not point toward the present magnetic poles</p></blockquote>
<p>My guess is that someone keeps an out for changes in magnetic North.&nbsp; The problem is that if such a shift is occurring, many irresponsible scientists will ignore it for fear of weakening their claims of human-caused global warming. &nbsp;But such a shift could explain why, for a year now, Asia and North America are getting colder and northern Europe is getting warmer.</p>
