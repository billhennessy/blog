    of requiring Gore to live as he wants all of us to live:  no A/C in summer, no
    heat in winter, an electric car that dies after 40 miles without a charge, and
    eating nothing but the weeds that sprout in unfertilized lawns."

<p>Washinton, DC -- The record cold temperatures and heavy snow in Asia and North America have prompted earth scientists to invent a whole new demand:&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/09/AR2008030901867.html?hpid=topnews">zero carbon emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citing a new generation of computer models, based on scientific speculation that only a decade ago was considered too outlandish to pull off, scientists now claim that even physical exercise is too dangerous and must be banned.</p>
<p>"The steam that rises from a Starbuck's coffee contains enough greenhouse gases to kill three polar bears and wipe out a village in Sri Lanka," said Dr.&nbsp; Phillip Hensen, a geophysicist with the Godlike Space Studies program at NASA.&nbsp; "We must eliminate all greenhouse gases by July 2008, or we might as well launch every nuclear ballistic missile in all the arsenals in the world."</p>
<p>Soccer moms around the country agree, and in Town and Country, Missouri, they're taking action.</p>
<p>"I put a 'Save the Planet: Park Your Car and Walk' bumpersticker on my Escalade," Melinda Carson told Hennessy's Review.&nbsp; "We use E84 or 85, whatever it is, gasoline because it reduces America's dependence on foreign carbon and saves polar bears."</p>
<p>Earth scientist Patti Goebels, an associate professor at Land o Lakes Community College, applauds efforts like Ms. Carson's.&nbsp; "I mean, anything we can do is great.&nbsp; Of course, we really need Congress to ban all carbon emissions and anything that puts off heat.&nbsp; Otherwise, all the polar bears will die, and even Minnesota will be hot and humid."</p>
<p>Asked about the record cold winter in much of North America and Asia, Hensen said it's just more evidence of the validity of the greenhouse theory.</p>
<p>"You have quadrillions of molecules of greenhouse gases trapped in the atmosphere.&nbsp; Of course, it's going to cause colder winters in the northern hemisphere and colder summers in the southern hemisphere.&nbsp; Have you ever sprayed yourself with a CO2 fire extinguisher?&nbsp; All the models predicted this."</p>
<p>Hensen took the opportunity to attack global warming skeptics.&nbsp; "These people, some of whom claim to be scientists, who say 'this is just a scare tactic to win grant money' are actually all employed by the big oil companies.&nbsp; They get <em>paid</em> to lie about the effects of greenhouse gases by the people who hate polar bears and Sri Lanka."</p>
<p>Democrat candidate for President, Barack Obama, responded quickly to the report.&nbsp; "I will do whatever it takes to save the polar bear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hillary Clinton could have saved the polar bear when her husband was president.&nbsp; Instead, she slept with strangers in the Lincoln Bedroom for a thousand dollars a night.&nbsp;"</p>
