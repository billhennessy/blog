<p>We on the right have claimed for years that environmentalist extremists (Al Gore, et al) are motivated by socialism, if not totalitarianism.&#160; In our argument we contend that scientific proof has no meaning to these miscreants.&#160; They are bent on economic and political control, not a healthy eco-system. </p>
<p>If you don't believe us, maybe you'll believe one of them.&#160; </p>
<p>Tipping my hat to Paul at <a href="http://www.jennifermarohasy.com/blog/archives/002835.html" target="_blank">Jennifer Marohasy</a> blog, I draw your attention to a paper by Evan Sandsmark, via <a href="http://climatesci.org/2008/03/10/the-political-issue-of-global-warming/" target="_blank">ClimateSci</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Ted Parsons, a professor at the School of National Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, writes that the promises of air capture could carry a &#8216;moral hazard&#8217; because political pressure for near-term efforts to curtail climate change may be reduced.</p>
<p>Air capture also addresses one of many factors adversely affecting the environment. The climate crisis is a powerful tool to motivate change - like checking the ever-expanding global population and excessive resource consumption - and if the urgency of climate change is compromised, other environmental projects may fall by the wayside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No need for the left to deny what what we've known all along.&#160;&#160; Global warming is lef</p>
<p>tist politics, not science.&#160; It is totalitarianism, not ecology.&#160; is socialism, not conservation. </p>
<p>It's nice to hear the totalitarians admitting their collectivist aims.&#160; It's chilling that they are so emboldened.&#160; </p>
