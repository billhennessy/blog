    It is about time.

    Jeremiah Wright's radical views were no secret.  They have been a topic on talk radio for months while there has been a de facto MSM blackout of Barack's church.  It is interesting that Wright&rsquo;s views were little discussed while Mitt&rsquo;s church received intense scrutiny.  To borrow a phrase, it has taken a while for the chickens to come home to roost.

  content: "Thanks, John.  Actually, Obama just admitted he's known of Wright's anti-US
    and anti-white teachings since the very beginning of his campaign one year ago
    [<a href=\"http://hennessysview.com/2008/03/14/its-only-wrong-if-youre-caught/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>] and [<a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/03/14/obama-calls-chicago-pastors-fiery-remarks-inflammatory-and-appalling/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>].  What a stupid thing to admit.  Barack denounced the
    teachings only because he got caught.  \n\nObama might not be evil, but he's a
    coward."
