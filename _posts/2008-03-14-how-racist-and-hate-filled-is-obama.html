<p>If I said my favorite writer is Adolf Hitler and that my wife hates America, you might legitimately call me an anti-American bigot.&#160; </p>
<p>Barack Obama's wife is unabashedly anti-American.&#160; His spiritual advisor is more so.&#160; That advisor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, hates white people, too.&#160; When the person with whom you choose to live your life and the person from whom you seek guidance for your thoughts and actions are known anti-American bigots, people are justified in assuming you are like them.&#160; You chose them.&#160; You defend them.&#160; You must agree with them.&#160; Right?</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, Rev. Wright told his congregation, "God damn America."&#160;&#160; Barack Obama might as well open his next stump speech with Garrett Morris's song from that Saturday Night Live skit:&#160; "I'm gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see."&#160; </p>
<p>You won't hear about this on the evening news, though.&#160; The big media are doing their damnedest to cover up this black supremicist's comments as they seek to realize his hope, depsite <a href="http://patterico.com/2008/03/13/8297/" target="_blank">Patterico's</a> expectation that this would be lead off news.&#160; </p>
<p>If Rev. Wright is willing to publicly and on video tape lead his congregation in a chant of "God <em>damn</em> America," how bold do think his advice to Obama has been?&#160; And if Obama denounces, in his heart, the Reverend's sermons, then why did Obama retain Wright as his spiritual advisor for 20 years?&#160; </p>
<p>Now, you can say that a politician can compartmentalize his moral beliefs (in this case, racist) from his political beliefs.&#160; But would you trust a politician who routinely supports political ends he believes are morally wrong?&#160; Do you trust the politician who goes to church every Sunday but defies the teachings of his church?&#160; Don't we call them hypocrites?&#160; And if they are not true to God speaking through their spiritual advisors, will they be true to their constituents?&#160; </p></p>
<p>Christians choose a spiritual advisor in the belief that the&#160; Holy Ghost will speak through that advisor, providing insights into thought and action.&#160; Thought and action.&#160;&#160; What advice did the Rev. Wright give Obama over these 20 years?&#160; What advice does Wright provide Obama's campaign as its official spiritual advisor?&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/13/video-obamas-pastor-takes-highly-nuanced-approach-to-racial-divisiveness/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a> sees the same connection I do, and points out that Obama the Hypocrite likes calling white people racists for saying things that are not racist at all.&#160; Obama is a bigot.&#160; As terrible is this sounds, a vote for Obama is vote to punish white people.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>The bad news is that I and everyone who reaches the unavoidable conclusion presented here will be labeled a racist.&#160; Every single one.&#160; That's because most white elites in education, media, and politics, still view blacks as ignorant, weak, flawed creatures who need protection from the normal.&#160; In the liberal's mind, blacks can never be left to sink or swim on their own--they're just too stupid.&#160; For the party of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" target="_blank">Jim Crow</a> and George Wallace, slavery never died--it changed its name to Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>The media and the Obama campaign are now trying to distance themselves from Wright--only two days after announcing Wright will be the full-time spiritual advisor to his campaign.&#160; Even <a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank">CNN</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama and Wright have been close for years. Obama has been a member of Wright's church since his days in law school, and Obama's best-selling book, "The Audacity of Hope," takes its title from one of Wright's sermons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>But judge for yourself who the racists are.&#160; </p>

<p> Obama, Oprah, and their spiritual advisor are anti-American racists.

<p>But some of you bought that "hope" crap Obama's been spewing. </p>
<p>Michelle Malkin offers something real:&#160; [<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/03/13/video-god-bless-america/" target="_blank">click</a>]</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Right now, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/oreilly/index.html" target="_blank">The O'Reilly Factor</a> on Fox News is tearing up the MSM for purposefully ignoring this story. Key point from media analyst Bernie Goldberg: "Most reasonable people would not be a member of that church."&#160; Bingo.&#160; He went on to say, "I have never it [the media] this corrupt."</p>
