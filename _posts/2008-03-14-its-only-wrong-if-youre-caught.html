<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/06obama-lg.jpg"><img style="border-width:0;" height="244" alt="06obama_lg" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/06obama-lg-thumb.jpg" width="192" align="left" border="0" /></a> In a pathetic admission of his own shallowness, Barack Obama admitted that he's known since his campaign began that the Rev. Jeremiah Wright is an anti-US racist.&#160; According to <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/03/14/obama-calls-chicago-pastors-fiery-remarks-inflammatory-and-appalling/" target="_blank">Fox News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama said he never personally heard Wright preach the statements at the center of the controversy, but he first learned of them when he launched his presidential campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For almost a year, Obama has defended the bigot, naming him chairman of the African-American Spirtitual Leadership Committee for his campaign.&#160; Tonight, he issued this attempt at damage-control:</p>
<blockquote><p>I categorically denounce any statement that disparages our great country or serves to divide us from our allies. I also believe that words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it&#8217;s on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great.&#160; But why didn't this denunciation come a year ago when Obama admits he first learned that his pastor of 20 years is an anti-American racist?&#160; Why did Obama knowingly put a racist on his campaign committee?&#160; Why did he defend the miscreant time and time again?&#160; Why, only yesterday, did his campaign state that Rev. Wright would remain on the campaign?&#160; Here's Obama's weak answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>He said he did not leave the congregation upon learning of Wright&#8217;s more divisive remarks, because of his &#8220;strong links&#8221; to the church, where he married his wife and where his daughters were baptized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The would-be President has "strong ties" to a racist, anti-American ass-hat.&#160; Great.&#160; This is the best his party can come up with? </p>
<p>Obama wants us to judge him on his judgment.&#160; So far, his judgment involves <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2008/03/rezko-played-bi.html" target="_blank">consorting with alleged felons</a> and admitted US-haters.&#160; He's married to an anti-American bigot.&#160; And he didn't denounce his pastor's bigotry until the press found out about it.&#160; </p>
<p>Obama shows the judgment of a coward seeking to win the White House by hook or crook.&#160; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; <a href="http://patterico.com/2008/03/14/obama-heres-whats-important-and-i-dont-have-it/" target="_blank">Patterico Pontificates</a> on Obama's judgment.</p>
<p>UPDATE II:&#160; One of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://discerningtexan.blogspot.com/2008/03/vdh-welcome-to-politics-of-change.html" target="_blank">Discerning Texan</a>, has a fantastic long piece on Obama's revealing attempt to distance himself from Wright.&#160; Obama could be finished before Pennsylvania.&#160; </p>
<p>Beginning tomorrow, you will see the greatest flood of liberal lies and spin you've every seen in your life.&#160; The left will go after Bill O'Reilly more viciously than they attacked Rush Limbaugh.&#160; By next week, anti-Fox legislation will come up in Congress.&#160; </p>
