<p>Master quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ugly stuff. But this is also the proudly and openly expressed opinion of every major and minor contributor to The Nation magazine, lots of folks at The New Republic, the loudest members of the anti-war faction, and if my memory for op-eds since the mid-1980s is right, apparently a majority of vocal members of the Democratic Party. Sounds to me like Mr. Wright&#8217;s a problem for Sen. Obama only in that he makes it more difficult for the candidate to disguise his and his followers&#8217; beliefs during the general election.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&#160; Barack Obama has announced that he was never in the church when Rev. Wright preached hate.&#160; If anyone can prove Obama <em>was</em> in the pew for any of these statements, he's done.&#160; He would have to drop out of the campaign.&#160; IMO, he could be done, anyway.&#160; </p>
