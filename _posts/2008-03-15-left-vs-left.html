<p> Someone wise once said that when your opponent is hell-bent on destroying himself, let him. </p>
<blockquote><p>The primary season was just too much for them...     <br />The Left's most popular blog <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/3/14/20827/4727/132/476843"><strong>Daily Kos </strong></a>is imploding faster than <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/03/more-hate-speech-new-video-of-obamas.html"><strong>the Obama campaign</strong></a>.      <br /><strong>The reality-based community is showing clear-cut signs of meltdown.</strong></p>

<p>Recent Rasmussen and Gallop polls support GP's anecdotal evidence.&#160; In the national tracking polls released yesterday and today, McCain would be either Clinton or Obama by at least 5 percentage points if the election were held today.&#160; That's an enormous slide for the Democrats.&#160; Just a week ago, either Hillary or Barack would have beaten McCain by 2 percentage point margin.</p>
<p>Part of this shift is just statistical noise.&#160; But part reflects, I think, the public's distaste for the party of Jim Crow.&#160; If, somehow, Hillary gets the nomination, the violent rhetoric of Rev. Wright will spill over into the streets.&#160; </p>
