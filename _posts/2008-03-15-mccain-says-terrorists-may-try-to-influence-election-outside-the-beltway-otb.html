<p>James Joyner takes note of John McCain's statement that al Qaeda may try to influence the US election to avoid a McCain administration. </p>
<blockquote><p>it&#8217;s not entirely clear why al Qaeda is so desperate to avoid a President McCain. I suppose there&#8217;s some propaganda value to a female president that could be exploited; if anything, the opposite would be true in the case of a President Obama. Do they envision a radically more terrorist-friendly foreign policy?</p></blockquote>

<p>I say, "Yes."&#160; Obama would provide a friendly environment for terrorism.&#160; So would Hillary, but only to a point.&#160; </p>
