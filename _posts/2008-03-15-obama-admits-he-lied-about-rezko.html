<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Others are subtler in their descriptions, but I don't see any other way of stating the case.&#160; Yesterday, Barack Obama admitted to the Chicago Tribune that his campaigns have ac</p>
<p>cepted twice as much money from Tony Rezko than the candidate admitted in the past. </p>
<p>Obama, the candidate of judgment, blames repeated lapses of judgment.&#160; (Perhaps his judgment is impaired only when someone has a large amount of cash.)</p>
<p>Ed Morrissey boils it down beautifully:&#160; <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/14/obama-woes-continue-at-rezko-trial/" target="_blank">Either Obama lies (a lot), or Obama is very stupid</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before going into business with Rezko, we&#8217;re expected to believe that the president of the Harvard Law Review was so naive that he didn&#8217;t read the papers or ask around about his business associate, especially when going in on a real estate deal with a man who was also a major contributor.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s also take a look at that. When Obama&#8217;s connection to Rezko first came to light, he initially told reporters that Rezko didn&#8217;t raise any more than $50,000. Chicago reporters then dug up almost $150,000 in fundraising <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/09/rezko-cash-three-times-more-what-obama-admits-sun-times/">last summer</a>, and Obama was forced to admit that he underestimated Rezko&#8217;s contributions. Now he&#8217;s telling us that it&#8217;s over $250,000. How many more revisions on this story can he make? Will the figure get closer to a million dollars by the time November gets here?</p>
<p>In both situations, the best Obama can ask us to believe is that he is a benighted idiot. He managed to attend a church with a race-baiting, America-hating pastor for twenty years without noticing it. During that time, he did business with a corrupt politico without ever noticing that, too, and he blithely went from election to election without being able to tell the difference between $50,000 and $250,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have noticed <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/03/01/so-obama-lies/" target="_blank">Obama's propensity to lie</a>, to cover, to deny, and to blame others for some time.&#160; As these character flaws reveal themselves, Obama's weakness as a candidate becomes obvious.&#160; His complete lack of qualifications for President are almost frightening.&#160; </p>
<p>The media could have vetted Obama a year or even four years ago.&#160; They didn't.&#160; Instead, they ordained him the Great Black Hope and hoped no one else would notice.&#160; The media--CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, and a hundred others--ignored or covered up any potential flaws or weaknesses in Obama. <a href="http://gretawire.foxnews.com/2008/03/15/new-senator-obama-poll-vote-now/" target="_blank">Greta Van Susteren notes</a> that, even today, the NYT has buried the story, hoping not to embarrass the man the LA Times calls "<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center" target="_blank">The Magic Negro</a>."&#160; Apparently, these people didn't expect he'd be in a tight race against Clinton Inc.&#160; </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Then, again, maybe Obama really isn't all the smart.&#160; Take a look at these two statements from one interview Obama gave yesterday (<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080315/D8VDI3H00.html" target="_blank">AP</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Rezko helped raise up to $250,000 for his various political races, Obama's campaign said. The campaign had previously put the figure at $150,000 but now says that amount was only for his 2004 Senate race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay.&#160; So you lied about the money.&#160; Now, this . . . </p>
<blockquote><p>"He never once asked me for any favors, <em>or ever did any favors for me</em>," the Illinois senator said in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times. "He never gave me any gifts or gave me any indication he was setting me up to ask for any favors in the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please, someone, send me $250K.&#160; I will NOT consider it favor.</p>
