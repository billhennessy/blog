<p>Ace of Spades describes this breaking story as "nuclear" for the Obama campaign.&#160; I agree.&#160; </p>
<p>Obama's only defense in the Rev. Jeremiah Wright scandal was to claim he never heard vitriol spew from Wright's mouth.&#160; Many pundits, including Obama supporters, warned that any evidence putting Obama in that church during an ant-US, anti-white hate sermon would be Obama's undoing.&#160; He'd be a proven petty liar.&#160; </p>
<p>Looks like he is: </p>
<blockquote><blockquote>Wright laced into America's establishment, blaming the "white arrogance" of America's Caucasian majority for the woes of the world, especially the oppression suffered by blacks. To underscore the point he refers to the country as the "United States of White America." Many in the congregation, including Obama, nodded in apparent agreement as these statements were made.</p></blockquote>

<p>The story comes from an August 2007 story on <a href="http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/8/8/194812.shtml?s=lh" target="_blank">News Max,</a> (via <a href="http://antiprotester.blogspot.com/2008/03/barack-obama-agrees-with-reverend.html" target="_blank">Autonomist</a>) allowing the left to discount its authenticity. But it will compel other, more acceptable services to hunt down the people involved.&#160; This will end his candidacy, even if he wins the the nomination.&#160; </p>

<p>**UPDATE** <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/03/busted-obama-knew-about-wrongness-of.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundits</a> runs down additional holes in Obama's cover.&#160; The list includes an <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/03/just-what-did-o.html" target="_blank">ABC News story</a>, filed today, that questions Obama's veracity on three news channels Friday night.&#160; The MSM smells blood.&#160; The ABC Comments include this back-breaker for the Dems:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time in my life, I will be voting for a Republican this November. I am sick and tired of all the hatred, racism, and bigotry in the democratic party. </p>
