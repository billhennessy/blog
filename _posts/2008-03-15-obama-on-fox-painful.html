  content: I also watched the interview on Fox, and my impression was very different
    than yours. I thought he did OK, I also feel some concern about his 20 years at
    the church, and not a hint of any comments like this from his pastor he was aware
    of. I too was shocked when I saw all the video footage of his pastor, and I do
    not condone or excuse any of it in any way. However, after the shock wore off
    a bit, and I saw and read Obama's responses, I must say, in spite of everything,
    it was a more honest response than Hillary Clinton would ever be capable of. And
    it did make me consider the Christian religion as it is being taught today, in
    context with what the scriptures say. I went to Parochial school my first 8 years,
    and have attended church the first 35 years of my life. Nowhere in the bible does
    it say to celebrate Christmas, it is really a Pagan holiday holdover adopted by
    Christianity that celebrates the Winter Solstice. Easter , Easter Eggs, Easter
    Bunny are not mentioned as a celebration in the Bible either, this is the Pagan
    Holiday for the Spring Equinox adapted by Christianity. Barrack's church seems
    radical, but so are most of mainstream Christian TV preachers and their churches.
    Some common and accepted themes we as white, Bible believing folk accept from
    these mainstream churches include, Rev Fallwells assertion that 911 was a result
    of Gods wrath on America for all the abortions, as well as other big name see
    'em every Sunday morning on TV types who claim God has punished New Orleans for
    Homosexual behaviour, that God created America for the express purpose of identifying
    Islam as the work of Satan and his spirits, and America's purpose is to identify
    and destroy from the Earth this work of the Devil. The supposed Biblical theory
    that the more money you give to these TV "churches", the more God will bless you
    with worldly riches, as these accepted mainstream church leaders live in large
    homes, have the most hypocritical and lavish lifestyles while the widows drop
    their last mite into the churches money box. My point is that the Bible does not
    support these perversions of the Gospel and of Gods Holy word. The true Christian
    faith has been twisted, warped and perverted beyond recognition, and we, right
    here in America embrace it every day, because if we agree or not with any particular
    mainstream faith, or teaching, we do not stand against it. We do not feel shock
    by this, as we have become acclimated to these truley strange and perverse teachings,
    that are against the true and real and relevant teachings of the Bible. So now,
    Obama's Pastor comes along, and his cherry picked reel of preaching highlights,
    in truth, are no more scary or over the line than many, many mainstream Christian
    leaders that we gloss over, because their targeted message of perverted teachings
    are targeted to us white folks, and many embrace and accept them and look to these
    who spout this as our "leaders". The same America has sinned concept, except the
    ones who have sinned to cause the calamity to our country from God are not us,
    no, no, it is those unbelievers who have caused this and not us. It is the unrighteous
    who have provoked God and not us, we are the faithful of his church and led by
    our dear Pastor who perverts Gods very teachings, and we say to Jesus, Lord, Lord,
    and He knows us not!! Obama's pastor is only another version of the same theme,
    tailored to those who are in reality the very same as we are. They really have
    been oppressed as a people, and this is reality, a result and the price of slavery.
    America above all in history, deserves honor, respect, and credit She doesn't
    receive for ending slavery and starting on the road to doing what is right, trying
    to fulfill the whole promise of Her inception. So, really, Obama's church is NOT
    shocking, but expected. It is a cultural offshoot of out very own concept and
    teaching of Christianity, twisted and  tailored to fit the need and reflect the
    feelings of their segment or the population. America has come a long way, and
    has far to go, Americans can't seem to face the facts that we, as a nation, have
    wronged many people, and have lifted up many people, all at the same time. Remember
    the American Indians? Our American Government gave them blankets with Smallpox,
    yes, our very government, just as any person, has committed both terrible and
    wonderful things. This causes me to put the whole issue of this whole Obama Pastor
    issue into perspective, as Jesus said, "By their fruits you shall know them".
    Barrack Obama has conducted himself thought this campaign with more dignity and
    respect for his opponents, and taken the high road even when the whole "kitchen
    sink" has been thrown at him than Hillary Clinton could ever muster. This man
    has, and continues to spread a message of hope, trying to bring people together
    rather than tear them down, whatever else he as a Human has done, these are his
    fruits. We as a Nation need to confront the issues at hand and bring together
    and try to heal this country, nothing that Barrack Obama has said or done can
    take away the fruits that he stands for. Even the words of his pastor. He is to
    be judged by the American people by the "fruits" of his words and deeds. I will
    continue to support Barrack Obama. The fruits of the two other Presidential contenders,
    not what they say but what they do, dictate that I must. It is time to stop being
    phoney Patriots and be real Patriots, and focus on the future of our country,
    and I believe that Obama is the best choice to be our next President.

  content: "Thank you, Teaparty51.\n\nFor me, the telling moment of the interview
    came early on.  Major Garrett asked asked a series of staccato, closed questions
    to which Obama quickly fired \"yes\" or \"no.\"  This was set-up on Garrett's
    part.  \n\nNext, he broke the pattern with a long question, ending with, \"Did
    you regularly attend Sunday services at Rev. Wright's church?\" or words to that
    effect. \n\nObama was unready for the query.  He paused, staring into the camera.
    \ He began to speak, then stopped.  Finally, in carefully weighed and measured
    words, he claimed to have been too busy with a child to go every Sunday to church.
    \ \"I went in spurts,\" the silver-tongued Senator said.  \n\nHe might as well
    have said, \"I only went when the Reverend wasn't spewing race hatred and damning
    America.\"  \n\nWhen it comes to lying on his feet, Obama is no Bill Clinton."

<p>( . . . scroll for new video . . . )
<p>I'll be honest:&#160; I take some glee in seeing Barack Obama's campaign come undone on national television.&#160; His interview with <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/" target="_blank">Major Garrett on Fox News</a>, tonight, though,&#160; was difficult to watch.</p>
<p>The normally eloquent and certain Obama was a stammering fool, carefully choosing his words, trying to remember what he'd said before and what's been written by his campaign.&#160; </p>
<p>Interestingly, Obama refused to state that he would have quit the church had he heard the racist and anti-US sermons we've been watching the past two days.&#160; Instead, he said he'd quit if he'd them "repeated."&#160; Garrett gave Obama a second chance to say he'd have left the church if he'd heard such inflammatory sermons.&#160; Again, Obama qualified his answer, saying, "If I heard them repeated."&#160; </p>
<p>We can assume, then, that Obama heard Wright's rants, but since the minister always brought fresh racist material to the pulpit, the junior Senator stuck with it for 20 years.</p>
<p>Just one picture of Obama in the pews while Wright slings hate, and he's done.&#160; </p>
<p>Update:&#160; <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/03/15/jeremiah-gate-glowbamas-losing-his-glow/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a> took away the same impression from the Fox Interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wow. You could see Glowbama&#8217;s halo flickering. He looked and sounded nervous, shifty, and truth-challenged as he tried to have it both ways with Jeremiah Wright (whom he continued to praise as a &#8220;Biblical scholar&#8221; and &#8220;well-regarded&#8221; even as he paid lip service to disavowing him and denied eeeever hearing Wright&#8217;s vitriol). </p>
