<p>Today's <em><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9062.html" target="_blank">fatwa</a></em> from the new pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, the separatist and anti-American church in which Barack Obama bends his knee, places a pivotal decision before the senator:&#160; he is either with them or against them.</p>
<p>The church, whose manifesto and pastor spoke indefensible words of separatism and hate, could have taken its lumps, reformed, and move on.&#160; Instead, under the direction of the Reverend Otis Moss II, it came out swinging.&#160; Moss accused the media and society at large of character assassination and "crucifixion." </p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly three weeks before the 40th commemorative anniversary of the murder of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.&#8217;s character is being assassinated in the public sphere because he has preached a social gospel on behalf of oppressed women, children and men in America and around the globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If chanting&#160; "God damn America" and visiting Muammar Qaddafi with the anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan helps the oppressed, then spitting into one's palm while spinning three revolutions on one's right foot will cure cancer. </p>
<p><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/16/character-self-assassination/" target="_blank">Ed Morrissey</a> on Hot Air&#160; points out that elsewhere in the church's release, Moss speaks of his church as "inclusive and global."&#160; Well, only if you don't count Caucasians.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>The reaction puts Obama in a difficult place.&#160; Having sworn to stand by the church while superficially denouncing its former pastor's hate speech, Obama, now, must decide which principles guide his public life.&#160; If he stays with and defends his church, he leaves behind his pretence to bridge-building.&#160; If he leaves his church, he admits that the roots of his philosophy were diseased since germination.&#160; </p>
<p>This is a no-win for Obama.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
