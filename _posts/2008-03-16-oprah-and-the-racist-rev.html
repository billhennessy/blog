    I don't know a lot about this Wright chap, but what I do know is that he caused a bit of a fuss by suggesting that September 11th 2001 may have been a result of American foreign policy. Unfortunately, however you spin America's global activities in the past 60 years, this is true.
    Instead of just assuming that because a sentiment is anti-American it must be false, try looking it up. Who armed Bin Laden? Who armed Saddam? Embarrassing, isn't it?

    Oprah is a racist. She had her DNA analyzed and she said she was "happy" to find out that she had no white ancestors. If a white person said the same thing, it would be considered a racist remark.
    Race is accidental. We have more in common than we have differences. People who make a huge issue of race are trying to divide Americans instead of bringing us together.
    Jerry Wright is slime. So is Al Sharpton. So is the head of the KKK, whoever he is. So are all racists.
    Oprah is an entertainer. that's all. She is no better than the rest of us.

  content: Oprah gives advice on relationships, but has a boy friend who is a door
    mat ... gives advice on marriage, but has never been married ... gives advice
    on child rearing, but has no children ... gives advice on Obama, but was a member
    of Jeremiah Wright's anti-American racist church for several years. Now, her white
    women's audience, which made Oprah rich, wants to know more about Sarah Palin,
    but Oprah says NO !!!

<p>I watched tonight's edition of one my favorite shows, "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition."&nbsp; Following is Oprah's Big Give. </p>
<p>I was never a huge Oprah Winfrey fan, but learning that she chooses an anti-American racist as her minister poisoned whatever good feelings I might have had for her.</p>
<p>Differences between races because of cultural histories are certain.&nbsp; Oprah and Obama, though, demonstrate, in their allegiance to Reverend Wright, a moral corruption that cannot be papered over with soothing rhetoric or million dollar giveaways.&nbsp; At some point, penance comes due. </p>
