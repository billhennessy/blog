<p>With a week separating us from Obama's Race speech, we can look to the real lesson it taught:&#160; Barack Obama lacks the personal courage required of leaders.</p>
<p>Since the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy reached the tipping point with The O'Reilly Factor on Thursday a week ago, Obama has pointed many fingers and blamed many people, including his "typical white person" grandmother.&#160; But most politicians dodge blame.&#160; What demonstrates Obama's remarkable lack of courage was his direct dealings with a man he professes to love:&#160; the Rev.</p>
<p>Obama admits that he witnessed Wrights vituperations against whites and against America.&#160; Obama claims such speech offends him.&#160; I'll grant him that, finally, he's admitted the truth. </p>
<p>A leader, though, would have confronted his mentor in private.&#160; A leader would have attempted to spare his friend additional embarrassment.&#160; A leader would have risks their friendship to save Wright's soul and reputation.&#160; A leader would have.&#160; Barack didn't.</p>
<p>Other men are tested under battle in uniform.&#160; Some are tested with the loss of a child or when only their own honesty separates them from great wealth.&#160; In Obama's case, it seems Providence tested him with Rev. Wright's outspoken race hatred and anti-patriotism.&#160; But the child-senator from Illinois proved to be too timid, too weak to help his friend see the light.&#160; Instead, Barack placated and enabled Wright's great weaknesses until those weaknesses consumed the both of them.</p>
<p>Like all weak men, Obama will fade into the scrap heap of history soon.&#160; He will be forgotten, and it's too bad--he offered something, just not enough.</p>
