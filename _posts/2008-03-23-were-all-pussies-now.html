    if anything, your post sounds more like from a Nazi/Fascist.

    not everyone who is a "rag-head" (as you pointed it out) is a terrorist.

    perhaps you receive joy when you watch clips like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxi5kxzx3V0

    Wilders Movie Website, Network Solutions, Is Caving Into Radical Islam.

    Website http://www.fitnathemovie.com/ is down: "This site has been suspended while Network Solutions is investigating whether the site's content is in violation of the Network Solutions Acceptable Use Policy. Network Solutions has received a number of complaints regarding this site that are under investigation." Read more: <a href="http://muslimsagainstsharia.blogspot.com/2008/03/is-wilders-movie-website-network.html" rel="nofollow">http://muslimsagainstsharia.blogspot.com/2008/03/is-wilders-movie-website-network.html</a>

    Muslims Against Sharia neither endorse nor condemn "Fitna"; we have not seen the film. However, we find it disturbing that Network Solution suspended "Fitna" website while hosting a multitude of radical Islamic websites, some of which belong to (or are closely affiliated with) terrorist groups.

<p>According to <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/03/22/will-any-american-company-host-fitna/" target="_blank">Michelle</a>, (h/t <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/22/hosting-company-pulls-the-plug-on-geert-wilderss-anti-islam-movie/" target="_blank">allahpundit</a>)Network Solutions, a wimp of web hosting known for overcharging customers ($35 for a domain name registration), brought down the web site promoting Geert Wilder's new film, Fitna: the movie, citing complaints from rag-head terrorists.&#160; </p>

<p>I say, let's bring down Network Solutions, the Herndon, Virginia-based Internet serviced provider. The company was recently purchased by <a href="http://www.generalatlantic.com/usa/people/team.asp?sb=p" target="_blank">General Atlantic</a>, who should hear from you.&#160; (CEO is William E. Ford.&#160; Chairman is Stephen A. Denning.)&#160; The company would love to hear from you:</p>

<p>In the meantime, Hennessy's View would be proud to serve as a mirror for the film.&#160; If you don't think we're all pussies, yet, then check this out from <a href="http://stoptheaclu.com/archives/2008/03/03/free-expression-quashed-youtube-removes-blasphemies-against-islam/" target="_blank">Stop the ACLU</a>.&#160; </p>

<blockquote><p>Wilders told FOX News in January that he believed Western culture was better off than the "retarded" Islamic culture and likened the Koran to Adolf Hilter's book, 'Mein Kampf.'</p>
