<p>The U.N. Secretary-General is quite furious at Denmark for permitting Geert Wilder's film "Fitna" from seeing the light of day, according to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN2844232220080328?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true" target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Freedom must always be accompanied by social responsibility," Ban said.</p>
<p>"We must also recognize that the real fault line is not between Muslim and Western societies, as some would have us believe, but between small minorities of extremists, on different sides, with a vested interest in stirring hostility and conflict," Ban said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny.&#160; When his own organization calls for extermination of Jews or death to Christians, he calls it the U.N. doing its job.&#160; The U.N.'s job, then, must be annihilation of the West. </p>
