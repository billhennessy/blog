<p>The much ballyhooed link between hurricanes and global warming appears to have snapped.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/tech/news/5693436.html" target="_blank">Houston Chronicle</a> story describes the findings published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (a GW alarmist pub):</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most influential scientists behind the theory that global warming has intensified recent hurricane activity says he will reconsider his stand.</p>
<p>The hurricane expert, Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, unveiled a novel technique for predicting future hurricane activity this week. The new work suggests that, even in a dramatically warming world, hurricane frequency and intensity may not substantially rise during the next two centuries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If reality occupied the same universe as Al Gore, this news might disturb that criminal.&#160; This means that any attempt to blame the coming hurricane season, Katrina, or Andrew, on human activity (aside from building in the path of hurricanes) is mere pseudoscience, like everything else associated with global warming. </p>
