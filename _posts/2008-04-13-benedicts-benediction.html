<p><a href="http://www.ewtn.com/USPapalVisit08/index.asp" target="_blank">Pope Benedict XVI will receive the highest honor</a> the United States can bestow upon on a visiting head of state: the President will meet him at the airport.&#160; Afterwards, the White House will host the largest gathering of Bush's presidency, as over 12,000 guests will receive His Holiness.&#160; Quite an honor.&#160; </p>
<p>Sadly, Catholic hate mobs will be out in force, too.&#160; Excommunicates who believe they know God's designs for the church better than the Pope will travel from St. Louis to embarrass themselves and the church they refuse to obey. </p>
<p>Why would a Methodist president show more respect for the Pope than cradle Catholics?&#160; </p>
<p>Pride.&#160; <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080413/D9013J1O4.html" target="_blank">Donna Quinn</a>, a former nun excommunicated recently by St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke, wants to be a priest.&#160; Her pride drove her to separate from her church.&#160; Presidents are proud men at some level, but this one is not so proud as to blind him.</p>
<p>Benedict continues a rejuvenation of the church that John Paul II began.&#160; In this reform, the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s begin receding.&#160; The old prayers are returning as the church remembers that ancient admonition:&#160; <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_orandi,_lex_credendi" target="_blank">lex orandi, lex credendi</a></em>.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.fathercorapi.com/" target="_blank">Fr. John Corapi</a>, a preacher every Catholic should know well, tells of a meeting late in the Second Vatican Council.&#160; The Cardinals took turns extolling the virtues of "fresh air."&#160; The idea was to renew the church by opening the windows, metaphorically.&#160; </p>
<p>As Corapi tells it, an old French Cardinal sat and listened for hours.&#160; As the proceedings neared a close, he rose to speak.&#160; He said, "Openness is good, and we could all use some fresh air.&#160; But be careful.&#160; When you throw open the windows, you might let in fresh air.&#160; You might let in every stench from the gutter, too."</p>
<p>Donna Quinn's perverted, disordered views, her self-importance, her pride, result from those gutter stenches that wafted into our churches when we threw open the windows.&#160; The poor woman never received the education, the formation that the church knows to give.&#160; Like so many modern Catholics, she learned a disordered catechism penned by men, not by God.&#160; The spirit that moved the church's leaders were not of Heaven, but of profanity.</p>
<p>Thank God that our president will give Pope Benedict his due.&#160; May the world, and particularly Catholics, see his visit as the chance to return to the church Christ ordained, following the shepherd He left to tend His flock.&#160; And may Donna Quinn and I be in that number.&#160;&#160; </p>
