<p>The thinking, scientific world owes much to James Joyner and Arthur Brooks for <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2008/04/gun_owners_not_uneducated_poor_or_bitter/" target="_blank">this piece examining the socio-economic</a> background of American gun owners.</p>
<p>Principle findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gun owners are happier than non-owners (Barack's prejudice debunked)</li>
<li>Gun owners earn more than non-owners (Barack's preju</li>
<li>dice debunked)</li>
<li>Gun owners are equally educated with non-owners (Barack's prejudice debunked)</li>
</ul>
<p>Barack Obama's "bittergate" comments served to debunk the Barack myth.&#160; He is neither transcendent nor particularly intelligent.&#160; Instead, he is a narrow, prejudiced, little man, made ignorant by the vapid idiots who surround him.&#160; His anti-American wife, his anti-white spiritual leader, his terrorist friends have filled his welcoming head with lies.&#160; </p>
<p>The lies Obama believes are the kind of lies that demand action.&#160; His race for President is his attempt to pay back the people who harmed him, but only in his perverted imagination.</p>
<p>Just say "no" to Chicago-style ignorance.</p>
