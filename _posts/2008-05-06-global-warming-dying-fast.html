    foreseen Global Warmism. He said: "The object in life is not to be on the side
    of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane."'

<p>The global warming hoax of the past decade, which reached a climax in 2006-2007, is in rapid decline.&nbsp; <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/03/06/abcnews-gives-up-on-global-warming/" target="_blank">I'm no longer</a> <a href="http://web.mac.com/sinfonia1/Global_Warming_Politics/A_Hot_Topic_Blog/Entries/2008/5/2_It&rsquo;s_All_Unravelling.html" target="_blank">the only one noticing it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to that the news of a couple weeks back that <em>no one</em> in an <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/04/19/abc-poll-gw-rates-a-big-fat-zero/" target="_blank">ABC News poll of 1,197</a> US adults named Global Warming as an issue in this year's elections.&nbsp; No one.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp; Zip.&nbsp; Ain't huntin'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In desperation, then, <a href="http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2008/20080506160205.aspx" target="_blank">Al Gore today</a> pronounced the Myanmar Hurricane a result of non-existent global warming.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Al Gore makes money on global warming.&nbsp; So today's pontification is, effectively, his attempt to cash in on a tragedy--like the carpetbaggers who descent on natural disasters and bilk the people out of their remaining cash on the promise of repairing their homes.&nbsp; (Many, many sincere carpenters and constructors also travel to disaster scenes to help.&nbsp; I'm not calling them out or comparing them to Al Gore.)</p>
<p>What does this mean?&nbsp; </p>
<p>It means that it's okay to swim against the theoretical flow.&nbsp; It's okay to enjoy your SUV, to not say you're "green," to eat beef, to keep comfortable, to put real bygod gasoline into your car, to cut the lawn with a gas mower, then fire up the grill to seer some steaks.&nbsp; Pop a Budweiser, releasing the naturally produced CO2.&nbsp; The greenhouse bubbles will help carry the aroma of hops and natural beechwood aging to your olfactory nerves, enhancing the beverage's crisp, satisfying flavor.</p>
<p>You earned it, my friend; you survived Global Warming.</p>
