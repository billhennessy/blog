<p>Here's some environmental-like news I like.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><p>Dutch researchers at the Technical University of Delft have developed what they say is the world's first solar-powered speedboat, and it's got all the luxurious trimmings one would expect.</p>

<p>No, I'm not panicked about greenhouse gasses, I do like effective methods of starving the oil barons in the Middle East.&nbsp; A luxury boat that runs on sun power is one great start.&nbsp; Now, if they can do the same for my Jeep Commander, all would be well. </p>
