<p>The <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/06/17/hey-associated-press-you-owe-me-at-least-132125/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>, long upset that people often quote and link to its stories on the internet, has imposed a $2.50 per word fee for bloggers who wish to quote one of its stories.&#160; </p>
<p>I understand.&#160; It's tough to have a lot of people driving web traffic to your site.&#160; Considering the number of articles attributed to the AP, the cost of servers and bandwidth must be outrageous.&#160; </p>
<p>But I have a solution:&#160; Stop posting stories on the internet. </p>
<p>I have scientific proof that this will work.&#160; For several months, I did not blog at all.&#160; During that period, not a single blogger linked to or quoted any blog post I wrote.&#160; </p>
<p>Here's how I see it:</p>
<p>1.&#160; Cancel all your web hosting contracts.</p>
<p>2.&#160; Take the money you save, and teach your reporters how to write.</p>
<p>3.&#160; Reserve some cash with which to research your stories for factual accuracy.</p>
<p>4.&#160; Hire many, many lawyers to scour the internet looking for violations of any of your rules and policies.</p>
<p>Did I leave anything out?&#160; </p>
<p>From now on, I'm going to Reuters.&#160; The Associated Press can go to hell. </p>
