  content: I was kicked off a demookie chat program for simple asking questions.  Why
    want the Democrates help see that justice is still a no 1 program in America and
    help the two border guards in Texas.  Why are they so set to give america away
    to anyone who wants it.  Where are they when the laws of our countryis not reconzied
    anymore.  Where are they when Mexico turns a killer lose that killed our bourder
    guard?  I've been a Democrat for 50 years and have never seen them this mixed
    up.  Is like going to H^^^ in a handbasket and the democrates trying to get there
    first.  Why is an illegal mexcian more important than an AMERICAN/

<p>Barack Obama's poll lead over John McCain has plummeted from 51-35 to a statistical dead-heat in less than a month.</p>
<p>Obama's downward spiral has Newsweek's headline writers asking if <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/145737">his glow is fading</a>. The polls finds that more than half of voters consider Obama lying opportunist who will take any position for votes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama's rapid drop comes at a strategically challenging moment for the Democratic candidate. Having vanquished Hillary Clinton in early June, Obama quickly went about repositioning himself for a general-election audience--an unpleasant task for any nominee emerging from the pander-heavy primary contests and particularly for a candidate who'd slogged through a vigorous primary challenge in most every contest from January until June. Obama's reversal on FISA legislation, his support of faith-based initiatives and his decision to opt out of the campaign public-financing system left him open to charges he was a flip-flopper. In the new poll, 53 percent of voters (and 50 percent of former Hillary Clinton supporters) believe that Obama has changed his position on key issues in order to gain political advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is very bad news for a man who is <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/07/12/a-commander-in-chief-who-fears-the-military-vero-possumus/">afraid to debate his Republican rival</a>, counts <a href="http://www.stoptheaclu.com/archives/2008/02/23/obamas-terrorist-friends/">terrorists among his best friends</a>, and has been caught in <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/06/21/mark-shields-obama-couldnt-pass-a-polygraph">numerous lies</a> throughout the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/03/01/so-obama-lies/" target="_blank">campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Democrats: you might have nominated the only person who can't beat a Republican this fall.</p>
