    Hey, I saw your headline, "Rasmussen Poll Shows Dead Head", but there's nothing in the story about the Grateful Dead or their fans.  What's up with that?

<p><a href="http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/daily_presidential_tracking_poll" target="_blank">Rasmussen's presidential tracking poll </a>shows a dead heat between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain (h/t <a href="http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/daily_presidential_tracking_poll" target="_blank">Drudge</a>).&nbsp; This poll confirms the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/07/12/newsweek-obama-fading/" target="_self">Newsweek </a>poll showing the two in a statistical dead heat.</p>
<p>Moreover, according Rasmussen, McCain enjoys higher favorability ratings than Obama.</p>
<p>Considering that McCain has received little media attention since the last Democrat primary in June, Obama's 15 percentage point drop can only be blamed on Obama's dismal performance as a candidate.&nbsp; The more people learn about this unknown, affirmative action Senator from Illinois, the less they like him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/07/13/nyt-notices-obama-disgust-on-far-left/" target="_blank">Ed Morrisey</a> notices that the far Left is growing impatient with Obama:</p>
<blockquote><p>the far Left appears to be people who switched from the Green Party to Democrat because of Barack Obama.&nbsp; Now some of them have switched back out of disillusion</p></blockquote>
<p>Morrissey continues with a point that mirrors my own observations:</p>
<blockquote><p>The transformative veneer has been stripped from Obama, leaving the opportunist exposed for all to see.&nbsp; Obama may have peaked already.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Obama continues to faulter--and there's no reason to think he won't--look for Operation Chaos to rise again in Colorado.&nbsp; Hillary's supporters might be able to throw&nbsp; the convention open to a delegate fight that will make the final season of the Sopranos look like a kindergarten game of musical chairs.</p>
