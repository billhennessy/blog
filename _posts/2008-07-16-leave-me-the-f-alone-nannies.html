<p>It took the nanny-staters to more than a minute to scream at low-carb dieters like me about the Mediterranean Diet study released today.</p>
<p>The study shows that Atkins-like, low-carbohydrate diets are the most effective kind for both weight loss and good health.&nbsp; That joys me, because the only way I can lose and keep of weight is with low carbs.&nbsp; Even when I was running half marathons, I was well over 200 lbs on a 6-1 frame.&nbsp; That's really hard on the tendons and joints.&nbsp; I landed on my back for a week with an Achille's tendon so inflamed the doctor thought it would rupture walking from his office to my car.</p>
<p>But the nanny worriers--the people who insist on telling me what to eat, smoke, drink, think, wear, and fondle--immediately blasted the study with a bunch of crap arguments, like this one from <a href="http://thespartandiet.blogspot.com/2008/07/mediterranean-diet-research-deeply.html" target="_blank">The Spartan Diet </a>blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>subjects get an alcohol point for consuming from one to three glasses of alcohol for men and slightly less for women. That means drinking zero alcohol -- the healthiest option, assuming the rest of your diet is healthy -- is treated the same as drinking a bottle of scotch every day. The upper end of this scale -- <em>three glasses per day</em> -- is enough to develop chronic alcoholism.&nbsp; [Emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Three friggin' glasses a day is chonic alcoholism????&nbsp;&nbsp; That would make me . . . Dean Martin!</p>
<p>I'm sure the writer has a product to hawk, but leave it alone.&nbsp; I'm not on the Med Diet, but it sounds like a great way to save some people from diabetes, heart disease, and 48-inch waists.</p>
<p>The American Heart Association has good but non-commital things to say about the Med diet <a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4644" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Eric of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-admin/A bigger surprise: The low-carb diet improved cholesterol more than the other two. Some critics had predicted the opposite." target="_blank">Health and Survival Blog</a>--a committed-sounding name if I ever heard one--found that low carb diets lower cholesterol better than low fat diets.&nbsp; So there.</p>
<p>Go read it for yourself on the <a href="http://nejm.org" target="_blank">New England Journal of Medicine.</a></p>
