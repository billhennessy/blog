<p>On Friday, the New York Times refused to publish an op-ed piece by Republican nominee John McCain (<a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/07/21/mccain-campaign-says-new-york-times-blocked-op-ed-response-to-obama/" target="_blank">FoxNews.com</a>).&nbsp; This might be the first time in American history that a newspaper turned down a column by a presidential candidate from a major party.&nbsp; According to Jonathan Martin of <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0708/NYT_wanted_timetables_in_McCain_oped.html?showall" target="_blank">Politico</a>, the Times demanded that McCain include "timetables" for withdrawal if he wants NYT inches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also demonstrates why liberalism is incompatible with democracy.&nbsp; Liberals are totalitarians by nature.&nbsp; They seek to limit others rights in order to maximize their own interests.&nbsp; David Shipley, the former Clinton hack who rejected McCain's piece, said it didn't meet the paper's pathetic standards. Hey Shitley:&nbsp; I just flushed a piece of paper that exceeds the New York Times' standards.</p>
<p>What do you want to bet that this Shitley character donated $2K to Obama and has an unhealthy interest in young boys at the club swimming pool?</p>
<p>I was lukewarm toward McCain until this week. Between the 24/7 ass-kissing by the MSM of Obama's subversive trip to countries whose names he can't spell and the NYT finally pulling the last straw on reason, I've had it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Better dead than living in Obamanation.&nbsp; (See Gateway Pundit for<a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/07/pathetic-obama-says-he-would-still.html" target="_blank"> Obama's latest anti-American </a>crap, as that communist f*ck credited the goddam Sunnis, not the Surge, for progress in Iraq.) America and the world would be better off if Obama never made it back from Sandland.</p>
<p>Michelle Malkin <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/07/21/maverick-discovers-that-msm-libs-are-not-his-friends/" target="_blank">thinks it funny</a>&nbsp;that the very psycho libs McCain sucks up to now ask him to bend over for their fellow.&nbsp; I find it frightening.&nbsp; The left will do anything--anything at all--to win this election, and we should be prepared to do anything to stop them.</p>
<p>Think I'm imagining this liberal bias?&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/belief_growing_that_reporters_are_trying_to_help_obama_win" target="_blank">Rasmussen </a>(h/t Malkin):</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey, taken just before the new controversy involving the Times erupted, found that 49% of voters believe most reporters will try to help the Democrat with their coverage</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, half the country realizes that the David Shipley will lie, cheat, steal, and kill to win this thing for his boy.</p>
<p>The poll reveals how tolerant Democrats are of cheating:</p>
<blockquote><p>a plurality of Democrats&mdash;37%-- say most reporters try to offer unbiased coverage of the campaign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lying bastards.&nbsp; May they all rot in hell.</p>
<p>But there's more from Rasmussen.&nbsp; People believe that the media are trying to kill the American economy, put you out of your house, and sell more great American companies to Eurotrash idiots like Carlos Brito.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A <a href="http://hennessysview.com/public_content/business/general_business/50_say_media_makes_economy_look_worse_than_it_really_is" target="_self">separate survey released this morning</a> also found that 50% of voters believe most reporters want to make the economy seem worse than it is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Duh.&nbsp; They also invented human-influenced global warming.&nbsp; They're evil.&nbsp; Not just different the way Poodles are different from Labradors, but evil.&nbsp; Mean.&nbsp; Out to hurt people for their own pleasure.&nbsp; David Shipley would have been highly decorated at Auschwitz.&nbsp; He'd have done a fine job of reviewing the Jews' appeals for release.&nbsp; "Nein, and it's time for your shower."</p>
<p>I'm disgusted.</p>
