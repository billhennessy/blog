<p>The best Obama round-up is on <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Gateway Pundit</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obama's so anti-American and so, well, stupid, that it's difficult for me to keep up with his antics.&nbsp; It's nice to know that someone has it covered.</p>
<p>By the way, you cannot vote for Obama and call yourself and American patriot.&nbsp; Unless you're really dumb.</p>
