    Your comment about polar bears floating down the Mississippi reminds me of the polar bear which was discovered a couple of years back with brown spots.  This was supposedly proof of global warming because a brown bear mated with a ploar bear, apparently.

    So, some brown bear decides to take a short vacation up north during the warm season, gets lucky with a local girl, and this is indisputable proof of anthropogenic global warming requiring me to turn off my AC during Texas summers and commute my 25 miles one way by walking.

    You bring up George Soros, the man behind the Ubermessiah.

    This man is not a dupe; he is pursuing his own adgenda, along with Maurice Strong. These two are following their own paths (I don't think they've joined forces) to world domination. They may be ahead of themselves, but they have demonstrated the right approach to taking control of useless UN  international bodies for their own purposes.

<p><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/06/james_hansen_abusing_the_publi.html" target="_blank">Brian Sussman </a>writing on American Thinker, for one.</p>
<p>In an article titled, "James Hansen:&nbsp; Abusing the Public Trust," Sussman writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Topping it all, Hansen has allegedly received hundreds of thousands of additional dollars to further politicize the issue of global warming.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/NASA%20James%20Hansen%20and%20the%20Politicization%20of%20Science/article9061.htm" target="_blank">According</a> to <em>Investors Business Daily</em>, "How many people, for instance, know that James Hansen, a man billed as a lonely &lsquo;NASA whistleblower' standing up to the mighty U.S. government, was really funded by [George] Soros' Open Society Institute (OSI), which gave him &lsquo;legal and media advice'?&nbsp; That's right, Hansen was packaged for the media by Soros' flagship &lsquo;philanthropy' by as much as $720,000, most likely under the OSI's &lsquo;politicization of science' program."</p></blockquote>
<p>So Hansen takes cash under the table to channel George Soros's twisted mind.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Perhaps he'll use his windfall profits to buy some thermometers that work.&nbsp; Or <a href="http://www.climate-skeptic.com/2008/07/why-does-nasa-o.html" target="_blank">maybe he won't</a>&nbsp;(h/t <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/07/20/why-does-nasa-giss-oppose-satellites/" target="_blank">Anthony Watts</a>).</p>
<p>Update to my post of last night:&nbsp; I got a lot of hits thanks to National Review's Edward John Craig on <a href="http://planetgore.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGNhODEzNDc1MTQ5YTM2MGFjZWFhZjFhZDQzMDBjNDA=" target="_blank">PlanetGore</a>.&nbsp; Gracias, Se&#241;or!</p>
<p>The high today in St. Louis was 70.&nbsp; Average for this time of year about 90.&nbsp; Luckily, we managed to keep the kids away from the polar bears floating down the Mississippi on ice floes.&nbsp; I wonder what 70 F translates to on the <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/latest-noaa-press-release-in-total-disagreement-with-nasa-satellite/" target="_blank">Hansen Scale</a>?</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2008/07/24/global-warming-update-debate-definitely-not-over?referer=sphere_related_content" target="_blank">NewsBusters </a>has touched off a continuing battle amongst the AGW crowd.</p>
