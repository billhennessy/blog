<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/arrogance_122.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8465 alignleft" style="margin:10px;" title="arrogance_122" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/arrogance_122-300x257.gif" alt="" width="300" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>Barack Obama's most conspicuous quality, if you want to call it that, is shameless arrogance. His trip abroad was like <a href="http://www.hitlerpages.com/pagina44.html" target="_blank">Hitler's tour of Italy </a>in 1938.&nbsp; Before you dismiss my view as that of a party hack tearing down the opposition, read <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/07/arrogance_wont_win_the_electio.html" target="_blank">Susan Estrich's column </a>on FoxNews.com. (Estrich was Michael Dukakis's campaign manager in 1988).</p>
<p>First, Presidential candidates rarely campaign in war zones, and for good reason.&nbsp; American politics traditionally sort of stopped "at the water's edge," as the saying went.&nbsp; It was never completely true, but more mature politicians took steps to appear that they put their country before their parties and candidacy.&nbsp; Not this ass.</p>
<p>Second, he hold himself immune (with the help of a fawning press) from the consequences of his own words.&nbsp; There is seemingly not an issue on the planet on which he does not simultaneously hold 3 or 4 mutually exclusive positions.&nbsp; Pointing this out earns his scathing, superior, Harvard put-down.&nbsp; "You're not smart enough to undertand the complexity of my mind," he seems to tell us.</p>
<p>Third, in his Germany speech, he told the world that it should allow him to remake it in his image and likeness.&nbsp; As we know, many people in <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/gerard_baker/article4392846.ece">many countries bristle</a> at American calls to adopt our ways.&nbsp; When a first-term Senator travels to Europe to tell them they fucked up the planet and only he can fix it, well, that gives a whole new meaning to "<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/07/25/laughing-at-the-lightworker/" target="_blank">ugly American</a>."</p>
<p>Fourth, he <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/07/26/new-mccain-ad-obama-didnt-visit-the-troops-in-germany-because-he-couldnt-bring-cameras/" target="_blank">dissed wounded troops in Germany </a>and, like a petulant four-year-old, blamed it on the Pentagon.&nbsp; We now know that the Pentagon had made elaborate preparations for his visit.&nbsp; Obama personally <a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/07/obama-landstuhl.html" target="_blank">turned his back on the troops </a>when he learned that there would be no photo-ops.</p>
<p>Fifth he turned the Wailing Wall into a campaign headquarters and lied about where the Obama posters came from.&nbsp; This act of arrogance brought shouts of "<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/07/23/obamas-latest-campaign-prop-jerusalems-western-wall/">Jerusalem is not for sale</a>," from the locals who were offended by his crass commercialization of a holy place.</p>
<p>Americans (63 percent according to <a href="http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/63_say_trip_does_not_make_obama_more_fit_to_be_president" target="_blank">Rasmussen</a>) don't believe the trip made him more presidential.&nbsp; In a separate poll, 45 percent say <a href="http://rasmussenreports.com/scoreboards/by_the_numbers2/by_the_numbers" target="_blank">Obama's too inexperienced </a>to be president.</p>
<p>His trip seems to prove that 45 percent right.&nbsp; Not only was it the work of a man inexperienced on the world stage, it gave a sense of naivite and immaturity to a man who seriously lack gravitas to begin with.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/us/politics/26cnd-obama.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;adxnnlx=1217111447-ZnX23mSdwkGkRDV/XAmsLg">mad wanderings a very arrogant candidate</a>.</p>
