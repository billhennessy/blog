<p>Everytime I've debated the death penalty with a bleeding-heart, I've heard this question:&nbsp; "Would you pull the switch" or its equal.&nbsp; It's only fair to turn the question on them.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, if you read this blog, please answer this question:&nbsp; Would you kill child who survived an abortion with your own hands?&nbsp; (Thanks to <a href="http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2008/08/breaking_news_n_1.html" target="_blank">Jill Stanek</a> via&nbsp;<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/11/obamas-abortion-lies/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>Barack Obama, as chairman of an IL state Senate committee, voted down a bill to protect live-born survivors of abortion - even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language, copied from a federal bill passed by Congress without objection in 2002, explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The smartest thing about Barack Obama is his suit.&nbsp; <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/11/change-you-can-believe-in-obama-is-pro-baby-murder.php" target="_blank">Cassy Fiano </a>has the complete story and says Obama won't get out of this one.&nbsp; We'll see.</p>
