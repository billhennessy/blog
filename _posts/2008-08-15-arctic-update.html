<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/15/goddard_arctic_ice_mystery/">Steven Goddard </a>has an update on Arctic sea ice levels, and it looks like the skeptics are right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also found that the National Snow and Ice Data Center (leftist) is falsified its graph to show more melt than actually occured.</p>
<p>The most certain equation in science is L = l(f) where L = lie, l = liberal, and f = "fact."</p>
