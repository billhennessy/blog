  content: Just heard about this this morning and if he is going to go to jail, half
    the military should be in jail. This one got me, "From a legal point of view,
    there is no difference in law between war and peace" Are you kidding me, that's
    what you think? Those bullets flying by and your dead friends, that the same as
    it is in peace. This guy is obviously a whack job. We should organize something
    and show up to support Nazario at his trial.

    Having the honor to serve in the Corps for over 5 years, this was a slap in the face to me and all of our miltary troops past and present making daily sacrifices so we may take for granted freedoms enjoyed every day. What gives a civilian jury the background knowledge and experience in a Urban combat zone to determine guilt over innocence. This is an out rage to what our society has become. The American should rally together on this one and show these men and women we absolutely support them, despite individual opinions of Iraq and Afghanastan.

    Semper Fidelis,

  content: Stop supporting murders.  Just because he is a marine, that does not mean
    he represents America or our ideals.  Just because he was a marine, that does
    not believe he is law abiding, truthful, and honest.  Just because he was a former
    marine, that does not make what he did right.  He claims he is innocent.  He claims
    that this didn't happen.  Then why do others at the home, even others who are
    being prosecuted, Weemer and Nelson, admit that it happened and blame Nazario?  Don't
    stand for something when you don't understand what he did!  Don't support a former
    marine just because you don't recognize the truth!  This lying marine claims it
    did not happen when even the people who are faced with the same criminal charges
    in military court admit that it did, but blame Nazario for it.  If he is this
    honest truthful marine, why doesn't he stand up and admit what he did.  Let the
    jury decide if we should hold our military men accountable for killing Iraqis.  If
    they acquit, fine he gets off.  But, don't lie about what happened.  That former
    marine is just like every criminal who chooses to make up a false story to convince
    the jury to acquit.  Why doesn't that allegedly honorable marine admit the truth?  He
    is dishonorable and an embarassment to our country.  As Americans we stand for
    truth, justice, and the American dream.  That former marine is just hiding behind
    his attorneys making false claims that this never happened.  Even if he gets off,
    he will have to face his maker.

  content: |-
    The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act was narrowly written to primarily prosecute people "employed by or accompanying" U.S. armed forces who commit crimes while working for the US overseas.  From what I've read, legal and military law experts define this to mean contractors and their employees who are hired by the US Dept. of Defense and other federal agencies - NOT present or former military personnel.  I'm guessing that in order to delineate the extent to which the Act may be applied, federal lawyers have elected to indict those, i.e., Jose Luis Nazario, who have allegedly committed crimes in the combat zone, but were not disclosed until after the end of their service, where previously military law would have applied.  Unfortunately, Jose Luis Nazario's combat experience in Fallujah will be used to define whether former military personnel turned civilian, can be prosecuted under this Act.

    I've never experienced combat, but suspect that this is a far different reality for which our moral and civilized standards, governed by federal and state statutes, simply do not apply.  I always thought that this was why military law was aptly written.  Similarly, I don't think civilians, without any prior military and/or combat experience will be able to decide "beyond a preponderance of the evidence" whether Nazario is innocent or guilty.  Heaven help us, if our military personnel are blocked from performing combat duties during a time of war, for fear of later indictment and prosecution.  I'm afraid that if Nazario is found guilty, our US military will become powerless, done in by our own legal system, potentially exposing all US citizens to the threat of slaughter committed by our enemies, who do not live by the same moral and civilized standards that we would so stupidly apply to our military personnel.  How sad....

  content: US Military Members....past and present...please unite and fight this injustice!  You
    must make a stand now.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  This is a tragedy and
    an injustice.  Obviously, as one can tell from the comment posted by "Be Fair",
    the general public has no concept of the military chain of command or of military
    life and it's demands and sacrifices.  If you Service Members do not stand up
    now for yourselves and your fellow Members, you will never again be able to confidently
    stand up for America, for you will constantly be second guessing and doubting
    her allegiance to you.  And, in my opinion, rightly so.

    without a jury of his peers? 12 Riverside civilians can hardly be considered peers
    of this decorated Marine. Furthermore, how do you convict someone of a crime when
    the victims are all unknown? Regardless of what the prosecutors allege, how can
    you even prove that these unknown victims ever actually exsisted? \n\nAs to the
    debate on charging military with civilian crimes, why not open this up to charging
    civilians with military crimes? I'd love to see how the American people like living
    up to the higher standards we live with. \n\nGood luck Sgt Nazario,"

    Dear Jose Luis Nazario
    I am 100% on your side!
    I know how it feels to be on the Right Side and being discriminated by every perverted bastard in town.
    Since the righteous have to work for himself or die, I am opening a new construction/landscaping business in New York City. Small, but, with a lot of knowledge, energy and plenty of talent to compete with the big guys.
    Check my website and if you are interested, I may have the right opportunity for you. Elegantlandscapedesigns.com
    The great majority of americans support you, they are just too afraid to speak out. They fear losing their jobs or being sued by the pervert, wako environmentalist and socialist bastards.
    Oh, before I forget, I am a 911 victim and I appreciate what you did for us.
    President Bush, as the Commander in Chief shall have the cojones to just pardon you, no questions asked!
    Sincerely,
    Hermelindo

  content: "Being the daughter of Kevin B Mcdermott, the lead  defense attorney for
    Nazario, Ive been there everyday in court taking notes and watching the prosecutors
    despartely trying to make a case out of nothing but what witness' \"say\" they
    have seen over in Iraq. However, now these two lead witness' are mostly likely
    going to be held in contempt and are not testifying under any circumstances.  \nAlso
    how can one rely on a witness to recall what really happened when they are suferring
    from PTSD?????\n\nSo the prosecutors really have nothing to go on and if this
    trial is not found in the favor of Nazario, American society we'll really see
    what our legal system is all about\n\nThese team of lawyers together teamed up
    to defend Nazario with my father as lead  and are doing all of this legal work
    for free\n\nSo if you people really want to help out society to defend the military
    innocence go to http://www.unitedamericanpatriots.org/\nand make a denoation $1,5,10,100,
    or 1000 will make a huge impact and will go to a greater good \n\n-make a difference\nstand
    up for what you believe in, dont buy into the government pricks who have never
    even encounter a war field or had to experience his or her best friend dying in
    your arms, this federal court doesnt know anything about the military law, its
    a joke\nso, come to court and give your support for Nazario's sake and his lawyers\nplease
    go, you are very welcomed\nwe want to fill the court room, we want Narzario to
    know he is in the best hands and is supported GREATLY\n\nUnited States District
    Court, riverside\nlocated on the corner of lime and 12th street in RS\n2nd floor,
    court room:1\n\np.s.\nFor those who think he is guilty, we'll give you a gun and
    send you into Iraq, and you can rely on making the correct decisions well hoping
    desparetly your not convicted of doing what you were COMMANDED to do\nso once
    you have experienced war, you can come talk to us"

    I need to start by saying that I am against the war in Iraq, but the gentlemen serving over there are absolute heros in my book. My Uncle just returned from his tour, and I can not imagine what it would be like if they were to put him on trial for something that happened over there. This is just a way for them to test a new law and they are dragging someone, who by every account that I have read, is an exemplary Marine. Mr. Nazario I will keep you in my prayers and don't let this get the best of you.
    And to the members of his squad who refuse to testify, keep up the good fight sirs!

    Hello,

    I am  Jose Nazario's aunt. I want to thank you all and on behalf of our family for your prayers and support. Yes these are difficult times for us. I am the oldest and to see my young sister suffer while she watches her only child who risked his life by going out into the battlefield and fight for our freedom only to come home and once again be forced to engage in a battle right in his own back yard just doesnt make any kind of sense.  We are trying to stay focused and pray that this nightmare ends soon and Jose and fellow officers are allowed to enjoy living the rest of their lives with their families. I tought that was the American Way. They have served our country.  And to  Mr. Perez, thank you so much for your offer, I will forward your information to him and his family. Once again thank you all, and God Bless.

    government and include this slimeball traitor in depositions, and testimony.  He
    should make this gutless coward's life a living hell.  I hope that I should be
    lucky enought to run into him sometime in life.

  content: Yeah, I guess you have to be on the battlefield to realize that it's okay
    to shoot up a civilian family.  Whatever...morals are NOT relative to whether
    you are on a battlefield or not...right is right, and wrong is wrong.  Civilian
    vs. soldier distinctions are nothing more than pathetic attempts to justify heinous
    actions.  Civilian juries couldn't possibly know how to judge right from wrong
    in the fast-paced chaos of the battlefield.  Yeah sure, that argument is about
    as intelligent as saying, "If you never played pro football, then you are not
    allowed to comment on it, and you can't possibly be an expert."  It is simply
    a vacuous argument (go ahead...I'll wait while you look up that word).

    ...so he got away with something...This knuckle-dragger belongs in jail...Do the guilty nightmares still haunt you, Sgt. Nazario....

    THESE PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK!!  You who say things like this do not deserve the freedoms these current and former military  men and women have given their blood to afford you!  Don't call yourselves Americans and don't put your hand on your chest when you hear this Nation's anthem.  And God help you if you ever need the protection of the military inside this counrty.  You won't and don't deserve it!  YOU MAKE ME SICK to be able to sit behind your keyboards and say things like this!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!

    Sgt. Nazario, Cookie, the Nazario family....I can't tell you how much this has been on my mind and the minds of so many other Americans.  We have prayed and wrestled with this along with you and THANK GOD, good sense prevailed.  This was a travesty and an injustice to you all.  Thank you for serving this country.  Thank you for putting your lives on hold and for risking everything to do the job that was asked of you.  Thank you for remaining a Marine through it all.  Thank you for remembering what the bottom line is.  America called and you answered.  That's more than these idiot posters out here could or would ever do and, like one of the decent posters said, they don't deserve to even breath the same air.  Put this behind you.  Live your life.  My prayers will be with you.  I pray for your prosperity, God's comfort, success and that you'll be able to enjoy ALL the freedoms your selfless acts, and those of all the military members before you have given to us all.  Thank you, thank you, thank you and may God Bless you and yours.

  content: Jerri, You're nothing special.  Many "civilians" could serve in the military
    if they wanted to do so.  I think all Marines started as civilians at one point
    in time.  Your ability to use logic is obviously strained.  According to your
    uneducated argument, if anyone EVER has a problem with the actions taken by particular
    Marines, then that person should be kicked out of the US...or better yet, losers
    like Sgt. Nazario could take them into a back alley and execute them...apparently
    he's quite qualified for that job.  I support the military, you dumb ass, my father
    was in the Air Force.  I don't support soldiers blowing away civilians and other
    soldiers providing illegal cover-ups (they were charged for failing to testify).

    Oh, Jerri...I forgot two things:

    1) Stop shouting...it makes you sound uneducated

    2) gfy

    I don't have to ask what's wrong with you...your stupidity is glaringly obvious.

    Dearest Rob,

    I would like to remind you that you have supported the war since its beginning, so you have no room to talk. These "heinous" crimes that you say are happening, yep, you support them. How? You pay taxes! If you're so against the war, you could have done what some other people have done and volunteered your time instead of getting paid for it. But yeah, you support the war too. :)

    news, my mother and I hugged and laughed. I was a former wife of a Marine who
    recently passed. My brother is also a former Marine. I'm sure this news makes
    them both overjoyed, as it does us all.

  content: I have had Nazario on my prayer list since the day charges were first brought
    against him. We cannot afford to let the liberals in this country  to bring our
    heroes to trial every time they perform their duties while defending our country.The
    law that allowed this trial to even get to a courtroom, should be abolished before
    it ruins the life of our brave military men and women who choose to serve our
    country.I say we bring charges against John Murtha for his lies that have led
    to these needless trials.

    Hello Fellow Supporters,

    Thank you all for your continued prayers and support. Our Family is very greatful for the good news. Goes to show that God was also on Jose's side. God sat on that jury along with the other jurors. Even the jury though all made up of Civilians knew wrong from right. If you all personally knew Jose, You would see that he seems like he had nothing to hide.  Obviously He became a Sergeant for good reason. He can be very focused under hard times. That is what our great service personnel is about. He is also like your normal caring nephew, son, brother. We thank those Men and Women who were selected to handle such a difficult case. And for those people with the 'NEGATIVE" comments, it's no wonder you can't enlist. Only men and women who are allowd to enlist must have a "POSITIVE ATTITUDE" during these matters. Thank goodness for that. I'm glad you weren't part of Jose's squad. It's people like you that would make unnecesary mistakes during battle and risk  our troops lives. So please continue to stay home and hide behind your pc. where you belong. The world is a lot safer without you on our streets or battlefield.

    What is wrong with some of you folks?  Do we live in Sparta, where the military rules the state?

    No, we do not, and those in the military are responsible for facing charges if they violate the law.  But, time and time again, when US forces have been involved in situations that involved the deaths of civilians, these cases have been swept under the rug and ignored.

    It is a disgrace to the conduct of our military in foreign countries.  Yes, the majority of our uniformed men and women are professionals, but when anyone is involved with illegal conduct, it must be pursued by the military to the full extent of the law.

    Sadly, that rarely happens, especially with cooperation of the participants, unless their conscious and honesty gets the better of them and they come clean to the prosecutors.

    "War is hell," which is why force should be used only when necessary to avoid the sort of circumstances that embroiled Mr. Nazario.  And yet, some of you still support this war and then attempt to shrug off any time our military forces are involved with unnecessary civilian casualties.

    If, indeed, Mr. Nazario was involved in the murder of these unarmed civilians, then he will have to live with it for the rest of his life, and it will be between him and the judgment of his maker.

<h4>UPDATE:&nbsp; Here's <a href="http://warchronicle.com/TheyAreNotKillers/Fallujah04/DefendOurMarines.htm" target="_blank">a link to a defense fund </a>for Sgt. Nazario and his brothers who have been coerced into testifying against him by the rogue Federal Persecutor, Jerry Behnke. I've made my <a href="http://www.unitedpatriots.org/donate.php#donatewarrior" target="_blank">donation</a>; please make yours today.</h4>
<p>Federal prosecutors, emboldened by leftist anti-military groups, will persecute a former Marine for alleged murder committed while he was on active duty in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A former Marine sergeant facing the first federal civilian prosecution of a military member accused of a war crime says there is much more at stake than his claim of innocence on charges that he killed unarmed detainees in Fallujah, Iraq.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,405164,00.html">FOXNews.com - Ex-Marine Questions Prosecution in Civilian Court - Politics | Republican Party | Democratic Party | Political Spectrum</a></p>
<p>After Murtha's failed attempt to convict innocent Marines at Haditha, now the Justice Department is going after former service members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why, then, would any ever sign up for military duty?&nbsp; The left will come after you until you're dead or in jail.&nbsp; Nazario's attorney frames the matter well:</p>
<blockquote><p>This boils down to one thing in my mind: Are we going to allow civilian juries to Monday-morning-quarterback military decisions?</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the answer is "yes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Bush should grant Nazario an unconditional Presidential pardon immediately.&nbsp; Don't let this trial begin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nazario said he was on his first deployment when his squad entered Fallujah, which he described as a "high combat zone" with insurgents taking shots at troops at every turn &mdash; with everything from AK-47s to rocket-propelled grenades.</p>
<p>Thirty-three in his battalion were killed in the battle. The first, he said, was a man in his squad. Nazario later received the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal with a "V" for valor for combat and leadership in Fallujah.</p>
<p>Though Nazario was not physically injured, he was later found to have post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>After leaving the military, Nazario worked as an officer with the Riverside Police Department and was close to completing his one-year probation. He said he knew nothing of the investigation until he was arrested Aug. 7, 2007, after being called into the watch commander's office to sign a performance review.</p></blockquote>
<p>Disgusting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; More on <a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/05/marine-jailed-o.html" target="_blank">Black Five</a>, including the prosecutorial abuse of a fellow Marine by US Attorney Jerry Behnke.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Although there is no forensic evidence (no bodies, graves, grieving family members, Iraqi witnesses, damage, etc.), the US attorney filed charges against Nazario and ordered Nelson to testify before a secret grand jury.&nbsp; Sergeant Nelson refused.&nbsp; The US attorney offered immunity from charges in Federal and military courts.&nbsp; Nelson refused three times - the last, on his knees in prayer, tears streaming down his face, but resolute, knowing he was going to jail for not complying with the judge's orders. The judge, US District Court Judge Percy Anderson, charged Nelson with contempt.</p>
<p>Sergeant Jermaine Nelson spent Memorial Day weekend in jail in LA.&nbsp; He is still imprisoned and will appear before Judge Percy Anderson tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sergeant Nelson's attorney said that one of the reasons that he did not testify against Sergeant Nazario was because Nazario had saved his life several times.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;More disgusting still.&nbsp; Stop the Justice Department!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to Black Five, here's the persecutor's contact info.&nbsp; Be careful what you say or write--no doubt this bastard will come after anyone who even smells like a veteran.</p>
