  content: Well, obviously they put McCain in that room for a reason. If Barack says
    McCain heard it or who ever than something must have happened. Just like Spygate
    helped the Patriots ,we don't know how much this helped McCain. Stop hating on
    Barack and you run for president.

  content: "\"You can bet he was the recipient of grade inflation for minorities throughout
    college.\" \n\nThis article is reprehensible. Your racist statement that I quoted
    above is offensive. What I love is that you are ripping on Obama's intelligence
    and speaking ability when he is obviously a more intelligent person than you and
    most Americans and most certainly a better speaker and more intelligent human
    by far than your loser of a president Dubya, that asshole neocons like yourself
    plagued our country (and the world) with for the last 8 years."

    One thing about Rebpublicans, they fight to the death, and they take no prisoners.  I never get a warm fuzzy feeling from them.  Religous babble maybe?  Yes.  But do I see people that live by the book they read on Sundays?  No.  Pro-life for babies?  Yes.  Pro-life for adults (whether it be our soldiers or Iraqi and Afghani citizens)?  No.
    What a bunch of hypocrital morons.  We liberals may not be perfect either, but at least we're not so forcefully preaching one philosophy while so obviously living by another.

<p>The day after John McCain handed Barack Obama his ass on a platter at the Saddleback Forum, Obama's paid mouthpiece, Andrea Mitchell, accused McCain of cheating (see <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/d-s-hube/2008/08/17/nbcs-andrea-mitchell-floats-idea-mccain-cheated" target="_blank">Newsbusters</a>).&nbsp; I guess going mano-a-mano with a real man is <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/08/17/obamas-an-idiot-on-abortion/" target="_blank">above Obama's paygrade</a>, too.</p>
<p>How pathetically consistent.&nbsp; Barack Obama's childishness, immaturity, and lack of accountability grow to new legendary heights every passing day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't know how people can take this brat seriously.&nbsp; He lies like a rug, he cries like a baby when things don't go his way, he cannot form<a href="http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/17/obama-deciding-when-a-baby-gets-human-rights-is-above-my-pay-grade.php" target="_blank"> a coherent English sentence </a>unless it's written, rehearsed, and printed on a teleprompter.&nbsp; He has accomplished nothing except for carefully following the scripts of his handlers his entire life.&nbsp; You can bet he was the recipient of grade inflation for minorities throughout college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months ago, I found myself sort of liking Obama.&nbsp; That was when I first started looking at him as a possible nominee for the Democrats.&nbsp; Day by day, though, I have come to loathe this childish bastard.&nbsp; His smarminess, his conceit, his phoniness.&nbsp; He's as fake a porno movie orgasm and half as orginal.</p>
<p>Barack Obama might well be the worst candidate every nominated by a major party--George McGovern and Walter Mondale included.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12594.html" target="_blank">McCain campaign calls out NBC's </a>Andrea Mitchell as an Obama hack, NBC News as a partisan ad agency for the DNC.&nbsp; Get 'em John!</p>
<p>UPDATE II:&nbsp; <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/18/sore-loser-obama-and-obamedia-accuse-mccain-of-cheating/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin's </a>mocking of The Obama is a classic.&nbsp; Wizbang's <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/17/obama-campaign-accuses-mccain-of-cheating-andrea-mitchell-dutifully-carries-obamas-water.php" target="_blank">Kim Priestap </a>is flabbergasted that Andrea Mitchell and Obama can be this childish.</p>
