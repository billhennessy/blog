  content: Carly, people like you make me sick.  You don't want your tax dollars spent
    on something you do not like for instance the abortion.  But do not feel any remorse
    having your children and having tax money of people that have no kids pay to educate
    them.  Like we care how smart or stupid your child is.

  content: Travis you should care very much about the education of today's children...they
    are the ones who will be running this country when you are old.  I am sure you
    are completely unaware that the US is now 24th in education, way behind much less
    fortunate countries.  You might want to keep current on US affairs.

  content: "In 1933 the humanist manifesto was published, it was more than just a
    creed for atheists, it was a roadmap \nwhich layed out the plan to infiltrate
    schools, churches, and media with the humanistic philosophy and thereby successfully
    brainwash the American People into accepting the communistic/socialistic/atheistic
    worldview that now exists where science is god and absolute truth does not exist.
    \ Travis, Gone, and Murph are an example of the gameplan realized. To those of
    us with God given common sense we must not bother arguing with these brainwashed
    individuals, we must simply pray for them and keep our eyes on the Lord through
    the reading of God's word."

<p>To say Barack Obama's intellectual stamina is weak is like saying Georgia's a bad vacation destination right now.&nbsp; (Georgia the republic, not the state.)</p>
<p>Under the brilliant title "Obama's Paygrade = E-0" comes this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night the Obama was asked when an unborn child got legal rights. Like the spineless political tool he is he refused to answer stating that it was above his pay grade. The reason his answer matters is that he supports abortion on demand even when a child accidentally survives and lives outside the womb.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/">BLACKFIVE</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, in Obama's view, when in</p>
<p>doubt, stick a kid in a blender and press puree.</p>
<p>Carly Fiona has more on <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/17/obama-deciding-when-a-baby-gets-human-rights-is-above-my-pay-grade.php" target="_blank">Wizbang</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>He knows his views on abortion are not in line with most Americans, even pro-abortion Americans. He's got an <em>extremely</em> radical position on abortion, including most recently a record that came to light where he voted against <a href="http://www.cassyfiano.com/2008/08/change-you-can-believe-in-obama-is-pro-baby-murder">babies who survived abortions</a> being allowed to live. He calls Margaret Sanger, the racist eugenicist founder of Planned Parenthood, <a href="http://www.cassyfiano.com/2008/07/the-obamamessiah-loves-margaret-sanger">one of his heroes</a>. He's voted for partial-birth and late term abortions. He's got a <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in-congress/congressional-record-on-choice/illinois.html">100% approval rating on abortion</a> from NARAL and <a href="http://www.nrlc.org/Election2008/obamarecord0608.pdf">a 0% rating from the NRLC</a>. He's voted against parental notification for minors to get out-of-state abortions (even though it made an exception for the health of the mother). He's a co-sponsor of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1173">"Freedom of Choice" act</a>, which would nullify all limitations on abortions. He's voted against the Hyde Amendment, which banned the use of taxpayer funding for abortions through Medicaid (so according to him, pro-lifers should still have to pay for women to get abortions -- nice.).</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly.&nbsp; Just one more reason why I <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">hate</span> can't stand that son-of-a-bitchin'&nbsp; commie from Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/08/obama-says-right-to-life-coalition-is.html">Gateway Pundit</a> reports that the Idiot from Indonesia has accused us of lying about his voting record on abortion.&nbsp; As usual, Obama is wrong.&nbsp; In fact, he's the liar.&nbsp; This time, a whole lot of people with a whole lot of indisputable facts have shown Obama for the shallow, weak, liar he is.&nbsp; They've posted the Illinois Senate vote in which Obama backed the murder of children who survive abortion attempts.</p>
