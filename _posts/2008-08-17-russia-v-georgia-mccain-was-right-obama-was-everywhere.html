  content: "Obama! an uneducated 5th grader, did you even run spell check!!  Its dumb
    uneducated people like you who vote for Mccain cause you don't realize all the
    BS that comes out of his mouth.  Some of you are using terms like terrorist or
    arab to describe him cause his middle name sounds arabic.  Seriously, I hope he
    gets in and implements the reforms he promised.\n\nDo you realize that Georgia
    bombed S. Ossetia first?  Didnt the US launch a war in Iraq to defend the freedom
    of others as well?  \n\nGet ready for a bi-polar world. The US can't boss people
    around anymore.  haha in your face."

  content: Talk about BS.  Take a look at Obama's rhetoric and his actual positions
    and records. Wake up America.  Obama would be one of the greatest mistakes this
    country could make by electing him president.  Liberals are voting for their personal
    agenda, not for someone who has no experience (no experience in crucial leadership)
    to run this country.  Extremely far left (liberal) who is willing to put down
    the values this country was founded on.  (And that is a matter of record)

    Do you feel as strongly about this with the news coming out today that the Georgia/Russia conflict wasn't as black and white as originally depicted?

<p>We've had a week to look at our two presidential candidates' handling of the largest foreign policy incident <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/news/newsreleases/8bc62ef0-6a47-4fb9-9ac0-315fedf346c4.htm"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/posterblog-win.jpg" border="0" alt="posterblog_win" width="184" height="244" align="right" /></a>so far this campaign.&nbsp; In this crisis, we saw the&nbsp; difference between a strong man and an insecure boy.</p>
<p>John McCain, who warned us a long time ago that President Bush's evaluation of Putin was naive, called the matter <a href="http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/shared-blogs/ajc/thinkingright/entries/2008/08/15/mccain_showed_best_how_to_reac.html" target="_blank">right from the start</a>, according Jim Wooten in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.&nbsp; McCain, who once said that he looked into Putin's eyes and saw "a 'K', a 'G', and a 'B',"&nbsp; held one, single, defining position throughout the crisis:</p>
<p>The implications of Russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic Georgia. Russia is using violence against Georgia, in part, to intimidate other neighbors &ndash; such as Ukraine &ndash; for choosing to associate with the West and adhering to Western political and economic values. As such, the fate of Georgia should be of grave concern to Americans and all people who welcomed the end of a divided of Europe, and the independence of former Soviet republics. The international response to this crisis will determine how Russia manages its relationships with other neighbors. We have other important strategic interests at stake in Georgia, especially the continued flow of oil through the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which Russia attempted to bomb in recent days; the operation of a critical communication and trade route from Georgia through Azerbaijan and Central Asia; and the integrity and influence of NATO, whose members reaffirmed last April the territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty of Georgia.</p>
<p>As I said, McCain was firm, consistent, and correct throughout the crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obama, on the other hand, was a like fifth grader who failed to study for an oral geography quiz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, Obama endorsed Russia's invesion.&nbsp; Next, Obama said he would have no position until a clear winner emerged and some polling data could be analyzed.&nbsp; Finally, Obama repeated what McCain said.</p>
<p>When picking a president, let's pick the one who doesn't have to wait for a poll or a grown up to tell him what's right and what's wrong.&nbsp; Obama can't seem to figure out much on his own.&nbsp; Without McCain feeding him lines, he'd still be clapping to Rev. Wright's diatribes against America.&nbsp; Without a fawning media, he'd still be rigging elections on Chicago's south side.&nbsp; Without grown ups to tell him what to say, he'd still be editing articles for a college magazine.</p>
<p>When you have a choice between a man and child for president, choose the man. Choose McCain.</p>
