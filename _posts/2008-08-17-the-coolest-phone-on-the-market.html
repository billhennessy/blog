<p>[caption id="attachment_8520" align="alignleft" width="204" caption="Neonode N2 Black"]<a href="http://FileURL"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8520" title="neonoden2" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/neonoden2-204x300.jpg" alt="Neonode N2 Black" width="204" height="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I like tiny phones that do a lot.&nbsp; The Neonode N2 from Neonode is the coolest phone I've ever seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Totally touchscreen (no buttons)</p>
<p>* Tiny (smaller than a credit card)</p>
<p>* Holds up to 32GB music, videos, photos</p>
<p>* 2 Megapixel camera</p>
<p>* Great sound quality</p>
<p>Watch this CNET Reviews video, then look below to find out how to get this $500 phone for $199.</p>
<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/neonode-n2-black-unlocked/4505-6454_7-32815659.html">Neonode N2</a></p>
<p>Get it for $199</p>
<p>A glitch with the first generation of the Neonode means you can get the second generation for less than half price while owning a piece of the company.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Buy some Neonode (NEON) stock for $0.30 cents a share (as of close on 8/15)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Buy phone under the<a href="http://investor.neonode.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=62246&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1177224&amp;highlight="> Friends and Family program </a>for $199</p>
<p>The stock price tanked after the company recalled every single N1 phone to fix a bug.&nbsp; That shows this company cares and will stand behind its products, by the way.&nbsp; With prices at the 52 week low, you can own a piece of the comapny and the phone for about $220.&nbsp; Not bad.</p>
