<blockquote><p>After hours staking out Joe Biden's Delaware home with no sign of the prospective VP candidate, reporters are now witnessing a flurry of activity.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/22/activity-at-the-bidens/">CNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time Blog Archive - Activity at the Bidens &laquo; - Blogs from CNN.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;UPDATE:&nbsp; <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/" target="_blank">Wizbang coverage</a>.</p>
<p>Barack Obama might the Democrat's Bob Dole.</p>
<p>I quit writing "The Hennessy Report" for Town Hall in 1996 because I was so sickened by the combination of President Clinton and Candidate Dole.&nbsp; The GOP nominated Dole because "it was his turn."&nbsp; Helluvaway to pick a president.</p>
<p>In 1996, the Republicans ran a bassackwards ticket.&nbsp; The more electable, more charismatic, more conservative candidate, Jack Kemp, was on the bottom of the ticket.&nbsp; Had Kemp been on top, Clinton might well have been a one-term president.&nbsp; But, noooooooo; we nominated Bob "Third Person" Dole and got beat like a drum.</p>
<p>Barack Obama has been a weak candidate since about March.&nbsp; He won the nomination because his camp had a superior strategy for winning delegates according the Democrat rules.&nbsp; Once people started paying attention, though, Barack started to look less shiny.</p>
<p>Since "winning" the nomination in June, Obama's campaign has been a disaster.&nbsp; Only George W. Bush's unpopularity has saved Obama from free-fall, a brokered convention, and excuses for why the Democrat delegates turned on him and nominated Hillary Clinton in violation of the Democrats' stated rules.</p>
<p>Despite an 8 to 1 press coverage advantage over McCain, Barack has fallen from 12 point to a 0 or -5 point lead thanks to great campaigning by McCain and terrible campaigning by Obama.</p>
<p>So he picks Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Biden was the best choice among the Democrats who ran this year.&nbsp; He has "gravitas," which Obama does not.&nbsp; He has experience, which Obama does not.</p>
<p>But Biden does nothing as vice president, because no one votes for vice president.</p>
<p>By selecting Biden, Obama admitted he is incapable of running the country.&nbsp; In so doing, Obama has given the Republicans the last piece of evidence they need to convince Americans that there is only one choice this year:&nbsp; John McCain.</p>
<p>BTW, CNN just reported that the media <strong>will not</strong> report Joe Biden's gaffes.&nbsp; Thanks, CNN.&nbsp; We knew you'd cheat.&nbsp; And they've used the term "gravitas" three times, admitting that Obama has none.</p>
