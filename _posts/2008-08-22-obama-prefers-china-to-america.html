<p>On August 21, Obama thought the mics were off. They weren't. They picked up the Democrat candidate's glowing report on the quality of life in China. Obama also <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/22/obama-know-where-its-really-great-to-do-business/">encourage US businesses to relocate operations in China</a>:</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s watching what&rsquo;s going on in Beijing right now with the Olympics. Think about the amount of money that China has spent on infrastructure. Their ports, their train systems, their airports are vastly the superior to us now, which means if you are a corporation deciding where to do business you&rsquo;re starting to think, &ldquo;Beijing looks like a pretty good option.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow. The man who wants to be POTUS tells business that Beijing is "a pretty good option" for location.</p>
<p>Apparently, Obama is the least informed man in America about the standard of living in Beijing. In the run-up to the Olympics, massive, international protests deplored China's horrible human rights abuses that continued right up until the opening ceremony.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beijing's rampant slums were cleared and replaced with happy facades to hide the poverty, misery, and despair from international media and visitors.</li>
<li>Smog so thick that athletes were afraid to train blanketed Beijing and will again when the Olympians leave town.</li>
<li>The Gobi Dessert is about 10 years away from overtaking the city proper.</li>
<li>Pollution is wiping out life from Beijing's lakes, ponds, and rivers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a man claimed to be the smartest man alive, that's a really stupid thing to say, both cognitively and politically.&nbsp; It demonstrates an acute unfamiliarity with business, working, and living conditions in the most populous country on earth.&nbsp; It also demonstrates an almost contemptuous disregard for the sensitivies to the issue among those who've lost jobs to foriegn countries.</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/08/18/the-absolution-candidate/">the messiah </a>would be more comfortable as President of the People's Republic.</p>
