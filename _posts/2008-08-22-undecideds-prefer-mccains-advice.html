<p>I don't know how meaningful this <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,409225,00.html">FoxNews poll</a> is, really.  But it is revealing about America's confidence in the relative judgment of McCain and Obama.  </p>
<p>American's trust McCain more than 3 to 1 over Obama.  </p>
<p>That's big.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you had to make the &ldquo;toughest decision&rdquo; of your life, who would you rather get advice from &mdash; Obama or McCain?</p>
<p>Based on that question, there are signs that undecided voters may be more inclined to move to McCain than to Obama. The largest number of undecideds &ndash; 38 percent &ndash; would rather get advice from McCain &ndash; that&rsquo;s nearly three times as many as the 13 percent that would go to Obama. The remaining say &ldquo;neither&rdquo; (27 percent) or are unsure (18 percent).</p>
<p>Furthermore, independent voters pick McCain by a 15-point margin (41 percent &ndash; 26 percent).</p></blockquote>
<p>Not surprising.  McCain has run a <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/08/21/mccain-might-just-win-this-thing/">masterful campaign </a>and he owns the framing of every issue and of the campaign overall.</p>
