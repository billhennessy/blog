<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/1/31/11112/2465" target="_blank">Daily Kos</a> won't be too happy with the Biden choice.</p>
<p>ABC News's Jake Tapper spent his Saturday morning documenting some of Joe Biden's dumbest moments. <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/08/joe-bidens-mout.html" target="_blank">(It's long.)</a>&nbsp; My favorite came from a Biden 1988 campaign ad in which he seemed to anticipate Obama's candidacy:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The White House isn't the place to learn how to deal with international crisis, the balance of power, war and peace, and the economic future of the next generation," <a href="http://www.4president.us/tv/1988/biden1988bio.htm"><strong><span style="color:#265599;">said a TV ad for Sen. Joe Biden's 1988 presidential campaign</span></strong></a>.&nbsp; "A President has got to know the territory, but that's not enough."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ed Morrissey documented <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/21/obamabiden-for-the-arrogance-ticket/" target="_blank">Biden's list of lies </a>that helped derail his own campaign in 1988.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh on Friday lamented news (of the hour) indicating the Biden would NOT be the choice.&nbsp; I wish Rush were on today--last I heard was Rush offering a prayer that the reports were wrong and Obama would pick Biden.</p>
<p>For my part, I see Biden's selection as evidence that the Dems don't think Obama is man enough to win this thing.&nbsp; They went for stability, but went with a liberal Senator from and eastern state.&nbsp; Not exactly a diverse ticket.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obama was on the path to a rather embarrassing defeat before the announcement of a veep.&nbsp; I see nothing in Biden's selection to alter that momentum.</p>
