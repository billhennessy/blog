<p>Make me puke.</p>
<p>After 10 months of 24 x 7 Obama news, after the Washington Post, <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0808/Rendell_Obama_coverage_was_embarrassing.html">Tom Brokaw, and Ed Rendell</a> admitted that Obama coverage is embarrassingly lavish, after an 8-to-1 newspaper inch advantage over John McCain, these idiot Democrats have the balls to stand there and tell us that Americans just don't know Obama well enough!</p>
<p>The last guy who was so friggin complex that it took a decade to "know him" was Richard Nixon!  Do we really want to go through <em>that</em> again.</p>
<p>Well, maybe if it's a Democrat declaring, "I'm not a crook."</p>
