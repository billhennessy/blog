<p>The University of Illinois releases the Obama-Ayers papers tomorrow.  Don't expect the MSM to mention it--unless it's good news for Obama.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Obama has asked the Department of Justice to block ads that link the Illinois Senator to domestic terrorist William Ayers.  <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12816.html">Pathetic</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the &ldquo;American Issues Project,&rdquo; the vehicle through which Dallas investor Harold Simmons is financing the advertisements. The Obama campaign &mdash; and tens of thousands of supporters &mdash; also is pressuring television networks and affiliates to reject the ads. The effort has met with some success: CNN and Fox News are not airing the attacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>But <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/obama-campaign-launches-desperate-misleading/story.aspx?guid=%7B6DA09B12-7DDB-472F-98B4-2E4EBEA173B8%7D&amp;dist=hppr">MarketWatch</a> reports that a counter-ad by Obama is misleading and fails to address the issues raised in Simmons's ad.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Obama campaign has launched a new ad that fails to dispute a single fact in the American Issues Project's initial ad questioning Barack Obama's relationship with admitted domestic terrorist, William Ayers.</p></blockquote>
<p>We shall see.  I'll report on the Obama-Ayers Papers if the MSM won't.</p>
