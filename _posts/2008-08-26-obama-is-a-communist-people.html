<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/26/gloves-off-now-obama-calls-for-prosecuting-gop-donor/" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a> reports that Barack Obama has asked the US Justice Department to incarcerate a Republican donor in Texas for the high crime of . . . donating money to Republicans.</p>
<p>This guy is as red as Stalin. &nbsp;Don't think for a moment that, if &nbsp;Obama wins, the RNC's donor list will be scrutinized and big donors prosecuted.</p>
<p>Communists don't like competition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop him before he stops you.</p>
