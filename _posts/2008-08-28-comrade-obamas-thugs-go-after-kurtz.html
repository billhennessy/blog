  content: "I am an avid listener or I should say was an avid listener to the talk
    show 96.3 from the Portland ME area (living in North Conway NH)... now the station
    is all sports and has been for about the last 6 months... right after the Stop
    Obama Express campaign began.  What the hell happened?  Who bought out the station,
    who threatened the station, who took it over and stopped the onservative voices
    from being heard.  \n\nLook... I am of sound mind and I am not being dramatic
    when I say there is more than you or I know at work here... the USA is in trouble
    and the Democrats and the far left who say the conservatives and republicans are
    brainwashed and not able to see things as they are better wake up and smell the
    roses before there are not to smell.\n\nMay God's will be done and THAT my friend
    is  what should scare them all!"

<p>Barack Obama's<a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/08/conservative-stanley-kurtz-targeted-by.html" target="_blank"> assault on freedom of speech</a> and of the press continued today as his minions attacke WGN radio in <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/" target="_blank">attempt to squelch journalist Stanley Kurtz</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kurtz is investigating Obama's long and deep ties to terrorist William Ayers. &nbsp;Obama laundered money through a non-profit education foundation into Ayers' numerous corrupt organizations during the 1990s. &nbsp;When news broke of Obama's connection to the convicted terrorist, Obama responded by attempting to incarcerate anyone investigating the connection.</p>
<p>If Obama wins, expect conservative talk show hosts, television commentators, writers, and bloggers to face federal criminal charges. &nbsp;This communist doesn't mess around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If this no good, son-of-a-bitch wins, the 2nd Amendment may be the only way to get our country back.</p>
<p>*UPDATE*<br />
<a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmUwOTllNmMzZDNlMTljMGFmY2JkZTllYmQyOTY0ODY=">National Review Online</a> editors agree that Barack's behavior vis-a-vis the Ayers story portends of the totalitarian regime he plans to bring to America if elected.  </p>
