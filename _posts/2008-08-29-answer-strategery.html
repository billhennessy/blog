<p>Question: &nbsp;Name a quality McCain has in places where Obama doesn't have places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8683" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Brilliant!"]<a href="http://www.johnmccain.com"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8683" title="palin2" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/palin2-300x86.jpg" alt="Brilliant!" width="300" height="86" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Sarah Palin may not be the <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/29/palin-for-america-a-true-conservative/" target="_blank">perfect pick for VP</a>, but she's the most perfect available. &nbsp;By selecting a (hot) working class mother of five with strong conservative principles and a record of putting the people before parties and pricnipalities, John McCain has proven, again, to be the most effective Republican campaigner since Reagan. &nbsp;By choosing Sarah Palin, McCain bolsters support from <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/29/palin-lets-shatter-that-glass-ceiling-that-hillary-cracked/" target="_blank">women</a>, blue collar families and conservatives while hamstringing the Obama campaign.</p>
<p>Obama &nbsp;has already soiled himself by criticizing <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/29/now-obama-wants-experience/" target="_blank">Palin's experience</a>--of which she has approximately 10x Obama. &nbsp; They cannot attack her age, because she's very close in age to Obama. &nbsp;They cannot attack her foreign policy experience because she and Obama are equals on that front. &nbsp;They cannot label her a Washington insider, nor can they use her anti-McCain shots against her; she made none.</p>
<p>That leaves the Democrats with only line of attack: &nbsp;appeal to their base. &nbsp;So they've started attacking on abortion and tax cuts, both of which favor Republicans.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NWIyZDUxOGE5MGQxNWI5ZDhkYmQ2OTU0N2M2ZTI5NzA=" target="_blank">NRO editors </a>put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>By picking Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, John McCain has wowed the public and enthused the Right. He has reinforced some of his winning themes &mdash; that he has the mindset of an outsider and a fighter against corruption. He has also reinforced his appeal as the candidate more in touch with traditional values on moral issues.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/08/21/8558-revision-3/">McCain plays chess</a> while Obama fiddles with checkers. &nbsp;While the messiah sauntered to king's row for his party's crowning, McCain used the clock to position his queen at Obama's jugular. &nbsp;Expect blood to flow when desparate Democrats hire thugs and street gangs to intimidate voters, media, and conservatives in general.</p>
<p>Like Joe Biden, I say, "bring it on."</p>
