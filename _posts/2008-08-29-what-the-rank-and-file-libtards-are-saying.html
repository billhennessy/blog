<p>If I read too much of what the R-and-F Dems are saying about Sarah Palin, I'll be tempted to hunt them down like dogs in the street.  But <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/08/obama-distances.html?cid=128333218#comment-128333218">ABC News has a blog </a>with open comments, and it's worth looking at:</p>
<p><strong>Moron #1</strong>: i just want to know who she's going to hand off her sick child to when shes off and buzzing the middle east? This is a mother's decision???? maybe the eskimo nanny...just a political puppet!<br />

[<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/08/29/democrat-hypocrisy-palins-a-bad-mother/">I told you</a> they were calling her a bad mother for having a career.  I'll bet James Gasowski's little woman is very familiar with the back of his hand.]</p>
<p><strong>Moron #2</strong>:  Extremely interesting how anyone can say this woman has experience, or even more experience than the other three candidates.<br />
She has a bs degree in journalism, and was elected governor less than 2 yrs ago, but she has experience? At what exactly? Other than experience at having children, what else does she have experience doing???<br />
Where is her birth certificate? Alaska? She can't be a US citizen then, right?!<br />
Will she be degraded and belittled like Senator Obama? lol Of course not.<br />
Watch the hypocrisy flow like a muddy river.<br />

[Alaska became a state in 1959.  Palin is 44 years old.  2008-44=1964 > 1959.  bc49's family must be thankful he didn't use his real name.]</p>
<p>And there are more morons where these came from, plus a lot of good conservatives and right-thinking women defending the choice or combating the elitism and sexism and racism demonstrated by the two libtards I quoted.  </p>
