<p>Danielle Bologna's trembles like an injured child's when she approaches the word, "widow."&nbsp; </p>
<p>"I never thought I'd used that word about myself," she recently told an interviewer.</p>
<p>Bologna is a widow.&nbsp; She's also the grieving mother of two sons.&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 22, 2008, a wild, crazed killer wiped out Mrs. Bologna's family as they returned home from a family picnic.&nbsp; Tony, husband and father; Michael, 20 years, sone; Matthew, 16 years, son.&nbsp; Murdered in cold blood for the sport of it.&nbsp; Shot to death in a city with notoriously strict gun laws.&nbsp; A family of four became a family of one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The murderer, Edwin Ramos, is an illegal alien living in San Francisco at the personal invitation and under the protection of <a href="http://astoldbyjen.wordpress.com/2008/07/24/gavin-newsome-quite-possibly-the-most-despicable-politician-ever/">Mayor Gavin Newsome</a>.&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/19/MNK011MAFR.DTL&amp;tsp=1">San Francisco Chronicle</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ramos, a native of El Salvador whom prosecutors say is a member of a violent street gang, was found guilty of two felonies as a juvenile - a gang-related assault on a Muni passenger and the attempted robbery of a pregnant woman - according to authorities familiar with his background.
<p>In neither instance did officials with the city's Juvenile Probation Department alert federal immigration authorities, because it was the city agency's policy not to
<p> consider immigration status when deciding how to deal with an offender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the murders and arrest of Ramos, <a href="http://gavinnewsomsucks.blogspot.com/2008/08/blood-on-newsoms-hands.html">Newsome continues to defend the policy</a>, protecting and inviting more illegal alien murders into the United States and into San Francisco.&nbsp; Newsome never offered an apology to Mrs. Bologna.&nbsp; He refuses to consider complying with federal law.&nbsp; He did not attend the funerals, send flowers, or grieve.&nbsp; Instead, he <a href="http://www.topix.com/forum/living/wedding/TMNB3OGDKGOK2IH9T">partied in Montana</a>.</p>
<p>Gavin Newsome is the <a href="http://capoliticalnews.com/s/spip.php?breve5967">proximate cause of the Bologna murders</a>, just as Charles Manson was the proximate cause of the Tate and LaBianca murders.&nbsp; Only a temporary judicial anomaly spared Manson the electric chair.&nbsp; Nothing but a quick trial should stand between Gavin Newsome and the needle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Gavin Newsome deserves to die, along with every official who supported and complied with Newsome's deadly immigration policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But how whacked are San Francisco and California?&nbsp; Newsome, the modern day Charles Manson, might just be the <a href="http://politics.ohio.com/2008/07/22/510/">state's next governor</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You liberals wanted sanctuary cities.&nbsp; We conservatives told you they would destroy us.&nbsp; We were right, as always.&nbsp; </p>
