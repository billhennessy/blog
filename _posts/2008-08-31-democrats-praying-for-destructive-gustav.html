<p>**UPDATE** Don Fowler, former DNC Chairman, apologizes for praying that Gustav destroys New Orleans.&nbsp; The story is buried deep in the bowels of <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/08/ex-dem-chair-ap.html">ABCNews.com</a>&nbsp;<br></p>
<blockquote><p>"If this offended anybody, I personally apologize," Fowler told ABC News. "It was a mistake, and it was a satirical statement made in jest. And one that I clearly don't believe."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**End Update**</p>
<p>Chris Dodd can barely contain himself.&nbsp; Shaving is almost impossible because he can't subdue his smile long enough to get around his lips.&nbsp; But he struggles through, the old trooper.</p>
<p>Dodd's happiness comes from the Caribbean where Hurricane Gustav threatens to swamp New Orleans.&nbsp; For the Democrats, this the game changer.&nbsp; They have armies of talk show guests ready to blame Katrina and Gustav on John McCain.&nbsp; They are thrilled that the RNC won't get a convention.</p>
<p>While John McCain and Sarah Palin speak of "Country First," Barack Obama nods, and whispers, "right after a hurricane gives me a bounce in the polls."</p>
<p>Michael Moore:&nbsp; "Gustav is proof that there is a God in Heaven."</p>
<p>Don Fowler, former chairman of the DNC and a Democrat Congressman from South Carolina giggle and laugh because of Gustav (via <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/31/while-louisiana-prepares-for-hurricane-gustav-dems-gloat-and-guffaw/">Michelle Malkin</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>The hurricane&rsquo;s going to hit New Orleans about the time they start. [Chuckle] The timing is &mdash; at least it appears now that it&rsquo;ll be there Monday. That just demonstrates that God&rsquo;s on our side. [Laughter] &hellip; Everything&rsquo;s cool. [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBus8ORR78">Link to Video</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Republicans may occasionally be guilty of indifference to problems that don't directly affect them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We all lack appropriate compassion from time to time.&nbsp; But John McCain and Sarah Palin are not praying for death and disaster in order to benefit politically.&nbsp; That's solely the territory of Democrats--evil bastards that they are.</p>
<p>Were this Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson giggling about 9/11 and its Republic vote windfall, the video would open every news program on television and ready.&nbsp; The transcript would be the NY Times front page headline.&nbsp; But it's okay, in America, for Democrats to hope and pray that Louisianans and Mississippians lose income, property, and life so long as it helps Obama.</p>
<p>"Country First."&nbsp; Obama can mouth these words all he wants, but they mean nothing coming from him.&nbsp; His party is cheering against New Orleans just as they cheered against our troops in Iraq.&nbsp; These people hate America and hope to see it punished.&nbsp; These people have a psychological pathology more frightening and dangerous than untreated paranoid schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Delenda Obama est.</p>
