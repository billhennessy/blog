  content: "Yes, it was hot.  My left knee feels like it met a sledge hammer for some
    reason.  I'm getting ready to look at my photos and write my impressions of the
    day.  \n\nHere's a tease:  Sarah Palin is a rock star."

<p>We're getting ready to head out to the McCain Rally in O'Fallon, Missouri.&nbsp; I just checked with the campaign and the rally is still on.&nbsp; John McCain is stopping in New Orleans to check on hurricane preparations before the rally, so I wouldn't be surprised if it starts late.</p>
<p>I'll have photos and a report on the events this evening.</p>
