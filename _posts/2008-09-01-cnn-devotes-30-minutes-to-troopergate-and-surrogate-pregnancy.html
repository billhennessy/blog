<p>Un-fucking-believable.&nbsp; Wolff Blitzer has no shame.&nbsp; His show is devoting the 5:00 p.m. hour to continuing the idiotic rumor that Sarah Palin faked her fifth pregnancy to cover the actual pregnancy of her daughter.</p>
<p>They also spent 10 minutes spinning innuendo over the troopergate fabrication.&nbsp; CNN's justification is that Palin hired a lawyer to handle the investigation.&nbsp; Duh!&nbsp; What was she supposed to do, hire a veterinarian?&nbsp; Her political enemies, of which she has many due to her cleaning-up of the GOP in Alaska, have seized upon a family dispute between Palin's sister and brother-in-law, a State Trooper in Alaska.</p>
<p>Neither story rises to the level legitimate news, but the Democrats are desperate to smear the most dangerous Republican to come along since Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Perhaps CNN and Wolff Blitzed should buy a friggin' newspaper and find real news to talk about.</p>
<p>Shameful.</p>
<p>**UPDATE: &nbsp;Larry King Devotes Show to Bristol Paliln**</p>
<p>The washed up, withered, and wrinkley waste of flesh known to millions as Larry King decide, in his impartiality, to devote tonight's program to discussing a 17-year-old girl's sex life. &nbsp;Nice.</p>
<p>I wish Bristol Palin would go on his show and tell him to shove his phalic microphone up his hemmorhoid-scabbed ass.</p>
