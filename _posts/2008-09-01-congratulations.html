<p>I'll dispense with hyperbole and sarcasm.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate and thank the people who are making Gustav a better experience than Katrina.</p>
<p><strong>The People of the Gulf Coast</strong></p>
<p>You rebuilt, prayed, and left your homes, business, and schools in God's able hands.&nbsp; You were rewarded, or will be, for, not only your wisdom in retreating from nature, but your perseverance and faith.&nbsp; You deserve our help, our thanks, and our support. </p>
<p><strong>Ray Nagin</strong></p>
<p>Mayor Nagin was a laughing stock during and after Katrina.&nbsp; Since then, he's rebuilt a major American city and guided it through another hurricane.&nbsp; Those are tough jobs that small men would not take on, particularly after the treatment we gave him 3 years ago.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jindal</strong></p>
<p>Bobby Jindal was not the governor in 2005.&nbsp; I get the feeling that Katrina would not have been so bad if he had been. He's been a true leader throughout.&nbsp; Congratulations to this outstanding governor.</p>
<p><strong>Homeland Security</strong></p>
<p>I still think we should disband this bureaucracy, but they performed well here.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Army Corps of Engineers</strong></p>
<p>Rivers belong where they can ramble (Stephen Sch</p>

<p>wartz).&nbsp; You guys disagree with that.&nbsp; Somehow, you shored up and improved the levees and stood by them.&nbsp; Good job.</p>
<p><strong>New Orleans First Responders</strong></p>
<p>As always, you put your asses on the line and did the job.&nbsp; Get a big kiss from your S.O.&nbsp; And a raise.</p>
<p><strong>George W. Bush</strong></p>
<p>The man in charge.&nbsp; Everything that went wrong with Katrina was heaped on your shoulders.&nbsp; Everything that went right with Gustav belongs on your resume.&nbsp; Congratulations, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>John McCain</strong></p>
<p>In the Hanoi Hilton, you said, "no" when self-preservation ran up against your country.&nbsp; Today, you put your country before your White House ambition.&nbsp; You deserve great credit for your sacrifices--all of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>America</strong></p>
<p>Still, and always, the shining city on a hill whose best days are always before us.&nbsp; </p>
