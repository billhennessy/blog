<p>Despite promises from Barack Obama that his campaign would drop attacks on its Republican rivals during Hurricane Gustav, that <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/01/biden-skips-labor-day-parade-to-monitor-hurricane/">walking hunk of excrement</a>, Joe Biden, broke the promise and ripped into John McCain today during a stump speech.</p>
<blockquote><p>The only guy in America in a position of some authority who is out of sync with the whole rest of the world is John McCain.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Biden skipped out on a planned appearance at Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh, Pa., saying,&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s totally appropriate that elected officials march here in Pennsylvania, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be a day for national politics,&rdquo;he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd like to punch that s.o.b. in the nose.</p>
