    once you get to your highest level, then you have to be unselfish.  Stay reachable.  Stay

<p>Asked about Bristol Palin's pregnancy, Barack Obama firmly stated that children of candidates are "off limits," and that anyone in his campaign discussing the matter "will be fired."</p>
<p>Outstanding. &nbsp;I watched and heard the interview, and I have no doubt he meant what he said. &nbsp;His vigor was sincere.</p>
<p>As someone who villifies Obama regularly, I owe it to the man when he comes through. &nbsp;This time he did.</p>
<p>I hope his minions listen.</p>
