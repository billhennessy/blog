  content: Actually, Bill, I think people's negative attitudes toward Palin have more
    to do with her advocacy of "abstinence-only" sex education, her possible abuses
    of political power, her immature reaction to radio shock jocks' cruel insults
    of her political rival, her lack of experience dealing with foreign -- or even
    national -- policy, her membership in a group that advocates secession, or ...
    oh, well. There are more, but my fingers grow tired. You get the idea.

  content: You left out the best part of the story.  When Sarah went fishing she hired
    some lobbyists to bait her hook, and she reeled in $27 million in federal subsidies
    for her 6,700 person town!  Quite a haul for a lady who claims she's against government
    pork!

    Do you REALLY think we Independent Voters are this stupid, naive, malleable, gullible and forgetful?

    The whole CANDIDACY of J. McCain and his reckless choice of S. Palin is. like. watching. a. slow. train. wreck.

    But again, it's been that way from the start.

    McCain's candidacy is a joke, mostly on the Republican establishment.

    In November, it will be a landslide for Obama and Biden.

  content: "As an American living abroad, the sheer embarassment of watching Sarah
    Palin run for the second highest office in the US is like watching a buffoon contestant
    devoid of talent seeking a place on American Idol. The response is one of pain,
    astonishment, comedic derision.  The problem is when watching this overseas, I
    feel more like an uncle watching a hapless niece being paughed at on stage; not
    because I like Sarah Palin, but because I care for the US. \n\nIn an ongoing Economist
    international web-based poll, 85% of the world is voting for Obama, praying that
    another George W. Bush will not happen again. The applause meter has been read,
    best to bring out the hook and euthanize this McCain-Palin ticket."

  content: "McCain succumbed to the forced pregnancy lobby, selling himself out by
    choosing Palin. \n\nLikening herself to a female dog, she has now demonstrated
    a willingness to bear false witness (i.e \"pallaing around with terrorists\" -
    give me  a break). She has been found to be ethically cahllenged (\"troopergate\").
    She can barely form an independent thought (Katie Couric.)\n\nSo the president
    of Pakistan thinnks she's hot. SHE IS SIMPLY JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH.\n\nEven if
    she share's your values (which of your value sharing gfriends can be president?,
    it is not enough to qualify her.\n\nShe has nothing positivie to say about her
    own candidacy so she elevates herself by tearing the other guy down. Sick stuff."

    Sorry for the typos in previous post. Ms. Palin has  several priors (the unlawful gil net issue was just one), as do her son, her daughter, her husband and particularly her older brother, Charles Heath, all uncoverable on a particular Alaska web site. Many are traffic related (alcohol problems?.)

    We have all screwed up in life, but we are all not running for the white house.

<p>More bad news about John McCain's selection for Vice President emerged tonight.&nbsp; Sarah Palin was cited for <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/sep/01/mccain-camps-detailed-review-of-palin-1/">fishing without a license</a>.</p>
<p>CNN is sending a team of reporters and producers to Wasilla, Alaska, to cover this emerging scandal.</p>
<p>The citation does not indicate what she was fishing with or for, but the fact that a would-be Vice President of the United States did, with malice aforethought, cast her line into known fishing waters with the intent of extracting--or reasonably expecting to extract--a live fish demonstrates her unfitness for office of any kind.</p>
<p>No wonder the libtard media are so down on Sarah.&nbsp; </p>
