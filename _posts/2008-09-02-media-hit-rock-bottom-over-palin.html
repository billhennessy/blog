<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/02/selective-sympathy-for-moms-in-public-office/">Michelle Malkin</a> calls is "Palin Derangement Syndrome."&nbsp; William F. Buckley called it "liberal mania."&nbsp; I call it "angry cynicism."&nbsp; Call it what you will, the leftist media's treatment of Sarah Palin and her family is an embarrassment to the country and felony indictment of the journalism industry in America.</p>
<p>Only Hurricane Gustav's untimely arrival spared us from 24 hours of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=8751" target="_blank">Bristol Palin's sex life on CNN</a>.&nbsp; Every political/talk host on the network devoted the majority of his show to the subject.&nbsp; Democrat talking heads each lined up to give his or her opinion of what's wrong with the Palin family--a family more sound than any I've ever met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most frightening, hate-inspiring, despicable, and incurably stupid are the women.&nbsp; Better still, the half-women.&nbsp; Half-witted, hair-brained babbling morons like Campbell Brown, Maureen Dowd, and other weak, women display their deep jealousy of Palin with every monosyllabic word they shriek.</p>
<p>Oddly, Dowd and Brown don't really have a problem with Palin; they have a problem with feminism.&nbsp; They lack the tools to achieve <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/" target="_blank">feminism's ultimate prize</a>:&nbsp; excellent career +&nbsp; excellent family + self-fulfillment.&nbsp; In modern times, only Sarah Palin has achieved this triathlon of feminist idealism, and she ain't a feminist.</p>
<p>Dowd and Brown have achieved a certain amount of professional stature at the expense of dissatisfying personal lives.&nbsp; A family of five would have stopped them way down on the journalistic/writing ladder.&nbsp; But free and easy infanticide spared them a life of career mediocrity.&nbsp; "Kill the little bastards," is their motto.</p>
<p>Palin, on the other hand, is closing in on the pinnacle of political achievements while raising five children, one with Down Syndrome.&nbsp; She juggles the impossible and makes it look easy.&nbsp; Dowd merely writes a column and usually looks like she got too close to Hurricane Gustav.&nbsp; Campbell Brown isn't even a household name.</p>
<p>Their jealous mania drives them to denegrade Palin, the uber-woman, and her daughter, Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dowd and Brown openly encourage the young girl to defy her parents and have an abortion.&nbsp; They want another child to die.&nbsp; They ache for the whir of the baby blender.&nbsp; They can taste the blood, and it excites them.</p>
<p><a href="http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/09/02/i-will-not-back-down-from-my-support-for-sarah-palin.php" target="_blank">Millions, though, </a>pray to a more familiar God, the One who spared Abraham's son Isaac.&nbsp; The liberals' god knows no such mercy.&nbsp; In the liberal church, the high sacrament of abortion, the offering of an unborn child to the feminist mysto-god, is a required duty of every woman who hopes to break the glass ceiling.&nbsp; Climbing above it without an abortion challenges their faith.&nbsp; And they guard their faith with dangerous weapons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These images seem so obvious.&nbsp; How tainted and selfish is our society that it cannot see them, too?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps, now that that the media have hit rock bottom, we will leave them as the addict's family abandons him to his needles.&nbsp; Perhaps this will be the great end of the MSM so needed and so overdue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or perhaps Brown and Dowd will win major awards for their efforts to kill a child.</p>
