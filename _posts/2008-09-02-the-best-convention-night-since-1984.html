<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/02/remarks_former_sen_fred_thomps.html">Fred Thompson</a> validated all of my reasons for being a conservative and a Republican.&nbsp; <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/02/remarks_sen_joe_lieberman.html">Joe Lieberman</a> vindicated my decision to support John McCain.&nbsp; The combination of speakers and videos restored in Republicans that swagger we had when Reagan handed over the reins to George H. W. Bush.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After two days of disgraceful, amoral, hate, innuendo, and cynicism from the leftist media in this country, the parade of grown-ups must have struck every viewer as the nation's passage from infancy to a particularly profound adulthood.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While Obama recited Mondale's Great Society II speech from 1984, Thompson recited Obama's "historical" qualifications:</p>
<blockquote><p>To deal with these challenges the Democrats present a history making nominee for president.
<p>History making in that he is the most liberal, most inexperienced nominee to ever run for President. Apparently they believe that he would match up well with the history making, Democrat controlled Congress. History making because it's the least accomplished and most unpopular Congress in our nation's history.
<p>Together, they would take on these urgent challenges with protectionism, higher taxes and an even bigger bureaucracy.
<p>And a Supreme Court that could be lost to liberalism for a generation.
<p>This is not reform.
<p>And it's certainly not change.
<p>It is basically the same old stuff they've been peddling for years. America needs a President who understands the nature of the world we live in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever since the 2004 elections, my Republican pride has been subdued, as anyone who reads this blog regularly knows.&nbsp; It was down because a Republican Congress seemed more interested in staging their follow-on careers than in re-invigorating the Reagan Revolution.&nbsp; It was down because a Republican President seemed more intent on proving that his Secretary of Defense was the smartest man in Washington than he was in winning a goddamn war!&nbsp;
<p>But that's changed, my friends, in a big way.
<p>Selecting Sarah Palin as his running mate confirmed my rising suspicion than John McCain is a visionary political strategist.&nbsp; Seeing the pair in person Sunday I was floored by her stage presence and wow factor.&nbsp; Hearing Fred Thompson's <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/09/02/unbelievable-speech.php">brilliant recommendation</a> of one of America's greatest war heroes, John McCain, and Joe Lieberman's stunning endorsement and plea to Democrats has my spirits almost as high as they were the day after the election in 1994.
<p>Let's go win one for the Gipper.</p>
