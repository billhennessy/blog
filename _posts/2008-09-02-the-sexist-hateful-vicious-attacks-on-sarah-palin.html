  content: What are you saying otbricki? That it is all fair then? But Obama just
    said that families should be left out of it. Which is it? You seem to disagree
    with him. Please tell why he is wrong.

<p>Not my words, there, but those of Susan Estrich, Democrat feminist, speaking on FoxNews.&nbsp; Estrich specifically identified the hateful sexists as "my friends."&nbsp; She thoroughly and unquestionably denounced everything that's come from Washington Post, New York Times, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/02/pds-alert-us-magazines-partisan-hit-job/">US magazine</a>, and <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/leading-democrat-sarah-palins-family.html">Barney Frank</a></p>

<p> in the past 36 hours. </p>
<p>Earlier, Laura Ingraham nailed it, saying, "If this were a liberal, feminist, pro-choice woman candidate whose daughter got pregnant and had an abortion during the campaign, she'd be hailed as a hero."</p>
<p>She knows <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/02/media-hit-rock-bottom-over-palin/">you liberal bastards</a> better than you'll ever know yourselves.&nbsp; </p>
