    This is meaningless drivel.

    You don't have anything to stand on, and this is the best you can do.

    Well, at least now with McCain-Palin's loser ticket, you'll have someone to pick on for the next 8 years.

    Obama &amp; Biden --> on the road to a landslide

  content: I could not have said it better myself. Obama is such a narcisist......he
    is Bill Clinton in black (only half black, but let's not bring that up)I think
    he is like Bill in that if he says something long enough that it becomes his truth.....don't
    let the facts get in the way of a Presidential campaign. I think the previous
    writer is right though.....Obama and Biden are headed for a lindslide, unfortunately,
    they will be under the rocks.

    Independent--(which obviously is an oxymoron for you being a democrat)...I noticed you were unble to refute the post.  All you could do was call names--the mark of intelletual inferiorty.  What a waste of time to even read a comment that didn't have a point--except to prove to us that you are in complete lock-step with the MSM--they are sputtering also...I smell(see) fear from you, and victory for McCain/Palin...

    We are laughing, and the Empty Suit is collapsing...

  content: Barak Obama is an actor (and not a very good one, since he always relies
    on a Teleprompter).  Give him lines to speak, and he can convince many people
    that he knows what he is talking about.  His cult followers ask nothing of him,
    other than &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and &ldquo;change&rdquo;, and this is all he can
    offer them.  They are too gullible to see that he is a complete phony.  However,
    those of us who have interviewed persons have the skills to separate the real
    players from the pretenders.  Barak Obama is a total pretender.  God help us if
    this inexperienced actor gets anywhere near the White House.

    Here's a harbinger of things to come. My freind's wife, who is a die hard liberal and defended Clinton to the end thru all his digressions, has said she would be voting republican this year. I would have bet my house she would never have considered voting for any republican. Palin has changed the whole complexion of this campaign...and it has'tn hurt that Hussain Obama keeps shooting himself in the foot with the dumbass things he says. And picking Biden as a running mate has to be the stupidist move a presidential candidate has ever done! Just wait now for story of Public A llies to break!
    The Obama's are MARXIST!!!!!!

  content: Independent voters of the USA calls 52% of the vote a landslide? With ALL
    the help this clown got from the liberal media (even some in the liberal media
    admit this) he should have won by at least an 80% margin. He is a lying, Marxist,
    little narcissist and an overwhelming embarrassment to MY country.

  content: Well it's two years later and it's obvious Bill hennessy was right. Thre
    can no longer be any doubt, Obama , leader of the most incompetent administration
    in American history, is a marxist shithead.

  content: The two happiest people in the world that Comrade Chairman Osama bin Bite-me
    is slithering around in the White House are Obama bin Laden because Comrade Chairman
    Osama bin Bite-me seems to be on his side and Jimmy Carter because Carter has
    been elevated from being the worst president in American history to being the
    second worst.

<p>Is anyone dumber than Barack Obama?</p>
<p>I've interviewed a lot of job candidates, usually for positions as computer programmers, network engineers, and project manager.&nbsp; I've heard a lot of bullshit in these interviews.&nbsp; I usually let these poor, desperate folks make their case.&nbsp; I shake their hands, escort them out, thank them for considering my company, call them about 2 hours later, and tell them, "I'm selecting another candidate for the position, and I wish you all the best in your pursuit."</p>
<p>If anyone ever told me, "I think I'm qualified to be a computer programmer because I did a really good job writing the resume of a computer programmer," I'd end the meeting right then and there, tell the person I'm not interested in resume writers, and have someone else take him out the building.</p>
<p>Today, Barack Obama said he's <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/02/obama-defends-his-superior-record-of-experience/">qualified to be president</a> because he wrote up a <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/02/obamas-answer-on-experience-but-im-such-a-great-campaigner/">very presidential resume</a>.&nbsp; Un-fucking-believable. </p>
<p>Barack's line of reason might work in academia--that toilet where truth, reality, and accomplishment go to get flushed into the sea of self-importance.&nbsp; It might work with grandmothers.&nbsp; It won't work with thinking people in America.</p>
<p>Barack Obama is a shithead.&nbsp; No two ways about it.&nbsp; He's a child and a liar and a egomaniac on a scale that makes Bill Clinton look like Mother Teresa. </p>
