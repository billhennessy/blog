    Do you really want to encourage teenage girls to get pregnant and be forced to get married because of it?
    doesn't seem like that much of a positive message to be sending. Guess it's better then admitting we all want to have a corporate lobby supporting us.... mmm, oil money, mmmmm

  content: "No, Thomas Paine, and I have the balls to use my real name.  \n\nFirst,
    who's forcing whom to get married?  Does Bristol Palin look under duress?  Does
    Levi Johnson? I don't think so.  They have no idea what they've gotten themselves
    into, but no one's forcing them to get married.\n\nSecond, does any of the 1,938
    posts on this blog remotely encourage teenage pregnancy, you dweeb?  Why don't
    READ once in a while.  A book without pictures.\n\nThird, since you hate corporations
    so much, where do you work?  Which corporation puts food on your table?  If you're
    so nobly anti-corporation, why do you have \"Ads by Google\" on your site?   Have
    you checked Google's market cap lately?  They might be lefties, but they're sure
    as hell not commies.\n\nCommon sense tells rational humans that John McCain and
    Sarah Palin offer something closer to your libertarian ideal than do Barack Obama
    and Joe Biden.  But you are too immature to deal with politics.  So you hide behind
    some impossible ideology pretending 1 degree=1000 degrees.  Well, you're wrong.
    And you're as far from common sense as Obama is from patriotic."

    Why dont you read and comprehend you dweeb!
    I didnt say i hate corporations, I said you need a corporate lobby to be in the position Sarah Palin is in today. You know, that oil industry that has created her career in Alaska.
    That Tshirt sure does look like you are encouraging young girls to have babies... You cant be sarah palin unless your daughter has a baby before she graduates High School. I know you didnt make it, but Malkin already has a corporation behind her work, so that understandable, you just think its a good idea.

  content: "In a way this is a perfect anecdote of what's been happening. TP and the
    rest of the Obotdom simply don't get it. They have absolutely no clue what this
    t-shirt actually means... It's amazing that so many seemingly intelligent and
    verifiably well educated individuals could be so impressively obtuse. \n\nThey.
    Just. Don't. Get. It."
