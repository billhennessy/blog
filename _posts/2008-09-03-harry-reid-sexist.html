  content: It will absolutely backfire. "Shrill" is what Hillary was routinely called
    when she dared to criticize Obama, and all that did is split the Democratic Party.
    I am amazed that Reid is stupid enough to use the one word that will likely drive
    many disaffected Democrats toward McCain.

<p><strong>Ponder this: &nbsp;The Republicans may win this election because we believe a woman can have both a career and a family, and the Democrats believe she cannot. &nbsp;Never would have dreamed it possible.</strong></p>
<p>Harry Reid's office sent a press release describing Sarah Palin's speech as "shrill" in response to Palin's shot at Reid's declaration of surrender. &nbsp;What a wuss.</p>
<p>The liberal women on CNN are PISSED at Reid. &nbsp;They take it as a shot at women. &nbsp;"Shrill" is a code word. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blitzed One tried to claim Reid was referring to Giuliani, but the source confirmed Reid was describing Palin.</p>
<p>"This will backfire," says CAMPBELL BROWN.</p>
<p>Now there's an all out battle between the feminists (Campbell Brown and other female CNN folk) and Paul Begala/Donna Brazil. &nbsp;Check it out.</p>
<p>These women are furious. &nbsp;Furious at the surrender monkey.</p>
