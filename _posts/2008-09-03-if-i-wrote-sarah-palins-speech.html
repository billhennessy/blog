  content: Great article if it wasn't full of flat out lies.  Typical.  How about
    an article by Sarah Palin titled, "If I actually wrote my own speech this is what
    I would say"  Then we might find out who she is.

  content: Steve, did you have a point, or did you just decide you needed to embarrass
    yourself.  Now go change your bong water like a good boy.

    I have been asking everyone I know why no one is talking about the things you mention.  No one will even go there.

    Where are the straight talkers???  Americans speak up!

    It is not dirty politics to discuss the truth!

<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<blockquote><p>They say I lack experience.&nbsp; They're right, in a way.</p>
<p>I have no experience wandering a city for three years trying to find myself.&nbsp; No, I've never had that luxury.&nbsp; But Barack Obama has.</p>
<p>And I have no experience funneling money from an educational trust into organizations run by my close friend, the convicted terrorist.&nbsp; No experience at all.</p>
<p>Nor do I have the experience of having a political career launched by a pair of terrorists who tried to blow up the Capitol and the Pentagon, who succeeded in killing a police officer.&nbsp; But Barack Obama has.</p>
<p>And I don't have any experience legalizing the murder of children who survive abortion.&nbsp; Barack Obama does, though.</p>
<p>I haven't had the experience of moving into a million dollar mansion bought with the help of a convicted slum-lord felon.&nbsp; You'll have to ask Barack what that's like, 'cause I don't know.</p>
<p>While Barack was gaining all that experience, I was too busy.&nbsp; I was busy raising a family of five, running a PTA, running a city, and running the largest state in the country.&nbsp; While Barack was perfecting his resume, I was fighting corruption and packing lunches for the kids to take to school.</p>
<p>While Barack was working on an image for the media and a phony presidential seal, I was negotiating with oil companies and returning some of their abusive profits to the people of Alaska.</p>
<p>Now, people tell me that it's impolite -- imPOLitic -- to bring up Barack's sordid friends and unscrupulous practices.&nbsp; We don't talk about these things at conventions.</p>
<p>But the other side, through their media outlets, changed those rules.&nbsp; While the other side still believes Barack's corruption off limits, they have no problem tittering and giggling about&nbsp; a 17 year old girl in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>While they think it improper to talk about Tony Rezko, they think it cute and funny and effective ti blame a woman for her child's illness.</p>
<p>While think it's a woman's duty to put away an inconvenient baby, they don't want a mother telling her children not to have sex before marriage.</p>
<p>While they believe in license, they have no time for consequences.</p>
<p>So you want to talk experience, Barack?&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Make my day.</p>
<p>John McCain has the experience of a lifetime of devotion to his country.&nbsp; John McCain experienced five years of living hell in a Vietnamese prison camp with broken arms, broken legs, broken ribs, broken teeth, diarrhea, infection, bug sandwiches, boils, and boiling heat.</p>
<p>John McCain has the experience of saying "no" to get out of jail cards because the price was too high:&nbsp; the price was honor.</p>
<p>John McCain has the experience of leading men in battle and through prison, teaching them courage, honor, duty, and country.</p>
<p>John McCain has the experience of living the resume of a great president and leader, not of simply writing one.</p>
<p>John McCain's experience couldn't fit on Barack Obama's teleprompter.</p>
<p>And on November 4, John McCain and I will have the experience of sending Barack Obama back to rouse the rabble in the streets of South Chicago where he belongs.</p></blockquote>
