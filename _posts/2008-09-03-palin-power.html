  content: "In my view, the main reason she poses a lethal threat to the Obama candidacy
    is that she is who Obama claims to be. Palin is the genuine article, whereas Obama
    is only a packaged facsimile thereof. And the longer we look at the two, the more
    obvious it becomes. \n\nBecause when Obama encountered a corrupt political system,
    his first and only instinct was to worm his way into it and profit from it. Palin's
    was to reform it. Obama has never effected any change, not even in that idiotic
    little church of his where he meekly sat for 20 years. Palin, on the other hand,
    has a genuine record. Her speech was absolutely perfect. In my view, the most
    devastating line was the one which drew attention to the simple fact that while
    Obama has written two autobiographies, he has not written any laws, law journal
    articles, nothing. While I know plenty about Obama's record (for lack of a better
    term, since he actually doesn't have one), I found the juxtaposition of these
    two facts really striking. It is, I think, the perfect way to summarize who Obama
    is and stands for."

<p>Sarah Palin's Vice Presidential acceptance speech was a grand slam, walk-off homerun to the opposite field that knocked a beer out of Obama's hand after the concession stand closed.</p>
<p>She was smooth, easy, natural, funny, smart, real, genuine, organic, and brilliant.</p>
<p>My favorite line: &nbsp;" . . . after the fake, styrofoam Greek columns have been hauled back to the lot in Hollywood . . ."</p>
<p>Chris Wallace, "A star is born. &nbsp;That's single, most compelling argument I've heard from the Republicans this election cycle."</p>
<p>Karl Rove says she might have addressed the media-family frenzy more directly, but I disagree. &nbsp;Despite my pseudo-speech last night, she did the right thing by remaining above the degenerates at NYT, WaPo, and CNN.</p>
<p>Obama's campaign limply claims Palin's speech sounded like a Bush speech. &nbsp;They really don't know what to do about Palin. &nbsp;She's both less and more than the Democrat murder machine can hit.</p>
<p>BTW, besides Barack Obama, the other big loser tonight might have been Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. He had been fingered as the next Reagan. &nbsp;After Palin's speech, I think Palin takes that crown. &nbsp;Former Clinton communications director just gave the speech accolades: &nbsp;"She put that knife in Obama's back, and she did with a smile. &nbsp;In terms of her ability to make a case against Barack Obama and do it with a smile, she is very, very good."</p>

<blockquote><p>Several moderate-Democrat friends of mine have been emailing--few if any would ever vote for McCain--but all agree that Palin was very strong. The more liberal among them are a little panicked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I completely misjudged how negative she would be. Her lines about Obama were brutally cutting and possibly over the top in places.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Krauthammer: &nbsp;"She used her small town background to show up Obama as an elitist out of touch."</p>

<blockquote><p>Something rather astounding is happening in this campaign. Sarah Palin may single-handedly be giving John McCain another chance at a victory which seemed a distant hope after Obama's night at Invesco (which now feels like a month ago).</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CNN Post-Speech Coverage: &nbsp;Five of 6 commentators are liberals, and it's unanimous--<strong>one of the most effective political speeches in modern times.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Wow.</p>
