    Is it noble to divorce your wife because she was in a car crash?
    Is it heroic to try and bend the rules to get some local supporters to get more cash?
    Is it remarkable to support a president, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtaaNWvtcVc, and then claim he has destroyed your party?


    ps
    Ayers wasn't convicted, Rev Wright was a Marine, and Rezko wasn't convicted when he had dealings with Obama... I know, i know, pesky details, but they are sort of important distinctions.

<p>We've all heard John McCain's horrible experience in Vietnam.&nbsp; I've never before heard him tell it.</p>
<p>What strikes me is the enormous contrast between him and Barack Obama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John McCain has lived a noble, heroic, remarkable life.&nbsp; Barack Obama's read about such things.</p>
<p>John McCain left it all on the battle field, then in a POW camp, then in hospitals where he gave his all for his country.&nbsp; Barack Obama took everything he could get his hands on:&nbsp; money from a convicted slum-lord felon, street cred from bigotted America-hating minister, political favor from a convicted anti-American terrorist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John McCain thanks God for his meager skills as an orator.&nbsp; Barack Obama regrets he isn't even better than he is.</p>
<p>John McCain is a man.&nbsp; Barack Obama is a boy.</p>
