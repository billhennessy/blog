<p>Sarah Palin will push <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/?map=1&amp;save=3-3-3-3-1-4-1-1-1-4-4-1-3-1-4-2-3-3-3-1-1-1-4-2-3-4-4-3-4-3-1-4-1-4-4-4-3-2-2-1-3-3-3-3-3-1-4-1-3-2-3" target="_blank">9 toss-up states</a> into McCain's camp (from left to right):</p>
<ul>
<li>Nevada</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>New Mexico</li>
<li><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13198.html">Michigan</a></li>
<li>New Hampshire</li>
<li>Indiana&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ohio</li>
<li>Virginia</li>
<li><a href="http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReportEmail.aspx?g=e3a24829-6f3f-4928-b30f-cb21804091f0" target="_blank">Florida</a></li>
</ul>
<div>This will give McCain the Electoral College victory in November, 300 to 238.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Palin-Effect works two different ways: &nbsp;Rough Rider Admiration and Strong Woman Identification. &nbsp;This estimate and projection is based on analysis of detailed polling data from Gallup and Reuters. &nbsp;The terms Rough Rider Admiration and Strong Woman Identification are my own.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Rough Rider Admiration</strong></div>
<div>In Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan, Indiana, and Florida, men and women who admire rugged individualissts, the outdoors, sports, and that Ronald Reagan stump-clearing ideal will trend to Palin. &nbsp;This trend will be driven by admiration more than identification. &nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Strong Woman Identification</strong></div>
<div>In New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia, identification with a strong woman will be more prevelant than the Rough Rider effect. &nbsp;This move will take longer to emerge. &nbsp;Visible migration in the polls won't occur until after the Vice Presidential debate in St. Louis on October 2.</div>
<div><strong>Risks</strong></div>
<div>The risks to these theories are, in order of likelihood:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Obama can neutralize the Strong Woman Identification effect by dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton.</li>
<li>McCain could subdue both effects by hiding Palin or limiting her exposure</li>
<li>A poor debate performance by Palin could neutralize her Strong Woman Identification</li>
</ul>
<div>Since Thursday, several prominent Democrats have indicated that Obama may be considering dropping Biden from the ticket and adding Hillary Clinton as his vice presidential running mate. &nbsp;Biden is a very weak VP candidate who damages Obama's campaign with idiotic speech almost every day of the week. &nbsp;If offered the deal, Hillary might well declining fearing the move would doom Obama's campaign. &nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>Already Obama has abandoned his "campaign in every state" promise to concentrate on several key <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/08/22/obama-stops-advertising-in-red-battleground-states/" target="_blank">battleground states</a>: &nbsp;Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and Colorado. &nbsp;That's admission that Sarah Palin has striken panic in the hearts of his campaign team. &nbsp;</div>
