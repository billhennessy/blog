<p>Senator and VP candidate Joe Biden today broke from the DNC and from Barack Obama declaring his belief that life begins at conception, according to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/us/politics/08campaign.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights.&#160; If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.</p>
<p>Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the interview Sunday, Mr. Biden tried to walk the line between the staunch abortion-rights advocates in his party and his own religious beliefs. While he said he did not often talk about his faith, he said of those who disagree with him: &#8220;They believe in their faith and they believe in human life, and they have differing views as to when life &#8212; I&#8217;m prepared as a matter of faith to accept that life begins at the moment of conception.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biden's revelation could make abortion a major topic in the campaign. Clearly, his moral views are in line with those of McCain and Palin and miles apart from Obama's belief that even a child who survives a botched abortion should be killed on the spot.&#160; </p>
<p>At least this issue isn't above Biden's pay grade.&#160; </p>
<p>This could be the last straw. Pro-abortion zealots will demand <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/06/the-post-palin-electoral-college-map/">Obama drop Biden</a> from the ticket.&#160; Combined with the polls, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/07/holy-hockey-mom-mccain-double-digits-with-likely-voters/">Obama might listen</a>.</p>
<p>This story will grow legs.</p>
