<p>Two polls--<a href="http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1548">Zogby</a> and <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/07/gallup-daily-poll-gives-mccain-largest-margin-since-ma-over-obama/">Gallup</a>--now have John McCain and Sarah Palin leading Barack Obama and Joe Biden by 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively.&#160; Both leads are beyond the margins of error.&#160; </p>
<p>Clearly, the voters like what they see in McCain and, especially, Palin.&#160; These results also validate the idea that Democrat lies and smears aimed at Palin are actually helping&#160; the GOP ticket.</p>
<p>As a result of these numbers, Barack Obama has abandoned the traditional, academic definition of recession, and breaking another promise to his far left supporters:&#160; he will extend the Bush tax cuts in order to help the economy.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right.&#160; Obama is now a <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/07/obama-recession-could-delay-end-to-bush-tax-cuts/">supply sider</a>.&#160; He has acknowledged that tax cuts spur economic growth, and that tax increases on top earner could plunge the economy into a depression.</p>
<p>On InTrade, McCain continues to close in on Obama:</p>

<p>The confused young man, though, indicated he still plans to create an economic depression:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if we&#8217;re still in a recession, I&#8217;m going to go through with my tax cuts,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;That&#8217;s my priority.&#160; </p>
