<p>Today the <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/gameTrax?gameId=20080907021">St. Louis Rams</a> played the worst game in the history of the oft-horrible history, losing 38-3 to a mediocre Philadelphia Eagles team.</p>
<p>Watching the game on a big, HD television made the spectacle ever more frightening.&nbsp; The incompetence, laziness, lack of preparedness, inept game planning and powder-puff tackling seemed to delight head coach Scott Linehan, who believes winning is over-rated.</p>
<p>Linehan's remarkable leadership and motivation worked magic on new offensive coordinator Al Saunders.&nbsp; Once the cream of the crop of up-and-coming offensive geniuses, Saunders burned his wildly successful playbook crafted with the Vermeil and Mike Martz Rams and KC Chiefs.&nbsp; Instead, Saunders changed the face of football offensive strategy by running plays designed to lose yardage.</p>
<p>Lacking talent, the Rams excelled at Saunders's offense.&nbsp; Quarterback Marc Bulger is a master of negative yardage and missed opportunities, and he implemented Saunders's "Net Negative" offensive strategy to a&nbsp; "T."</p>
<p>The Rams defense employed a remarkable of strategy against Eagles' QB Donovan McNabb.&nbsp; The strategy involved giving Eagles receivers 20-30 yard cushions while allowing Donovan unlimited time to set up and throw the ball.&nbsp; This strategy ensured the Rams d-backs had plenty of energy for the post-game parties.&nbsp; McNabb appreciated the Rams' gentle defense, completing 21 of 33 passes for 361 yards and 3 TDs.</p>
<p>Next week, the Rams hope to lose by at least 60 points to defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants.</p>
<p>"I think losing by 50 or 60 points to a team like the Giants would be a feather in our cap," said Linehan during the team's post-game celebration.</p>
<p>Rams tickets are available throughout the St. Louis area at prices ranging from $5 to $15 for all 8 home games.</p>
