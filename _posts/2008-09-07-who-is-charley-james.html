  content: "Since you've such an interest in me, I'll be happy to answer your questions.\n\nFirst,
    a clarification: I did not claim or imply that three people assaulted me nor that
    any of the three \"kicked my ass.\" I wrote that three people approached me, one
    of whom tried to hit me and struck a ligh, glancing blow. I wasn't hurt so I didn't
    file a police report because the man who tried to hit me was grabbed by his friends
    and they all ran off. If you're going to refer to something I've written, please
    get your facts straight.\n\nSecond, Charley James is one of three names under
    which I write. It is not my real name.\n\nAs for your specific questions:\n\n1.
    Please provide at least one form of proof that you were employed as an Assistant
    Editor by Business Week or its parent company, McGraw-Hill. \n\nLew Young was
    editor in chief at the time, Jack Dierdorff was managing editor and the editor
    to whom I reported was Keith Felcyn.\n\n2. Please indicate your employment status
    in Canada:  resident alien, work visa, citizen, etc.\n\nI have immigration special
    status under a NAFTA exemption.\n\n3. What year did you leave the United States.\n\n1991\n\n4.
    Have you ever renounced your US citizenship?\n\nNo\n\n5. Have you ever been convicted
    of a crime in the United States?\n\nOnly for driving 75 mph in a 55 mph zone when
    I was 18 or 19.\n\n4. What is the highest level of education you have achieved?\n\nI
    have attended graduate school.\n\n5. From which colleges/universities do you hold
    degrees?\n\nI attended a Big 10 university for 3 1/2 years but left to accept
    a reporting job before graduating.\n\n6. Please provide official transcripts from
    the school granting degrees. \n\nThis is a joke, right? My first employer didn't
    ask for a transcript.\n\n7. Please state why you left the United States.\n\nI
    was recruited for a position at a time when I wanted the experience of living
    and working in another country.\n\nI hope this answers your questions.\n\nCharley"

    Only a true patriot is be willing to love his country yet admit that he sees its shortcomings and then does what he can to fix what is wrong.

  content: "Charley James, to answer your question, is a top notch journalist and
    editor. I've enjoyed my association with him and have been pleased to carry his
    well-researched articles on our e-newsmagazine here in the UK. I have spoken with
    a few of his sources and would not carry the article unless otherwise satisfied.\n\nI'm
    also an American living abroad. The State Department says there are 2 million
    of us in 200 countries and we are following this election very closely as is every
    nation around the world. \n\nWe live abroad by choice, vote in every election
    and pay our taxes. Our blood is every bit as Red, White and Blue as yours and
    we don't hide behind any flag, catchy slogan, snarky red meat for the base or
    cheap shots. \n\nWe've watched the Democratic candidate go through 19-months of
    hell in his vetting process and now the hockey Mom gets a free pass? Now, Rick
    Davis will only let Gov. Palin into interviews that benefit the campaign while
    Obama sits through Bill O's hostile grilling over four nights? \n\nGive me a break!
    \n\nCharlie 'softball' Gibson gets the first interview and its spread over a few
    days so the campaign can intimidate him or cut it off if they don't like a question?
    What next, he loses his plush leather seat on the Straight Talk xpress plane?
    And Joe Biden sits and takes a grilling 'live' from Tom Brokaw? \n\nIs this candidate
    of yours for real? She's a Vegas act with the one-liners but won't answer questions
    about real issues about conflicts of interest in Alaska?\n\nBut then that is the
    Conservative way. Screw the issues, attack the writer. I'm glad I'd never pass
    your questions test of Charley nor would I even reply. \n\nYou folks amaze, just
    simply never, ever acknowledge or accept the premise of any question and because
    it's worked in the past, obfuscate, bloviate and attack, attack, attack. Divert
    everyone away from the fact that you did nothing for 8-years but ruin the economy,
    place us in a war that never ends and divided the country. The louder you shout,
    the more obnoxious you become and the more your base loves it. Nice work.\n\nThis
    time though the Dems remembered to bring a gun instead of a knife to this fight.
    They'll win the policy war and you'll win the swiftboat misinformation war. \n\nThis
    time let's all pray that America wakes up and sees underneath all of the slime
    that your Emperor and Empress wear no clothes.\n\nCheers."

    4. What is the highest level of education you have achieved?
    I have attended graduate school.

    5. From which colleges/universities do you hold degrees?
    I attended a Big 10 university for 3 1/2 years but left to accept a reporting job before graduating.

    Wait a minute. If the answer to Question 5 is true, how can the answer to Question 4 be true? If he did not graduate from college (3 1/2 years attendance), how did he get into grad school?

  content: "Unfortunately, I think this election has brought out the worst in everybody.
    There is opportunism, self-aborption, and emotional fervor like we have never
    seen before. Don't get me wrong but I have a hard time believing most politicians
    and journalists. \n\nFor the first time in American history, no matter which party
    wins the election, history will be made. Either a black man or a woman will be
    in one of the two most visible positions in American politics.This is a true political
    checkmate. Every possible political power play in the presidential election was
    killed on September 4th 2008. \n\n \nThis checkmmate has spawned whiserings and
    enuendo from both sides of the isle. Barack Obama spoke out against a rumor that
    Sarah Palin's fifth child was actually her grandchild. I listened to an audio
    clip of a radio personality announcing the tidbit of information as if he had
    just discovered that Queen Elizabeth is a lesbian!! What about the male journalists
    who have taken shots at her for not staying home with her children?  What about
    Barack Obama saying that he is alive because of the march on Selma AL? Hello,
    he was born 4 years prior to the march taking place. Take everything you hear
    with a grain of salt and everything you read with a larger grain of salt.\n \nPolitics
    and journalism are not for the weak and faint hearted; people will tell lies just
    to get rumors started to see if they can topple their opponents. Another thing
    to remember is that we are dealing with human beings. All human beings are hungry
    for personal validation and power, you know that 15 minutes of fame. \n \nI could
    take time to enumerate lots of errors of politicans over the years. One of my
    uncles was a senator for two terms and you cannot imagine some of the lies told
    about him. So I place just a little more confidence in broadcast journalism because
    of the vast audience with the opportunity for instant feedback than I do in written
    journalism. And that very little confidence in written journalism, even with citations
    and quotes, is due to the lag in the time it takes to check sources. We should
    all be careful.\n \nLet's just say that we are living in a watershed moment that
    the majority of Americans alive today may not have every imagined and we will
    hear and read some pretty nasty things that may not be entirely accurate. So be
    patient and let's see who wins come November 5."

    A. Anton,

    Graduate school has one meaning: one has entered a University/College as a Graduate taking Graduate courses to obtain a Graduate degree. J. Stevens is correct. If "Charley James" never graduated from his Big 10, then how did he get into Graduate school? Did he attend the Big 10 as a Graduate? If so, then question 5 was left unanswered. He must have at least one degree to list for question 5. Should he not? Also, which Big 10 did he attend?

    Redheadga,

    You are so right. Things must be taken with a grain of salt, especially in these elections. People are painting "good vs. evil" in this race to the Oval Office and things have just begun.

    "openly racist is only the tip of the Palin iceberg. she is also vindictive and mean.

    No wonder the vast sea of white, cheering faces at the Republican Convention went wild for Sarah: They adore the type, it's in their genetic code."

    Who's being racist here?

    "She's a bigot, a racist, and a liar," is the more blunt assessment of Arnold Gerstheimer "These stories about what she calls blacks and Eskimos, well, anyone not white and good looking actually. Why do I know they're true? Because everyone who isn't aboriginal or Indian in Alaska talks that way."

    And here he quotes someone's racist remarks as a way to prove that Palin is racist?

    Sorry, but those lines made it really hard to take this article seriously

    If only a small part of James' story is true, it
    is freightening to think someone like Palin could rise this far.
    We can second guess the Internet all day. The debates, hopefully, will tell us what we need to know.
    But let's face it (and here I reveal MY bias):
    the woman ran for a beauty queen title!  My god,
    what more do you need to know about her brain?

    students attend my graduate classes.  They attended on a non-credit basis and
    normally enrolled through Continuing Education.  Most large universities have
    a school or department of Continuing Education (or a similar name), which provides
    non-credit access to both graduate and undergraduate courses.

He has earned his 15 minutes of fame by giving himself a Peyote enema and making up a ridiculous story about Sarah Palin complete with a fictitious waitress named "Lucille," a name he probably pulled from Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."&#160; (I don't have the book in front of me, but I believe that Lucille was the name of the maid that Duke's attorney attacked in the hotel room when the attorney mistook the maid's mop for an axe handle.)</p>
<p>Now it's our turn to find out about Charley James.</p>
<p>On Helium an other sites, James claims to be a former BusinessWeek assistant editor.&#160; I doubt it.&#160; James's writing is weak, full of filler words, incorrect punctuation, and factual errors.&#160; (For instance, <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/985119-what-qualities-define-a-leader">this article</a>, which we submitted as evidence of his skills, claims Bill Gates invented Windows in his garage.&#160; Gates, et al, may have productized DOS in a garage, but Microsoft was well established by the time Windows came along.)</p>
<p>His writing overflows with mindless sentences like these:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s actually a simple answer: Stop what you&#8217;re probably doing.</p>
<p>Selling more to current customers gets so much attention because it is important.</p>
<p>To much selling involves too many sales people doing a lot of talking but not very much listening. Too often, what happens is that three or four people take turns approaching a customer or client, sometimes with a dizzying parade of PowerPoint slides flashing behind them, as each says how they can meet a customer&#8217;s needs, solve a problem, or help them grab an opportunity. Most of these extravaganza&#8217;s &#8211; which probably took hours to prepare &#8211; are too long, detailed or boring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This writing doesn't earn a 'C' in a high school composition class.&#160; I simply don't believe BusinessWeek hires such weak editors.</p>
<p>Here's what we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Charley James" may not be he real name </li>
<li>James claims to be a former Assistant Editor at Business Week magazine.&#160; I have requested confirmation/denial of Business Week</li>
<li>There are 33 people in Toronto named "C James" or some derivation thereof </li>
<li>James claims in his blog to live near enough to "the Lake" to walk his dog there regularly </li>
<li>Only one C James lives very near Lake Ontario, at [address withheld] Toronto, ON, M1E 2B4 </li>
<li>James claims on his blog to have been physically assaulted and battered by 3 Americans who crossed the border for the sole purpose of finding him and kicking his ass in broad daylight.&#160; (I doubt this story is true, but these three deserve a medal if it is.)&#160;&#160; There would be a police report, but I find none</li>
<li>James claims to have worked in multiple newsrooms in the US and Canada, so someone must have worked with him </li>
<li>James claims to have been born in Milwaukee, WI, and, judging from his photo (assuming it's recent), that birth would have taken place between about 1945 and 1960 </li>
<li>James claims to be a baseball fan </li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next week, I will find out just who this guy is.&#160; What schools did he attend?&#160; Did he work for BusinessWeek and was he an "Assistant Editor."&#160;&#160; I've sent inquiries to BusinessWeek and to James himself.&#160; </p>
<p>**UPDATE**&#160; An e-mailer points out something I missed:&#160; Does Charley James have visible links to Barack Obama or his campaign?&#160; </p>
