    Later, it turned out that McCain himself used the phrase more than once, including last year, when he was talking about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's 1990s health care plan.

    He said last October, "I think they put some lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig."

    Speaking about opponents of President Bush's Iraq strategy last year, McCain criticized their reasoning.

    "It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don't," McCain said. "You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig, in my view."

    And the phrase is a common one, so much so that Torie Clarke, the former Pentagon communications director in the Bush administration -- a Republican and a woman -- named her book "Lipstick on a Pig: Winning in a No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game."

    Find something else to cry about.

    First of all, it's not DEFEAT until the votes have been counted and McCain has been declared the president. Second of all, it's a popular phrase, used several times by McCain himself, once directed at Clinton. I suppose I can be as petty as you and say he called her a pig.

    You know, it's meaningless garbage like this that attempts to distract voters from the things that are REALLY important. Don't know what that is? I'll give you a hint: It ain't bacon.

    Bill,

    Clearly you have a difficult time reading.

    If you look at the context of Obama's comments, he is also referring to an "inanimate thing".

    "John McCain says he's about change, too," Obama said, leading into a string of ways he contends McCain represents more of the same -- economic policy, taxes, education, foreign policy, campaign tactics. "That's not change. That's just calling something that's the same thing something different.  You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig.  You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper and call it change. It's still going to stink, after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing."


    I guess in your mind, Obama not only called Palin a "pig", but also an "old fish".

    People like you are brainwashers...however, you are an amateur.

    clear that Obama's comments were ironic substitutions:  old fish = McCain; pig

    Oh...if by Biden's comments in Columbia, MO, you are referring to when he said:

    "I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy ... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability, who were born with a birth defect.  Well, guess what, folks? If you care about it, why don't you support stem cell research?"


    What is the problem with that?  How is that demeaning or insulting?  Disregarding whether or not one believes in stem cell research, the comment is not inappropriate in the least!

    Is it the fact that he mentioned (rather implied) Palin's special needs son?  As I see it, that is fair game.

    I seem to recall Palin making quite a big deal about her son and her situation when she gave her little speech at the Brainwash National Convention.

    If she talks about it on national TV...it's fair game.

    (Had Biden brought up parents with pregnant teens, then that's a different story.)

    McCain used the phrase to describe Hillary's healthcare plan -- not Hillary.

    Obama used the phrase to describe...well, he didn't really say.  But I agree with Bill here -- it would be a helluva coincidence for him to be talking about lipstick, in reference to the McCain/Palin ticket, a week after Sarah Palin used it in a widely seen speech.

    And it would be even more of a coincidence if other people, representing the Obama campaign were -- on the very same day -- talking about lipstick and Sarah Palin in the same breath.

    And it would be even more of a coincidence if Obama referenced "old fish" when his opponent is 72-years-old.

    Who in the world do you guys think you're kidding?  Nobody's going to actually buy that this was a coincidental poor choice of words...except, I guess, those who feel they have to convince themselves of that.

    I think the only question is what the impact of the comment will be.

    "...it would be a helluva coincidence for him to be talking about lipstick..."

    Apparently, the term "You can put lipstick on a pig. It&rsquo;s still a pig" is a commonly used term (although I'd never heard it).

    For example:

    Obama about Iraq policy: "George Bush has given a mission to General Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig."

    McCain talking about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's 1990s health care plan: "I think they put some lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig."

    McCain about opponents of President Bush's Iraq strategy:  "It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don't. You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig, in my view."

    Torie Clarke, the former Pentagon communications director in the Bush administration -- a Republican and a woman -- named her book "Lipstick on a Pig: Winning in a No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game."


    So, the McCain campaign is trying to take this comment and twist it like Tom Brady's knee.  It will hurt them in the end and they won't win.

    Jeff, it is a commonly used phrase.  Nobody's denying that.  I've heard it a thousand times.

    It doesn't change any of my points.  You might be able to sell me one of those coincidences.  But when you add all three of them up, I'm not buying.

    - The comment comes a week after she used "lipstick" as a punchline.

    - He also referenced "old fish" (which is not a common expression) while running against a 72-year-old candidate..

    - And Rep. Russ Carnahan, at an Obama/Biden event, introduced Joe Biden by <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Carnahan_Theres_no_way_you_can_dress_up_that_record_even_with_a_lot_of_lipstick.html?showall" rel="nofollow">making a crack about Palin and lipstick</a>.

    Too many coincidences for me to believe it was an accident.  He's rattled and it's showing, IMO.

    I have to say, people see what they want to see, Jeff.  You lay out quotes for them, but they choose to ignore them (or at least interpret them as outlandishly as they want).  See, in their minds, Palin is perfect because she takes issues off the table.  Suddenly, Obama and Biden can't talk about key social issues to the American people (ie: special needs children, teenage pregnancy, equal pay) or even use certain, inane political colloquialisms such as the "lipstick" comment without feigned and grandiose indignation from the right.  As of now (and for the next 50 some-odd days) everything they say will somehow be about Palin.

    I gotta be honest, it was a pretty brilliant strategic move, and I actually think it's going to win them this election.  But hey, look at it this way, people always eventually wise up when policies don't have their best interests in mind - sometimes it just takes longer than 8 miserable years.

    Well, Parker, I'm not the one ignoring the list of assumptions we'd have to make to buy that this was some sort of coincidental poor (or, at least, poorly timed) choice of words.

    So, yeah:  people see what they want to see, indeed.  People also don't see what they don't want to see.

    But you shouldn't read my reaction as outrage, feigned or otherwise.  I think Obama stepped in it here and I'm not a good enough actor to pretend that I'm outraged by it.  Quite the contrary.

    I just know that, with men and women, there are certain verbal lines that shall not be crossed -- and I know this from years of experience crossing them.

    He crossed one.  Fortunately for me, when I do it I usually just have to sleep on the couch for a night or two.  He, on the other hand, has to hope that the female half of the electorate will give him a pass on calling a female opponent a pig (either that or buy into the idea that it was a coincidence).

    It's hard to believe that some of you actually are actually going to determine who our next president will be.  You guys are bickering over words that are being read into.  Please, give it up!  When are you guys going to start focusing on the issues?  Who cares what they say about each other.  Everyone who is on the Palin bandwagon, let's make one thing clear:  She is not ready for the vice presidency.  The GOP knows she is not ready to handle going out alone to campaign, much less the media.  Anyone who wants to argue, then why isn't she doing interviews?  It's because she has no policies.  She has to cram for the vp debates in order to survive them.
         The fact is, the only reason McCain picked Palin is because it was a chess move.  Once they knew that Clinton would not be on the ballot, the picked a woman that they didn't even vet to try and get the Hillary supporters behind them.  It is clearly not because of her experience.  Anyone who wants to argue the point with me, I'll be more than willing.

    Chris said: "You&rsquo;re an idiot. It&rsquo;s an expression."

    Well, yeah.  But, as somebody on another blog pointed out, if the McCain camp responded by saying "that's like the pot calling the kettle black", do you think anybody would buy a defense that this was just a common expression?

    Good grief, we've got Obama supporters telling us that everything from the term "elitist" to mocking "community organizers" is tantamount to playing the race card with code language.

    Yet, we're supposed to accept this at face value?

    I know it's an expression, Chris.  Everybody knows it's an expression.

    But given that it's not the only jocular use of the term "lipstick" by the Obama campaign, you're just not going to convince me that this was some sort of accident.

    If you want to defend it on other grounds, be my guest.  But I wasn't born yesterday.

  content: Obama's lip stick / pig remark ... and, Biden's unsavory children with
    special needs remarks show us what a couple of creeps these two candidates are.
    In lieu of Sarah Palin's comment about hockey moms, pit bulls and lip stick,  Obama's
    lip stick/ pig remark was extremely demeaning. Even though I am not an Obama supporter,
    at least I thought he had some degree of class and sophistication. He can try
    to cover his tracks by saying that the lip stick remark was not directed towards
    Governor Palin, but anyone with half a brain knows that's exactly what he meant.
    I think Obama knows his campaign is in real trouble, and that's why he's stooping
    to such desperate, insulting and distasteful attacks. Obama is definitely not
    Presidential material, and he totally lacks character.

    Well, Brian, for one thing -- she's been in Alaska the last few days taking care of some personal business.  For another, she's sitting down for a 2-day interview with Charlie Gibson tomorrow.

    So there goes that stupid point.

    If you want to make qualification for high office an issue in this campaign, be my guest.  It's not a debate you'll win...it'll just put that much more focus on the fact that Obama's been in the Senate for less than 4 years and running for president half that time.

    And he's not running for VP, he's running to sit in the Oval Office.

    Scott,
      So.  As you see it Obama crossed a line.  I disagree.  He's used the "lipstick" colloquialism before, but I DO agree that it was definitely poorly timed, as you put it.  At the very least I wish he had been savvy enough to foresee people tying any remark with the word "lipstick" in it to Palin's speech last week.  So there.  We agree on something.  Kind of.  :-)

    And now a question for you:  Did you believe that Palin "stepped over a line" with her remarks regarding community organizers?  Did her tone of voice indicate to you any sort of derision to the work that *they* do day in and day out to  better *their* communities?  Do you think more or less media coverage was given to disgruntled community organizers than to disgruntled women and republicans over the "lipstick" comment?

    We both know how I feel about these two situations, but I'm curious to learn what your perspective on this is.  I'm really just trying to understand how you reacted to this particular statment.

    Parker,

    It may have just been unfortunate timing.  But, again, this requires too many assumptions...what with Biden and others cracking on Palin's lipstick line, the "old fish" line with a 72-year-old opponent, etc.

    So, I'm just not buying that this was an accident that looks bad -- and neither did his audience, by the way.

    As for Palin's talk about community organizers and whether it crossed a line, that's for others to determine...just as it is with the "lipstick on a pig" line.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying Obama crossed a line with me.  I'm hardly outraged by this.

    I'm saying that he's probably going to find that he crossed a line with some female voters.  It's a line I've crossed myself with various misguided statements -- so I speak from experience.

    Whether Palin will receive a backlash from the coveted community organizer voting bloc, we'll have to wait and find out.  ;)

    for the interview, I'm anxious to see how well she does.  I believe it will be
    a lot like her Convention speech.  Every speech she has made since then has almost
    been verbatim.  None of which talk policies.  I see her regurgitating a lot of

    Scott,
      I've mulled your comment over and I have to ask you:  What did you mean by this sentence: "Whether Palin will receive a backlash from the coveted community organizer voting bloc, we'll have to wait and find out."?
      Were you being ironic when you used the word "coveted" or were you being smug?  Or both?  Or neither?  Were you trying to be funny?  If so, why?
      Again, I say that people see what they want to see:  some see an opportunity to gain ground with a large voting bloc by highlighting non-policy rhetoric by an opposing candidate, but fail to recognize their own VP candidate's belittling rhetoric aimed at a smaller voting bloc.  Is that bigotry or just good old fashion American competitive spirit?  Who's to say, but we all see what we want to.

    And, by the way, Scott, I fail to see how the crowd picked up on any sort of gaffe.  They seemed to be cheering that Obama was claiming that McCain's claims for change were unfounded.  His manner and demeanor didn't seem in the least directed towards Palin.  He didn't wink or smile or anything.  I don't get it.  Where do you see the insinuation that he's talking about Palin?

    one situation, watching the clip and the crowd reaction where there is no way
    he can defend himself. \nJudging by crowd reaction, it looked very much like a
    covert jab at Palin. \nThe same goes for Biden's comments on developmentally challenged
    children and stem cell research. They are more than able to talk on this subject,
    but when they start saying, \"Parents of developmentally challenged children that
    don't support stem cell research don't care about their kids,\" it is very unacceptable.
    And knowing that Palin has a developmentally challenged child, he just opened
    himself up for criticism. \nObama-Biden, need to start screening what they say
    before they say it. Whether you meant to look like a fool, or whether you just
    slipped up and made yourself look like a fool, bottom line is, you look like a
    fool, intentionally or not."

    I will ive the GOP credit for one thing...they are the masters of spin, and are utterly despicable in their methods.

    Does no one see the hypocrisy in this story???  Biden did not even mention Ms. Palin in his comments about stem-cell research... a very viable if not critical national issue.  An issue that certainly deserves to be discussed and considered!  All the moreso if Palin insists that she will be an advocate for their cause and concerns as she did at her acceptance speech.

    Yet the McCain camp can accuse Biden of "Low-blows" and "desperation" in these comments, only days after falsely accusing Senator Obama of teaching sex-education to kindergardeners as his only accomplishment!!!!

    Discussing the priorities of special needs children and our scientific options without direct reference to a now prominent politician in no way compares to false accusations about laws that were never enacted or supported by an individual specifically named in an issue that is needless to say, a very sensitive topic.

    Obviously, I wont say the McCain camp is smacking of desperation, but they seem to have a no-holds-barred opinion of slander, manipulation, back-stabbing, and outright lying.

    People please wake up!!!  McCain/Palin and their spin campaign only wish to commit you to four more yeas of GOP FAILURE!  Look at our national debt... where our money is... the state of our education system.... our economy.... Halliburton... Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae/Enron......FEMA..... FISA courts.... etc. etc. etc.

    We know thy stole the election in 2000.  Too many of you were still oblivious in 2004 and now most of you admit how poor a president George Bush has been.

    Please people... consider how wrong your republican loyalties have been before blindly supporting this corrupt, dishonest, and self-serving party!!!

    A new McCain strategy!  Anything said by the Obama camp will be distorted into an attack on the Palin.  The lipstick comment refers to dressing up a pork barrel project and the term was first used by McCain himself.  The stem cell comments by Biden addresses those with physical disabilities-not genetic defects such as Downs syndrome but hey, Americans for the most part are poorly informed and don&rsquo;t know the difference which lets McCain twist what is said to make it an insult of his Palin.

    I would like to see the media dissect this new strategy for what it is&mdash;taking advantage of Americans who lack the information to make informed decisions for themselves&mdash;Americans who can be easily manipulated with distortions of the facts.

    tactics.  Talk about desperation, when Mc Cain launched into his "Change" strategy,
    stolen directly from the Obama campaign, that showed true desperation and continuing
    lack of any independent thinking.  I think it's great that the Obama team took
    the gloves off for a bit rather than follow the traditional Democratic strategy
    of taking the high road, letting the Republicans do all the smearing and mud slinging..and
    winning!

  content: Your insinuation that Obama called Palin a pig is itself putting lipstick

    here a moonbat. Could it be that there are just a lot of people who know a colloquialism
    that you are not familiar with? You my friend are the nutjob. Many people on here
    are just telling you the truth of the matter, but you would continue to put lipstick
    on a pig and then just call people names. Sure, Obama has his negatives and many
    of us know them. His stance on the economy, wishy-washines of stance on individuals
    who have been in his life, etc. but you have absolutely no level-headedness to
    your argument at all. You call people out for being left wing, but you are obviously
    right wing. Personally I am an extreme moderate. Fox news is a non-subjective
    news channel? Yeah, right. What is going on in a lot of people's heads right now
    is "We are unsure of Obama, but we don't like McCain." Put another way, I would
    rather vote for the guy I am unsure of but like his positions rather than the
    guy I am sure of and don't agree with his positions.

    attack, refusing to engage the central phony charge and using it to cast McCain
    as unwilling to discuss serious issues.\n\nObama also directly attacked the news
    media for turning the \"controversy\" into a major story. It's worth quoting his
    response at length:\n\n\"Some of you may have -- I'm assuming you guys have heard
    this, watching the news. I'm talking about John McCain's economic politics, I
    say, \"This is more of the same, you can put lipstick on a pig but it's still
    a pig.\" \nAnd suddenly they say, \"Oh, you must be talking about the governor
    of Alaska.\"\n\n[Laughter from audience]\n\nSee it would be funny, it would be
    funny except -- of course the news media all decided that that was the lead story
    yesterday. They'd much rather have the story -- this is the McCain campaign --
    would much rather have the story about phony and foolish diversions than about
    the future.\n\nThis happens every election cycle. Every four years. This is what
    we do. We've got an energy crisis. We have an education system that is not working
    for too many of our children and making us less competitive. We have an economy
    that is creating hardship for families all across America. We've got two wars
    going on, veterans coming home not being cared for -- and this is what they want
    to talk about! this is what they want to spend two of the last 55 days talking
    about.\n\nYou know who ends up losing at the end of the day? It's not the Democratic
    candidate, It's not the republican candidate. It's you, the American people. because
    then we go another year or another four years or another eight years without addressing
    the issues that matter to you. Enough.\n\nI don't care what they say about me,
    but I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies
    and phony outrage and swift-boat politics. Enough is enough.\""

    Excellent point.  I think that Palin was chosen because it gives them an opportunity to cry foul anytime anyone says anything about her.

    On the otherhand, had McCain chosen Bobby Jindal, maybe Obama wouldn't have said, "you can add more garam masala to bad curry, and it is still bad curry".

    "Facing Defeat"
    What election are you watching? Seriously, are you even paying attention? At best, McCain is in a dead-eve tie with Obama as of today - and that's the first time in his entire campaign that he hasn't been behind Obama.

    "called Palin a pig today"
    Since you're blogging, I assume you are also capable of reading and possibly even fact-checking your own statements before making a fool out of yourself. Please do so. Obama most certainly did NOT call Palin a pig. The "lipstick on a pig" analogy used by the entire country has nothing to do with referring to a person as a pig, and I'm sure you're perfectly aware of this but, like the GOP and it's minions, willing to disregard that so that you can jump on the smear bandwagon. The republicans are jumping on anything they can scratch up to complain and cry about to try to bash Obama's character and integrity.
    What do these underhanded, slimy tactics show us all? They show us how truly scared the GOP is of losing... that they can smell their own demise and it's only about 50 days away. Desperate people to desperate things.

    First of all, when McCain made a similar comment he was refering specifically to a policy proposal. I was willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt until I learned that a Biden was introduced at his rally with a lipstick comment-something about "a record you cannot cover up with lipstick". This is typical Obama, make a comment and hide behind it, just like the primaries. Hillary could not show him for what he is because he would pull the race card. You know what else-the comments Biden made about special needs children are ridiculous. Obama camp response it is "about differences in policy not personalities". So how is it a clash of policies if McCain, the Presidential candidate, is for stem cell research.
    This is another attack on the VP candidate and why is Obama's crowd making her the centerpoint-I thought Obama was running for President against McCain? The more he speaks the less presidential he sounds

  content: Wow! Some of you are such idiots. Obama made a simple comparison. The comparison
    was not to Palin, in regards to her being a pig, but to the policies of her and
    her running mate. The comparison merely stated that the policies can be dressed
    up as well as they can dress them, but in the end they all look and smell like
    the policies of the failed Bush administration. Obama is not an idiot. He knew
    exactly what kind of bait he was feeding to the Republicans and they bit all they
    could handle when they reacted the way they did. The same exact comparison was
    used by McCain when speaking of the healthcare plan Hillary was considering, when
    she was in the Race during the primary. Did the Democrats jump up and cry foul?
    No, because it is an old saying that has been used for years. Did Obama speak
    of Palin, yes. He stated that he respected her running for VP , while beaing a
    mother of 5. He stated that he had just two children and they were a hand full
    for him. Her having 5 children and being able to run with all going on was given
    credit on his part. Only a fool would see a headline and not read the complete
    quote. I guess all conservatives are alike. They choose portions of a quote and
    flip it around to work for them. This reaction just made McCain look loke the
    old fool that he is. Every chance he gets, he tries his very best to attack Obama.
    I guess he is just trying his best to avoid the talk about policy issues.

    A presidential candidate should never say it is as Cold as a witches tit up here where the public could hear. The more he speaks away from the teleprompter, the less presidential he sounds because the true man that wants to lead the strongest country in the world comes out.

    the only option left for Republicans is to cry foul. "He is attacking her because
    she is a woman". McCain did not choose her because of policy and what she can
    do for the country. He chose her merely based on the fact that she was a woman.
    He wanted brownie points from women voters and also wanted to be able to use the

    to let herself get pregnant at 44!  We can talk all day about how many special

    still support the fool, will live to regret it. And that, maybe my only solace
    to the ruination of this country.

<p>Reasonable people's opinions of the messiah were already on the down slope, but his resorting to name-calling should pretty much assure his defeat.</p>
<p>He took the time to disguise the insult:&nbsp; "You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig," the Democrat said, referring to Palin's famous ad lib that the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is the lipstick. (Michelle <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/09/you-botched-the-joke-barry-o/" target="_blank">cracks back</a>.)</p>
<p>Obama's sophomoric behavior should give undecided voters caution.&nbsp; There's no doubt that he would not have resorted to low-brow tactics were it not for the polls.&nbsp; McCain's surge of 20 points in a week threaten to put the election out of reach.&nbsp; Even California and New York are now in play for McCain and Palin: a scenario considered ridiculous when the Dems were praying that the God they don't believe in would annihilate New Orleans through Hurricane Gustav.</p>
<p>Obama's incivility followed <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/09/biden.special.needs/index.html" target="_blank">Low Blow Joe Biden's</a> insinuation that Sarah Palin's Down Syndrome baby is moral retribution for Republican opposition to Democrat dreams of harvesting stem cells from murdered babies--a practice Biden supports even if it involves murder.</p>
<p>Obama and Biden are beneath contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps they should appear on the Jerry Springer Show.</p>
<p>**UPDATE** &nbsp;It's amazing how up-in-arms the moonbats get when their boys are caught acting like morons in public over something trivial, but how silent they become when <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/08/obama-the-property-of-freddiefannie-crooks/" target="_blank">Obama's quasi-legal influence peddling</a> with Fannie Mae executives. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>**UPDATE** I missed the interview with O'Reilly tonight, but watched on <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/disaster-barack-obama-gets-chewed-up.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a>. &nbsp;What a pathetic, lying, idiot Obama is. &nbsp;Are you liberals as stupid as he is, or do you like terrorists, racists, and socialists? The Pundit's points:</p>
<blockquote><p>He could not defend or explain his associations with terrorists, racists, and Leftist nutjobs.<br />
He couldn't defend his decision to appease the Daily Kooks.<br />
He compared Sean Hannity and FOX News to the vile nutroots radicals.<br />
He excused Bill Ayers' terrorist attacks.<br />
He could not name one example where FOX News smeared him.<br />
He could not name one conservative friend.<br />
Obama was&nbsp;<em>so bad&nbsp;</em>that O'Reilly started laughing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Glenn Reynolds points out that the "lipstick" meme from Democrats is<a href="http://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/024095.php" target="_blank"> too frequent to be coincidence</a>. &nbsp;Duh. &nbsp;It's called a "talking point." &nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry, moonbats: &nbsp;your defense of your candidate falls short of convincing.&nbsp;</p>
