    Blah blah blah blah -- more lies, mistruths, and accusations from the "poor" old Republicans.  SPREAD THE TRUTH!

    I can remember when the news just reported the facts. You should be ashamed at yourself for spreading lies. You are no journalist. The American people see what you are up to and they don't like it. Shame on you.

  content: No, seriously, folks.  There really were a dozen legit comments caught
    in my spam filter.  Why would anyone lie about something like that?

  content: Tell McCain AND Palin to kiss MY azz!!!  First of all, the lipstick remark
    that Obama made is an OLD cliche and he should not have to apologize for it.  What's
    the problem???  Palin compared herself to a dog with lipstick.  As a matter of
    fact, she compared herself to a particular breed of dog that everyone knows can
    potentially turn on its master.  You republicans should keep that in mind--perhaps
    she was giving you a hint.  The McCain camp thinks that they can release ANY LIE
    about Obama that they want and that he should not respond in any way.  And regardless
    to what he says, whether it's "good morning" or "have a good day", they find something
    wrong with it.  This is ONE FEMALE VOTE that they do NOT have to worry about trying
    to steal from Obama.  And to add to that, just off the top of my head, I can literally
    name at least 50 other women here in this small Texas town who feel the same.

    Anita,

    I know you're liberal and these concepts are a little tough for your little mind to handle, but you're commenting on the  wrong post!  The lipstick post is the next one down.  Please try to pay attention.

<p>I just checked my spam filter and found more than a dozen comments that were not spam. &nbsp;I have released them all.</p>
<p>I apologize to anyone who posted a comment that did not appear in a timely fashion. &nbsp;I'll try to be more diligent about checking the filter.</p>
