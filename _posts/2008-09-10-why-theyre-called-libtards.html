    Bill, your coverage has been outstanding. I've been checking in several times a day to see what you have to say about the Obama meltdown.

    Fun stuff. Keep up the good work.

  content: "Hi, Bill - life-long born and raised Republican here, and I agree with
    most of your points, although I didn't understand your very last line. Thick skins
    and maturity are the hallmarks of all good and great presidents - Barack Hussein
    Obama is more of a whiny butt than Jimma Carter ever was. \n\nThe DNC's meltdown
    is NOT complete, you ain't seen nothin' yet."

<p>The past 24 hours will serve as the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/09/facing-defeat-obama-resorts-to-name-calling/" target="_blank">most embarrassing, self-destructive period in liberalism</a>.&nbsp; These people (liberals) are not only stupid enough to keep <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,420422,00.html" target="_blank">Sarah Palin's name</a> in the headlines, they're stupid enough to piss off 3/4 of the people in the country while doing it.</p>
<p>Ayles and Rollins couldn't have scripted Democrat self-immolation any better.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Biden says <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/10/biden-hillary-might-have-been-better-vp-pick/" target="_blank">Hillary might have been a better choice</a> for Veep.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Democrat Representative <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/10/scenes-from-the-house-floor-jesus-was-a-community-organizer-pontius-pilate-was-a-governor/" target="_blank">Steve Cohen</a> equates <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/10/tennessee-rep-compares-obama-to-jesus-suggests-palin-is-pilate/" target="_blank">Obama with Jesus</a> and Palin with Pontius Pilate from the House podium.</p>
<p>Folks, you couldn't invite this many fruitcakes to one party if you tried.&nbsp; Yet these morons, these simple-minded hate-mongers, have miraculously assembled themselves in the DNC for our curiosity and amusement.</p>
<p>The media have treated Obama the way North Korea's press treats Kim Jong Il, yet he has the balls to blame them for free-fall in the polls?&nbsp; <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/10/obama-attacks-on-me-are-unpatriotic/" target="_blank">What a baby</a>. How spoiled was this son of a bitch?&nbsp; Did he ever in his life hear the word, "No?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Man, I'm glad I'm not a Democrat.&nbsp; Mark Cunningham has a good explanation of <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/09102008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/why_bams_flailing_128293.htm" target="_blank">Obama's free-fall</a>:&nbsp; He's an amateur politician who's never been in a race with a real Republican before.&nbsp; I would add that he's woefully immature and thin-skinned--two qualities vital to the Presidency.</p>
