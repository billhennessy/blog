    "...are sending [U.S. soldiers] out on a task that is from God. That&rsquo;s what we have to make sure that we&rsquo;re praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God&rsquo;s plan."

    By "God", was she referring to George W. Bush or Dick Cheney?

<p>Charlie Gibson extracted an insubordinate clause from a sentence spoken by Sarah Palin with the intent of accusing her of knowing God's mind.&#160; Gibson did this intentionally, lied intentionally, misled intentionally.&#160; <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/abc-news-flops-on-palin-interview.html" target="_blank">His a fraud, a cheat, and a liar</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Palin said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending [U.S. soldiers] out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan.

<p>Smugfuck Gibson's version:</p>
<blockquote><p>our national leaders, are sending [U.S. soldiers] out on a task that is from God.&#160; There is a plan and that that plan is God's plan. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somebody should rearrange Charlie Gibson's teeth. </p>
