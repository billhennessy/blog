<p>Except offend damn near everyone.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8922" align="alignnone" width="300" caption=""So, did you hear the one about the disabled Vietnam veteran who couldn&#039;t even tie his shoes?""]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/358x283.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8922" title="Obama 2008" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/358x283-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Obama Campaign released a mean-spirited attack ad poking fun at John McCain's physical disabilities suffered in combat and as a POW in Vietnam.&nbsp; The injuries left McCain unable to type on a keyboard or use computer.</p>
<p>But<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/13/obama-biden-which-disabled-war-vets-will-they-insult-next/" target="_blank"> Democrats like to make fun of handicapped American veterans</a>, so they jumped all over McCain's limitations with this ad:</p>
<p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ2I0t_Twk0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1]</p>
<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/barack-obamas-attack-ad-misfires.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> has more on the nasty bastard that the Democrats call their standard-bearer.&nbsp; Makes you wonder what kind of people Democrats are, doesn't it?</p>
<p>McCain's disability was well documented over a decade ago in the <a href="http://graphics.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/McCain_character_loyal_to_a_fault+.shtml" target="_blank">Boston Globe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCain gets emotional at the mention of military families needing food stamps or veterans lacking health care. The outrage comes from inside: McCain's severe war injuries prevent him from combing his hair, typing on a keyboard, or tying his shoes. Friends marvel at McCain's encyclopedic knowledge of sports. He's an avid fan - Ted Williams is his hero - but he can't raise his arm above his shoulder to throw a baseball.</p></blockquote>
<p>When Obama said he intended to begin attacking McCain and Palin personally, I had no idea he'd stoop this low. On this point, <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/12/why-cant-mccain-email/" target="_blank">Obama deserves more scorn and derision</a> than any modern presidential candidate.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/#post12652" target="_blank">And he's getting it</a>.</p>
<p>*UPDATE*&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091201259.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> reveals that Barack Obama is continuing to make fun of McCain's war disabilites on the stump.&nbsp; What an evil son of a bitch.&nbsp; I better never again hear a liberal complain about insensitive remarks from a conservative.&nbsp; A liberal is only sensitive when it comes to baby killers and Islamofacsist murders.&nbsp; Evil bastards.</p>
<p>Jonathan Weisman of WaPo, of course, cheers on Obama.&nbsp; If you'd like to tell Jonathan what a panty waste he is, you can<a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/staff/email/jonathan+weisman/" target="_blank"> e-mail him here</a>.&nbsp; If Weisman isn't in bed with Obama, then he's a crappy reporter.&nbsp; Anyone can Google and learn about McCain's physical limitations.</p>
<p>**UPDATE**&nbsp; ABC News today confirmed that McCain can't use a computer because of <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/why-doesnt-mcca.html" target="_blank">war wounds</a>.&nbsp; Obama campaign continuing its despicable ad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evil bastards.
