<p>The African-American press has decided to help Obama by threatening all-out race war in America if McCain wins.&#160; In other words, vote for Obama or die. </p>
<p>Last week, Fatimah Ali, a radical black writer, wrote in the Philadelphia News that if McCain wins, there will be a full-scale race war.&#160;&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>If McCain wins, look for a full-fledged race and class war, fueled by a deflated and depressed country, soaring crime, homelessness - and hopelessness!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Sunday's Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202414_2.html?hpid=opinionsbox1" target="_blank">Randall Kennedy</a>, also African-American, hinted at racial violence if Obama loses.</p>
<blockquote><p>I anticipate that most black Americans will believe that an Obama defeat will have stemmed in substantial part from a prejudice that robbed 40 million Americans of the chance to become president on the day they were born black . . . This conclusion will be accompanied by bitter disappointment, and in some quarters, stark rage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for appealing to people's greatest hopes.&#160; </p>
<p>I feel for Mr. Kennedy.&#160; His closing paragraphs are both touching and sad.&#160; He seems resigned to the fact that Obama will lose and that, in losing, will prove to many a symbol of failure for blacks in America.&#160; </p>
<p>I feel sorry for him and for other blacks who will be devastated by Obama's loss: not because they "deserve" a black President--<a href="http://wizbangblog.com/" target="_blank">no one deserves an identification President</a>.&#160; But because the first African-American to win his party's nomination was unquestionably the wrong guy.&#160; Obama is weak and flawed.&#160; He was rushed into the position, and he wasn't ready.&#160; </p>
<p>I wish I could say that I understand how Kennedy feels.&#160; I can't, of course.&#160; I'm white and Irish and Catholic. But there will be a black President, and he or she will be the right one.&#160; Providence has a way of visiting upon America the leader we need at just the right moment.&#160; The 90s were perfect for Clinton--nothing to do but steer the ship.&#160; The 80s perfect for Reagan--a Cold War needed to end and our self-esteem needed a boost.&#160; Carter allowed Reagan to win.&#160; Bush 43 had the cold anger to push Islamofascist terrorism to the brink of extinction.&#160; Roosevelt reassured Americans and might have prevented all-out communism from taking hold in America.&#160; </p>
<p>I hope there isn't a race war on November 5.&#160; But I won't vote Democrat just because it's threatened.&#160; Nor would I vote Democrat out of guilt or to make Kennedy feel better about himself.&#160; That's like letting someone win a game of one-on-one.&#160; No one deserves that kind of insult.&#160; </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
