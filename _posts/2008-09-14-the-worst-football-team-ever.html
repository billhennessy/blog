<p>The title probably belongs to the 2008 St. Louis Rams. </p>
<p>For the second week in a row, a team without serious injuries humiliated itself, its city, and the players' families on national television.</p>
<p>Defense, offense, and special teams were sickeningly lackadaisical and inept.&#160; It was like watching squirrels do trigonometry.&#160; </p>
<p>If I owned this team, the entire coaching staff would be fired tonight.&#160; </p>
