  content: Hennessy's View is an extremist rightwing fanatical website and that is
    all it is.  Your kind will resort to whatever it takes to achieve your desired
    goals by any means necessary and cares less about the damage it causes in the
    process of getting there. You would rather tear up all of society to achieve those
    goals as you believe that no one can be more right then you and that you know
    what is better for the rest of us then we do.  You would have fit well into Nazi
    Germany's propaganda and disinformation machine for world domination during WWII.  May
    you have an "interesting" future.

    hey dodson,

    These are all facts. FACT:Former Clinton cronies, Raines and Gorelick worked for and took major money out of Freddie by fraud. FACT Raines repaid some of the money he stole (an admission of guilt). They are ruining this country and we are more socialist today then we were yesterday and its people like Barrack, Raines and Gorelick that are paving the way.

  content: Regardless of the issue under discussion, you could blindly copy and paste
    the words of a, probably well intentioned and sincere, but staggeringly simplistic
    lib like dodson as a text book lefty response to "pick your topic".  Someone like
    Hennessy demonstrably takes the time and effort to research facts and statistics
    on a stunningly important and far reaching topic, and uses the resulting foundation
    of facts to form a conclusion.  What does dod come up with?  Mindless cliche drivel
    we have been hearing for decades.  Just once, it would be cathartic to corner
    a dodsonite and challenge their childish name calling and fascistic generalizations
    and see how long it takes for them to curl up in a ball, sobbing.  Punch line
    is, we are destined to repeat history with the current scam candidates that the
    democrats have, again, propped up as stellar representatives of their failed ideology.
    The only hope we have is the libs flake out on election day like they usually
    do.

    @ imadodson

    hey the black helicopters are coming for you.  Put on your tinfoil hat to avoid their "laserguns."

    I know, its not fair to use numbers and facts.  Let me put this in terms you can get.

    Obama's got lots of "bad green things" from the failed "housing companies."

    Does that help?  My gift to you.

    I hope this doesn't come off like water off a duck's back like all the other stuff associated with Obama.  Any other candidate would've gotten drummed out by now.  Heck, Dean got drummed out because of a vocal faux pas, not because of who he was mentored by or who his friends were, or where he got his money.

    They called Reagan the Teflon President, but it wasn't that he was so smooth that nothing stuck to him.  There really wasn't anything to stick to him in the first place.  Obama is Teflon, redefined.  He has more skeletons than a medical school lab, and yet nothing sinks him.  He is truly frightening.  When I go home, I'll spread the word and get this on my blog, and hope that all do the same.

    I'm from the Chicago area, and I know what their politics are there.  I know from whence he comes.  If he wins, God help us all.

    p.s.:  don't forget how much Jesse Jackson's Operation Push got from either Freddie or Fannie, too.

    Wow, this site is nutty. I have 2 questions:

    1. Where does this money really come from? For example, I donate to Obamas campaign and I have to put where I work at. Do the numbers you are giving come from that type of donation? If so, I wouldn't be surprised that , since Obama's campaign funds come from a lot of "little people" as well as big donors, that his share might be large indeed.

    2. Is your question above re: Obama ALLEGEDLY dissing McCains disability a PUSH POLL?   If not, can I see your proof?

    ARE from employees- like you and me. Only about $17,000 is from management on
    up. On McCains side, the higher ups  donated $169,000.  The spin is all in how
    it's stated. That's what makes it so hard to tell what is true and what are half-truths.
    \n\n     I just heard today that it is true that we are all separated by 7 degrees
    of separation- done by a study in which our text messages were followed around
    the world (how is this invasion of privacy allowed?). Doesn't that make us ALL
    associated with each other?"

    he is trying to tie him to a black man as a partner in crime. These men have no
    relationship except race. McCain is pulling out the race card. Fear of blacks
    taking over and doing things against the interests of whites... McCain's looking
    to stir up exactly what one poster expressed, "hey the black helicopters are coming

    In order for the whirly-go-money-round to spin, all the employees have to get their bonuses too, it starts at the top with direction and "leadership" promoting the message and donations that accrued.
    What is not relevant is the donors, who IS relevant are the recipients.

    Down at the bottom of the chart where that figure originally was found on the Federal Election Commission disclosure pages it indicates that the number includes contributions from PACs and individuals.

    Obama received a total of $6,000 from a Fannie/Freddie PAC -- and only prior to his campaign for Presidency, when he announced he would no longer take any lobbyists PAC money.

    The remainder were private donations from individuals who were employees of Fannie/Freddie, from the years between 1989-2008. The two companies at one time had over 12,000 employees.

  content: there is so much information/misinformation that can spread rapidly, but
    the truth can be found FOR THOSE WHO CARE.  Barak Hussein Obama bin Laden is beyond
    belief, and it is incomprehensible how a virtual unknown has come this far with
    so little substance.  There has to have been some kind of mass hypnosis.  The
    media's fawning over him is ridiculously nauseating and embarrassing, and their
    blind eye to his voting record, racist statements that go to the core of who he
    is (read his books), and his totally malevolent wife is stupendously incredible.  Besides
    being tied to all this fraud, he received $200 MILLION in campaign funds from
    the Middle East, under the guise of individual contributions via the internet.  This
    was reported by Maureen Dowd, winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished
    commentary, in THE NEW YORK TIMES on July 14, this year.  (I don't have the link.)
    This should have blown him off the planet, not just out of the race.  His abominations
    are innumerable and inexcusable, but this is inconceivably outrageous, and have
    you heard a word about it?  NOPE.  Not in our liberal, blame-Bush-(or any other
    Rep.) for-everything, idiotic media.  Where is the scrutiny so lavishly applied
    to other candidates?  Not for one minute would he survive OBJECTIVE, FACTUAL,
    revelatory investigation.  This is not about Democrats or Republicans--this is
    about America surviving.  Make no mistake about it, there is true evil going on,
    and we are dead in the water if Obama makes it.

  content: The reason this is not in the mainstream media and in the McCain campaign
    is that it is unsubstatiated hogwash. If you question everything here you will
    find there is no basis in truth to any of this. If the Rebulicans were the campions
    of the middle class they are now pretending to be the rich would not have had
    the largest boon since the inception of our great nation during their rule. There
    would have been protection for the average American and we would not be in the
    mess we are in now. I do not know how the conservatives can be so cynical to say
    this is all the democrats and clintons fault after the rebulicans have been in
    power for most of the last twenty years. Wake up and smell the coffee. If you
    can't lead, get out of the way. As an american I am fed up with both parties name
    calling and whining, SHUT UP AND MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN WORTHWHILE. The Rebulicans
    had their chance, and now we can watch the democrat screw up in a new and exciting
    way. Hennesey article is not constructive however.

    Dodd, Raines, Frank, Delay, all belong in prison along with every sitting member
    of congress. If you believe this is some bias story made up by political opponents
    your as nutty as the folks still fawning over Obama. The truth is right in front
    of you. For all Bushes faults he was probably the least corrupt man in Washington
    for the last eight years. The fact that he sat on his ass as both sides of the
    isles fed at the public troft says much about the worthless leader he was. Corruption
    is destroying this country, thousands of tax paying citizens have lost there savings,
    homes, jobs and the destruction goes on and on. Any American that votes for any
    incumbent in Washington is a fool.

    A few webs did carry this story, as I used to post it on forum to try and educate the liberal obama voters during the campaign.  So they knew Raines and other executives were cooking the books and eventually  directly and/or indirectly caused the housing crisis.

    George Bush tried several times to get an bill passed in Congress to investigate and put more SEC regulations on FM and FM because he warned the public they were in danger of bankruptcy and the housing crisis.  But they dems blocked it every time.

    Of course the MSM wouldn't cover this, like a bunch of paparazzi on steroids, they were much too busy dissing Sarah Palin's children.

<p>As an executive at Fannie Mae, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washbizblog/2008/04/regulator_to_dismiss_charges_a.html" target="_blank">Franklin Raines</a> illegally coerced his employees to falsify accounting facts so he'd get a maximum bonus.&nbsp; The government-backed firm used Enron-like fraud, in part at Raines's orders, to create the largest bail-out in US history. Raines had the <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2008/07/14/morning-bell-the-lefts-crony-capitilism-exposed/" target="_blank">whistleblower</a> fired.&nbsp; From the Heritage Foundation:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2004, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB109770752803244715.html?mod=Review-Outlook-US">after a tip from a whistle blower who was later fired</a>, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (Ofheo) issued a report finding that the government-sponsored entity Fannie Mae had engaged in Enron-like accounting machinations that allowed Fannie to overstate its earnings and underestimate the risk the company faced. The accounting wizardry Fannie engaged in was designed so that Fannie could meet profit targets to<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB109684359646434797.html?mod=Review-Outlook-US">maximize bonus payments to company executives</a> like Clinton administration deputy attorney general Jamie Gorelick and Carter administration assistant director for domestic policy Franklin Raines.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the ACU:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following his tenure in Democrat Bill Clinton's White House as Budget Director, Raines returned to Fannie Mae where he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer prior to being forced out over accounting fraud allegations that federal authorities claimed were used to pad his own pocket with tens of millions of dollars in un-earned bonuses on top of his multi-million dollar pay. Raines and other top executives drew multi-million dollar salaries at Fannie Mae for many years.</p>
<p>Although he claimed no wrong doing, Raines agreed to settle the suit with the federal government just this year and agreed to pay back a few million of the near $50 million it had been alleged he obtained illegally through bonuses not due from Fannie Mae.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, this criminal is Barack Obama's campaign adviser.&nbsp; Only one member of Congress, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB109770752803244715.html?mod=Review-Outlook-US" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Barney Frank</span></a><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">,</span> Chris Dodd, received more <a href="http://www.newsmeat.com/ceo_political_donations/Franklin_Raines.php" target="_blank">kickbacks from Raines's Fannie Mae</a> cronies than did Barack Obama--over $120,000 in bribes.</p>

<p>Dodd has been in Congress since Moses was a baby.&nbsp; What did Obama do in 2.5 years to earn nearly as&nbsp; much cash from Frannie and Freddie as Dodd earned in 25?</p>
<p>Remember Countrywide?&nbsp; According to BusinessWeek <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0708/Advice_from_Raines.html" target="_blank">Obama's financial adviser</a>, Raines, was responsible for its demise, too:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Countrywide project deemed, "friends of Angelo" or FoA, standing for Friends of Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo, apparently provided special loan rates for connected officials. These included Raines, James Johnson (a Democratic party activist and adviser to Sen. Barack Obama who was named to a panel to help choose Obama's Vice Presidential running mate), Democrat Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Christopher Dodd, and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Democrat Kent Conrad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac control almost 50 percent of all mortgages in the United States.&nbsp; They were started by Democrats, protected by Democrat, funded by Democrats, and absorbed into the government proper at the behest of their paid hacks in the Democrat party.&nbsp; Conservatives have advocated the demolition of these twin towers of corruption, fraud, and bribery for decades.&nbsp; But Democrats blocked every attempt to even hold hearings on corruption in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>But where are the Congressional hearings?&nbsp; Where is the Department of Justice?&nbsp; Why aren't Raines, Johnson, and Obama doing a perp walk on the evening news?</p>
<p>Because liberals OWN Washington.&nbsp; Obama will threaten, lie, and kill if he must to keep his sham campaign going.&nbsp; At this point, he must win to stay of prison.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that conservative bloggers and talk show hosts are staying away from this story.&nbsp;&nbsp; This should be the end of Barack Obama, particularly after today's disaster on Wall Street:&nbsp; Dow down >500, Lehman Brothers GONE, Bear Stearns GONE, Merrill Lynch GONE, Fannie Mae GONE, Freddie Mac GONE, AIG GOING, more to follow.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers, too, contributed the lion's share of its political donations to DEMOCRATS.&nbsp; Why don't you people rise up and demand some goddamn ACCOUNTABILITY!&nbsp; This isn't some little $10 million Chrysler bailout here.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're talking BILLIONS of STOLEN MONEY.&nbsp; Stolen by Democrats, for Democrats.</p>
<p>We could face an economic DEPRESSION because of Obama, Dodd, Biden, Frank, Pelosi, Kennedy, and the rest of the Democrat criminals who've destroyed the housing market, put families on the streets, and wrecked Wall Street through greed and avarice on a scale unseen since the Roman Empire!</p>
<blockquote><p>Fannie also bought off activist groups such as the <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2008/07/08/do-you-want-your-mortgage-payments-funding-voter-fraud/">corrupt Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)</a>, which has been indicted, multiple times across the country, for vote fraud (<a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTcxMDhjOTc2MGI0OTE1Y2QyMDYwYWE5MGY3OWJmY2I=">Obama worked closely with ACORN as a street organizer in Chicago</a>). Fannie&rsquo;s lobbying efforts paid off as liberal politicians such as Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. William Clay (D-Mo.) worked t<a href="http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed062305a.cfm">o kill any real reform of Freddie and Fannie</a>. The Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/13/AR2008071301462_pf.html">reports</a>: &ldquo;In an internal memo in 2004, Fannie Mae executive Daniel H. Mudd affirmed what the company&rsquo;s critics had long contended: In the political arena, &lsquo;we always won&rsquo; and &lsquo;we took no prisoners.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>WAKE UP AND TAKE IT BACK!&nbsp; <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/f/franklin_raines.html" target="_blank">It's YOUR MONEY</a>.</p>
<p>I'll say it again without any fear of error:&nbsp; Franklin Raines is&nbsp; a criminal and Barack Obama is his paid accomplice.&nbsp; Prove me wrong.</p>
<p>*UPDATE 1/4/2009: &nbsp;Michelle Malkin has a wonderful post on<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/04/who-says-conservative-bloggers-dont-do-reporting/" target="_blank"> original reporting by conservative bloggers</a>. &nbsp;While this piece might not be original, the analysis certainly is. &nbsp;This is, as far as I can tell, the only graphical analysis showing that Barack Obama received more money from Frannie Mae and Freddie Mac crooks than any other&nbsp;politician&nbsp;when measured in dollars per day in office.</p>
