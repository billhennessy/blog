  content: 'McCain campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb was spot on in his assessment
    of Tumulty''s nonsense: "<a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/McCainReport/Read.aspx?guid=f56407e8-60e5-4c39-a24a-aa5734596374"
    rel="nofollow">hysterical liberal bias</a>."  She should take a long, hard look
    at herself to figure out why she saw "sinister images of two black men" in an
    ad about a politician and a fraudster.'

<p>Time magazine's <a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/mccain_plays_the_race_card.html" target="_blank">Karen Tumulty</a> says that criticizing Franklin Raines--the heart and soul of our current economic near-meltdown--is racism because . . . <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/19/time-reporter-mccains-franklin-raines-ad-is-racist-because-um-he-released-it-before-the-jim-johnson-one/" target="_blank">Raines is black</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, criticizing any black is racism.</p>
<p>I've <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/08/obama-the-property-of-freddiefannie-crooks/" target="_blank">criticized</a> and <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/15/franklin-raines-criminal-enterprise-and-barack-obama-his-accomplice/" target="_blank">accused</a> Franklin Raines brutally in the past two weeks, so I must be a regular David Dukes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps Karen Tumulty needs to change her meds.</p>
<p>Readers may not believe this, but I didn't realize Raines was black until after I'd posted the second of my blog posts linking to Obama to Raines and Johnson and others responsible for the housing bubble and meltdown.&nbsp; Not that I'd have done anything differently.&nbsp; But until Obama's candidacy, we were living something like a post-racial period.&nbsp; It was wackos like Tumulty who reinvigorated race in American politics--not Obama's candidacy and not the right.&nbsp; It was the people who make a fortune fomenting racial hatred.&nbsp; And they should be driven out on rail.</p>
