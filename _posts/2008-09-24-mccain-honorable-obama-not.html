    I don't mean to change the subject, but did you see the Palin interview with Couric.

    Who do you think McCain is going to choose for VP after he lets her go?

<p>John McCain took an enormous risk today by <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccain-pulls-out-of-debate-due-to.html" target="_blank">suspending his campaign</a> for President in order to do his job as a Senator, party leader, and statesman.&#160; He returned to Washington to help prevent an economic depression brought about by Obama's financial advisors, among others.</p>
<p>Barack Obama ratcheted up the heat on McCain and Bush, blaming them for what his friends have done to America. </p>
<p><a href="http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/09/24/breaking-john-mccain-suspends-campaign-to-go-to-washington-for-bailout-debate.php" target="_blank">McCain is noble and honorable</a>; Obama is a putz.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE48N8AV20080924" target="_blank">Obama said today</a> this is the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, yet it doesn't rise to a level requiring him to actually do his job.&#160; </p>
<p>Anyone who votes for Obama after all this deserves the cesspool of a country that the commie from South Chicago hopes to deliver.&#160; But what about the rest of us?&#160; Where do we go to get our liberty back? </p>
