<p>On the night that the President of the United States described America's current economic condition in terms reminiscent of the Great Depression comes word from <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Johnson_to_lead_Obama_briefing.html" target="_blank">Ben Smith</a> at Politico that one of the chief architects of the next depression, Countrywide and Fannie Mae thief James Johnson, is advising Barack Obama on how to proceed on this crisis.</p>
<p>Smith quotes former Senator Tom Daschle:</p>
<p>Jim Johnson and I have scheduled another informal breakfast discussion and update on the campaign early next month.</p>
<p>Taking the advice of a disgraced national criminal like Johnson, and doing so with no shame or attempt at concealment, demonstrates the maddening hubris of Barack Obama.&#160; It's one of the many factors that make the man truly hate-able.&#160; More hate-able than Bill Clinton ever was.</p>
<p>There's no doubt as to why Obama must work with Johnson:&#160; Johnson, Franklin Raines, and their minions at Fannie Mae and Countrywide have given money to Obama at historic rates.&#160; Few politicians of any party have received so much cash in so short a time from so small a cadre as Obama's received from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac personnel:&#160; $42,000 a year since Obama's entered the Senate.&#160; By contrast, the second-place bribe-taker, Hillary Clinton, has received $10,000 a year.&#160; </p>
