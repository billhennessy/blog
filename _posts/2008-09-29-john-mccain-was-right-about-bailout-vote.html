<p>Barry "Himmler" Obama mocked John McCain for claiming that the administration's $700 billion bailout plan lacked the votes to pass. &nbsp;At the White House meeting last Thursday, Obama was insulting and abusive to everyone in the room. &nbsp;The man who didn't know that the inauguration is in January and not November appeared not to know that he wasn't President.</p>
<p>Turns out McCain was right. &nbsp;Even after making progress in Washington last week and over the weekend, the bailout package still lacked a majority in the House. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Forty percent of Democrats voted against the bill, along with two-thirds of Republicans. &nbsp;Republicans who voted against the bill cited constituent opposition and Nancy Pelosi's post-agreement bitch-session from her pulpit in the House Chamber.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kudos to the GOP Representatives who had the courage to vote against the bill.</p>
