<p>so this will be my only post--a series of thoughts on the day.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Armageddon</strong></p>
<p>In case you were too busy with your normal life and missed it, the financial armageddon promised/threatened by President Bush, Nancy Pelosi, Hank Paulson, and every other power freak on the planet failed to materialize. &nbsp;The Dow ended up 485 points, erasing well over half of yesterday's losses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Congress does something stupid, let's just see what happens if we, the people, are left to our own devices--the way the founders planned it and the way it worked for 150 years before do-gooder morons fucked everything up.</p>
<p><strong>Obama and Franklin Raines</strong></p>
<p>I can't believe the punk has balls to strut around blaming Republicans for the bribes he took to help Fannie Mae bring us to the bring of the financial crisis that I don't trust politicians to rescue us from. &nbsp;But he has them, swinging in the wind like bull preparing to enter the ring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He'll get his.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Savage Grows On You</strong></p>
<p>You have to listen to this. &nbsp;Michael Savage on the financial crisis. &nbsp;Great wisdom hear. &nbsp;Listen and thank me later. &nbsp;<a href="http://michaelsavage.wnd.com/" target="_blank">(the spiritual site of the downturn)</a></p>
<p>Nite nite.</p>
