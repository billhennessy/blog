<p>The Senate will vote on<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/0208/09/30/flash-senate-bailout-vote-scheduled-tomorrow-at-approx-9pm-eastern/" target="_blank"> Socialism for Billionaires II</a> tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. &nbsp;TELL YOUR SENATOR TO VOTE NO!</p>
<p>One-third of the Senate is up for re-election this year. &nbsp;Make sure they all know that a vote for the bailout is a vote for unemployment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've written Senators Bond and McCaskill. &nbsp;You need to let yours know that you like 485-point Dow advances, and you don't want Congress screwing up our bull market. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Socialism is no way to run a democracy. &nbsp;Tell your Senator NO!</p>
