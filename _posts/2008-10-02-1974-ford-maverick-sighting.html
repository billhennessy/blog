<p><img src="http://hotair.cachefly.net/images/2008-10/palin-wavedebate.jpg" alt="Sarah" align="left" />Today's my dad's 84th birthday. &nbsp;I went to see him and my mom after work. &nbsp;My sisters Mickey and Tee showed up, and Tee's husband Gary. &nbsp;We drank some Budweisers and laughed.</p>
<p>I headed home about 7:30. &nbsp;As I turned left off of Germania onto Gravois, an orange (not original color) 1974 Ford Maverick made a right off Hampton right in front of me. &nbsp;It took a second for my mind to make the connection. &nbsp;Maverick.</p>
<p>I took it as a good omen.</p>
<p>I heard the first question of the debate on the radio in my car. &nbsp;Palin's answer, following Biden's, was good. &nbsp;On TV she was even better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Others will dissect the debate, so I'll stay with impressions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Biden was the better debater. &nbsp;Palin won. &nbsp;Biden lied or was factually wrong on 10 points. &nbsp;Palin was factually wrong on none. &nbsp;Biden never stumped Palin, but Palin perplexed Biden once and decisively. &nbsp;I don't remember the question, the answer, or the subject, but it sent Biden stammering like his hero, Obama.</p>
<p>The winning line was Palin's shoutout to her brother's 3rd graders at some elementary school who get extra credit for watching the debate. &nbsp;Killer. &nbsp;No career politician would think of it. &nbsp;No squirrel like Obama could pull it off.</p>
<p>It was a 100 percent victory for the mom from Wasilla. She overplayed the privilege of answering the previous question, but that doesn't matter. &nbsp;She was nails. &nbsp;she connected. &nbsp;<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/02/luntz-focus-group-palin-in-a-blowout/">Frank Lutz's independent</a>s move from undecided to McCain by a 9 to1 margin because Palin was money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Money. &nbsp;That's her new name. &nbsp;<a href="http://">Sarah is money</a>. So money.</p>
<p>Peggy Noonan was on 97.1 FM in St. Louis this morning. &nbsp;She didn't expect much from Sarah Palin in the debate. &nbsp;Tonight Peggy admitted she was wrong.</p>
