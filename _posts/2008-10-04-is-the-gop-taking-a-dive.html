<p>Somewhere between The Republican National Convention and the first debate on September 26, John McCain left the race.&nbsp; It's as if the McCain campaign remains on suspension pending resolution of the economic crisis.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>It's possible, of course, that McCain is simply inept at closing the deal.&nbsp; As every baseball fan knows, closers don't grow on trees.&nbsp; Many fine pitchers flounder in the ninth inning with a narrow lead.&nbsp; They're not all Bob Gibson. Some panic upon seeing the white tape of the finish line.&nbsp; </p>
<p>McCain doesn't strike me as that type.&nbsp; If for no other reason, he seemed to grow stronger as the GOP nomination came closer to his grasp.</p>
<p>With a little over a month to go in his race for the White House McCain held a slight lead in the national polls and had taken the lead in the battleground states--Florida, Virginia, Ohio, New Mexico, Nevada, and others.&nbsp; He held the electoral vote lead.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then he quit.</p>
<p>I can't help but wonder what he learned in Washington on September 24 and 25.&nbsp; What did President Bush, Ben Bernanke, and Henry Paulson reveal that changed McCain's mind about winning the White House?&nbsp; Is it possible that something awful is about to happen to America--something so awful that the party in power will sink to unimaginable depths in public trust and public opinion?&nbsp; Did McCain figure out the next president will be the next Hoover?</p>
<p>When the House passed the economic rescue bill on Friday morning, the stock market fell.&nbsp; Up more than 100 points before the vote, by the time the House roll call was complete, the Dow was hovering slightly above neutral.&nbsp; Within an hour, it was 150 points below zero and remained there.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. Eastern, news reports began flowing in that showed the trillion dollar package would have little effect on the credit paralysis sweeping the globe.&nbsp; Banks and governments in <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122313566316305169.html">Europe announced more financial problems</a> than solutions.&nbsp; Ireland, France, Germany, the UK seem to worry that something terrible is about to sweep their continent.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the credit freeze brought on primarily by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recklessness followed by commercial bank imitations has set the world's economy on a collision course with squalid destiny?</p>
<p>A week ago, I was convinced that McCain would win the election handily. I did not expect him to quit this early.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://jammiewearingfool.blogspot.com/2008/10/welcome-to-camp-obama.html">Barack Obama is a Marxist</a> who will bring some degree of <a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/video-shows-obama-youth-preparing-for.html">Soviet-style communism</a> to the country that introduced the modern world to the democratic republic.&nbsp; If whatever is about to happen seems worse than that to McCain, whatever's coming must be really, really scary and big.&nbsp; </p>
