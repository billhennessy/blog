    Speaking of prison, why isn't the smear artist "Charley James" in prison along with them? The guy who spread lies about Sarah is now going after John McCain, a genuine American hero.

    I bet he went to Hanoi with that other traitor Jane Fonda.

<p>Barney Frank (D-MA)</p>
<p>Chris Dodd (D-CT)</p>
<p>Maxine Waters (D-CA)</p>
<p>Lacy Clay (D-MO)</p>
<p>Gregory Meeks (D-GA)</p>
<p>Charles Rangel (D-NY)</p>
<p>These Democrats were the most vicious in attacking Republicans who tried to stop the abuses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003-2006.&nbsp; These criminal Congressmen accused anyone of challenging the soundness and safety of Fannie and Freddie of racism. "The political lynching of Franklin Raines," was was Lacy Clay of Missouri called an auditor's report on Fannie Mae.</p>
<p>These Democrats, who personally profited from the abuses, caused the $200 billion Fannie/Freddie bailout in July.&nbsp; They caused the $850 billion bailout of October 3.&nbsp; They placed the future of our country at risk for their own personal gain.</p>
<p>Why are the not in jail?&nbsp; Is it because Dodd is powerful?&nbsp; Because Frank is gay?&nbsp; Because Meeks, Water, Clay, Obama, and Rangel are black?</p>
<p>Of course it is.&nbsp; And in this country liberals, gays, and blacks are above the law.</p>
