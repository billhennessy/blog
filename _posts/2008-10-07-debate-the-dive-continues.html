<p>After showing signs of life following Sarah Palin's top-shelf performance against Joe Biden on Friday, McCain reminded me of an addict who fell off the wagon. He's addicted to boredom.&nbsp; It was like previous horrendous performances by Republican Senior Guardsmen:&nbsp; Bob Dole in 1996, George H. W. Bush in 1992.&nbsp; Did McCain look at his watch?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, folks, but this guy does not want to be president. I have no doubt that he did.&nbsp; He lost the will to win when he suspended his campaign to what the hell George had done to the economy.&nbsp; As I wrote last night, whatever George, Henry, Barney, Barack, Chris, and Lacy have done with the nation's financial markets is beyond McCain's ability to fix.&nbsp; In fact, it's beyond anyone's ability to fix unless that someone's life ambition is to be known as "Hoover II."&nbsp;&nbsp; The next president will be a one-termer. </p>
<p>"Fight with me!&nbsp; Stand with me and fight with me!"&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please.&nbsp; Now that some of us have climbed into the ring, it would be nice if the instigator would join us.&nbsp; </p>
