<p>The world's financial systems are succumbing to fear and negative in exponentially increasing spasms that threaten shatter to more than 200 years of economic development. </p>
<p>Major US corporations are now on the precipice of surrender with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/gm-falls-1950-levels-european/story.aspx?guid={C503DCF6-2571-42CD-AFA4-682958304034}">GM's</a> price plummeting and GE quietly informing SEC that it fears it will not be able to obtain cash needed to maintain operations. </p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081009/meltdown_stock_market_fear.html">Dow Industrial Average</a> fell more than 600 points today and has lost almost half of its value since its all-time high.&nbsp; The Japanese <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/japanese-indexes-fall-more-7/story.aspx?guid={C3147B3E-1B07-4F43-95FA-1E8FDE81A6EF}&amp;dist=hplatest">Nikkei</a> is down 11 percent in early Friday trading, leading indices across Asia into a free-fall.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The combined loss of wealth and confidence <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/02/pdf/c1.pdf">threaten to plunge the world</a> into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/09/eichengreen.depression/index.html">an economic depression not seen since the 1930s</a>.&nbsp; From the International Monetary Fund's Outlook released today:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world economy is now entering a major downturn<br>in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature<br>financial markets since the 1930s. Against an exceptionally<br>uncertain background, global growth projections<br>for 2009 have been marked down to 3 percent,<br>the slowest pace since 2002, and the outlook is subject<br>to considerable downside risks. The major advanced<br>economies are already in or close to recession, and,<br>although a recovery is projected to take hold progressively<br>in 2009, the pickup is likely to be unusually<br>gradual, held back by continued financial market<br>deleveraging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A majority of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/10/prospects_for_o.html">Wall Street Journal's economists</a> now predict a recession in the US to extend at least 9 months--the longest in 50 years.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some steps I would take:</p>
<p>* Fire <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boom2bust.com/2008/10/06/did-secretary-paulson-mislead-president-bush-on-the-bailout/">Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke</a>.&nbsp; Each time either man speaks, people around the world lose confidence in the financial systems.&nbsp; However stupid or corrupt they might be is irrelevant at this point.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODJiMGE4YTZlN2M1MDhlYjc4MDhjMjk3MWJiYTIxNTg=">They are net drains on the world economy</a>.</p>
<p>* Rapidly indict executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&nbsp; These two companies are primarily responsible for the meltdown in economic value and the inflation of real estate the fueled the collapse.&nbsp; People want someone to fry for this, and Jim Johnson, <a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/09/fannie-mae-fatcatfriend-of-obama-buys-49-million-penthouse/">Franklin Raines</a>, and Jamie Gorelick are the perfect candidates.</p>
<p>* Leave the stock market closed for two days next week.&nbsp; Let people take a breather.</p>
<p>* <a target="_blank" href="http://theeprovocateur.blogspot.com/2008/10/dow-5000or-what-happens-when-government.html">Stop throwing new policies at an information-overloaded public</a>.&nbsp; The $700 billion bailout bill following the $200 billion Fannie/Freddie bailout and the AIG bailout, and the myriad other bailouts and schemes have not even begun to work.&nbsp; No mas, at least until we see the results of actions already taken.</p>
<p>* Shut down all federal government programs begun after 1930.&nbsp; A loss in faith in the US government's credit worthiness now would flood the world with US dollars, kicking off inflation at the 300 percent annual level.&nbsp; </p>
<p>* Stop all payments to foreign governments and the UN.</p>
<p>* Ratchet up military spending to prepare for a 4-million man force.&nbsp; Our enemies will use our economic hardship as an opportunity to attack.&nbsp; Skyrocketing unemployment will make many people eager for a job in uniform.&nbsp; Spending on weapons and supplies will offset stagnation in the private sector.&nbsp; This combination will make the military the best use of the dollars the federal government has left.</p>
<p>* Begin developing plans for a WPA type program.&nbsp; We are likely to see unemployment rates between 10 and 20 percent beginning in 3Q09 and continuing for several years.&nbsp; Welfare doesn't work--people must earn a living. </p>
<p>* Do NOT elect Barack Obama and a Democrat Congress.&nbsp; They will institute a <a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/09/obama-the-socialist-new-party-and-the-socialist-bush-treasury-department/">Marxist-style government</a> using the economic calamity as justification.&nbsp; If this happens, you will not a free country back in your lifetime.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sorry for the bad news, folk.&nbsp; I hope and pray that I'm wrong, but everything tells me I'm right. </p>
