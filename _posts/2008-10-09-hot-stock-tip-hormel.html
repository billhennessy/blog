<p>St. Louis--One company expected to surge amidst the economic chaos about to plague the planet:&#160; Hormel Foods, makers of the famous poverty meat, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spam.com/">Spam</a>.</p>

<p>"I like Hormel," Wachovia food analyst Walter Crimsin told Hennessy's View.&#160; "Families that are lucky enough to avoid the soup kitchens will be looking for value in their animal protein purchases.&#160; Spam has been a staple poverty food since before the last Depression, and I think it'll outperform the market in this one."</p>
<p>Spam is a "mystery meat" which has some of the color and approximate texture of meat, but tastes like a pliable sort of goo.&#160; </p>
<p>In related business news, Wall Street analysts project the burgeoning carbon credit industry will collapse as the world faces actual problems.&#160; Industry expert Len Wilson of Bank of America:</p>
<p>"Bill, we all enjoyed playing the carbon credit markets when the economy was booming and no one had any real concerns, unless of course you had a kid in Iraq or somewhere.&#160; Now that we have a real problem, though, investors won't have an appetite for simulated crises like global warming."</p>
<p>Concern over increased rates of obesity are also expected to recede as Americans return to physical occupations and have nothing to eat but Spam and similar potted meats. </p>
