  content: LOL!!! You're one sick and jealous puppy. White boys like you are sad.
    Are you upset because all of your white buddies don't have the intellect or drive
    to beat out a blackman for the Presidency? Why haven't you run for Preident yet
    since you have such a strong opinion? You're pathetic and a sorry excuse for an
    American. Obama thrashes anybody in front of him. IT'S OVER!!!!! Take yo' white
    ass somewhere else if you can't take a blackman being President. Say... Europe?LOL!!!
    You're pathetic.

    BHO was the first and only editor of the Harvard law Review to NOT receive a clerkship position from a federal judge.

    Now, Harvard still accepts black students with lower LSAT scores than whites or Asians. So the rot of affirmative action still is working there.

    A federal judge would welcome the chance to offer a black law student a clerkship. It would be good for his career. But he is not going to offer a clerkship to a so-so student, and risk his own career, just to have offered it to a black student. Judges rely on the clerks to do research and write position papers. The mediocre need not apply.

    Thus you can safely infer that federal judges, discreetly checking with the faculty, got the "Oh, no!" wink from Harvard Law, and avoided offering a clerkship to BHO.
    Actually, his below-average studying is the least of our worries if he become president.

<p>It's time to knock off the niceties about Barack Obama and race.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Barack Obama has a college education, political office, and a name because he black and from a broken home.&nbsp; He happened to hit college age when it was still vogue to promote minorities through the education system, including Harvard Law, regardless of their abilities.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As a result of the misguided, dangerous attempts by guilt-ridden liberals to right a wrong they did not commit, America is on the brink of electing a mentally deficient Marxist president.</p>
<p>Thanks, you lefties.</p>
<p>In our private lives, we've all run across the affirmative action hires with affirmative action degrees.&nbsp; We're just not allowed to talk about it.&nbsp; It's the woman or black man who doesn't really speak the language at a level expected of a white male.&nbsp; It's manager or vice president in an organization who can't understand the simple financial formula, and the "complexity" of the formula, which it's his or her job to understand, that becomes the center of the discussion rather than the strategy the formula's result indicates. </p>
<p>I won't go into the virtues of affirmative action, because it has none.&nbsp; Promoting individual members of a group beyond the level of their capabilities simply because it makes a white man feel good is racism, plain and simple.&nbsp; Dumbing down schools, both inner-city elementary and prestigious university, to alllow more favored minorities to "pass" has damaged our society and economy for 30 years.&nbsp; Now it threatens to end America's experiment with democracy.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, like the good child of affirmative action that he is, knows how to game the racial political correctness system like no other.&nbsp; In six months, he has smeared Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Geraldine Ferraro, John McCain, and Sarah Palin as racists simply because they oppose turning the White House into another affirmative action set-aside.&nbsp; In this he has shown himself to be post-partisan:&nbsp; anyone who opposes him -- regardless of party -- does so because Omama is black and the opponent racist. At least in Obama's feeble little mind.</p>
<p>Further, our sickening political correctness demands silent stupidity.&nbsp; We are expected to understand that by accusing Obama of learning his hatred of capitalism and his embrace of communism from a white terrorist and white communist, we become racists. Not anti-Semites, mind you, but anti-black.&nbsp; We are not allowed to question the self-appointed truth police on the matter.&nbsp; Because the accuser is black, we must not point out the ignorance of his idiotic comments.&nbsp; Don't want to hurt the poor fellow's feelings.</p>
<p>ENOUGH!</p>
<p>John McCain has an obligation, if he truly puts his country first, to point out Obama for what he is:&nbsp; an ill-educated neo-Marxist whose credentials were bought solely on the color of his skin and with glaring disregard for his flawed character and inferior intellect.&nbsp; And it's high time blacks who EARNED their stature--men like Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell, J. C. Watts, and millions of others--stood by McCain and explained the matter.&nbsp; Giving away degrees to blacks on the premise that blacks are too stupid to earn them like everyone else is the lowest form of racism that ever existed.&nbsp; Yet it is the official policy of Barack Obama's party. </p>
