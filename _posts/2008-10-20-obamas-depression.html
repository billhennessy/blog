<p>Say you work for a good-size, privately held company called X-Dyne Inc.&nbsp; X-Dyne has revenues of $2 billion a year and employs 4,000 people.&nbsp; Last year, X-Dyne's EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) was $20,000.&nbsp; After taxes, the company made $11.1 million in profits. </p>
<p>The company used those profits to fund this year's growth investments:&nbsp; hiring new employees, advertising and sales, research and development.&nbsp; Because the company's strategy is to fund all growth with internal profits, it keeps a healthy bank account to continue operations should a large client leave the firm or should the economy turn down.</p>
<p>Then Barack Obama became president, and Democrats won powerful majorities in both Houses of Congress.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obama increased the effective corporate tax rate from 40.9 percent (according to The Economist) to 55 percent.&nbsp; With the economy weak, Obama had to go after corporate profits because individual incomes of the 5 percent were insufficient to fund the trillions of dollars in new programs he promised.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So X-Dyne has a double-barrel problem:&nbsp; the economy reduced it's 2009 profit estimates from $11.1 million (zero growth) to $8 million; Obama took 55 percent of that 8 million, leaving your employer with only $3.6 million.&nbsp; That's&nbsp; What would a responsible business do?</p>
<p>First, X-Dyne would reduce payrolls enough to recover at least half of the $7.5 million lost to the slowing economy and Obama's tax increase.&nbsp; Assuming that the total cost of employment for its employees is $100,000 a year (about $70,000 salary), it would have to lay off about 325 people.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you're one of those 325, will you be happy with the tax cut Obama's promising 95 percent of Americans?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Suppose you're not one of the 325.&nbsp; Suppose you keep your job.&nbsp; X-Dyne, in order to prevent further lay-offs in future years, decides to recover some the remaining $3.25 million deficit by a combination of a) 5 percent salary cut, b) 20 percent increase employee's contribution to healthcare premiums, and c) eliminate of 401k contribution matching.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Will the $800 annual tax cut from Obama offset the $3,500 pay cut, the $800 increase in health insurance, and the 50 percent cut in your retirement savings?&nbsp; </p>
<p>No.&nbsp; In exchange for an $800 tax cut, you lost at least $4,300 dollars in income.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's IF you were one of the lucky ones to keep your job.</p>
<p>The only economic reason to vote for Obama is if you are one of the 40 percent of Americans who contribute nothing in the form of taxes.&nbsp; In other words, only society's leeches and bums will profit from an Obama administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Don't be a leech.</p>
