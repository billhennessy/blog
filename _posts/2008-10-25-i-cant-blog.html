    Bill, you've been reading too much Hot Air. This election ain't over yet.  Two weeks before the 2004 election, Kerry held a 53 to 43 percent lead among likely voters in 13 battleground states.  And how'd that one turn out?

    Right now, equal numbers of Dems and Republicans have voted early in Colorado, and I believe a fair number of Colorado Democrats are PUMAs who will end up voting for McCain.  Speaking of PUMAs, did you know that they estimate their own numbers at up to 7 million?  And those same disgruntled Hillary supporters have been deliberately skewing the polls to give Obama false confidence.

    Read HillBuzz, Jim Treacher, Kathryn Jean Lopez at The Corner, and even Ace of Spades HQ, but do yourself a favor and go cold turkey on Hot Air and the rest of the Eeyores.  Even if you have to force yourself, be optimistic for the next 9 days.  We can still win this thing if people like you don't give up!

    You made my day, Jenn.  Thanks.

    Please <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/10/26/the-message/" rel="nofollow">read my latest post</a>.  I decided to try channeling Reagan instead of Dole.

<p>I don't have the heart.&#160; It's too depressing.&#160; The news is that Obama will win in a landslide because Americans have given up on themselves.&#160; They want Obama to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlaw personal retirement savings, <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html" target="_blank">seize all 401k assets</a>, and create new, bigger version of Social Security </li>
<li>Reduce the military by <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html" target="_blank">at least 25 percent</a>, surrendering Afghanistan and Iraq while leaving Eastern Europe and Israel to fend for themselves </li>
<li>Raise taxes on everyone who's not them </li>
<li>Pass draconian Global Warming laws because the people are too stupid to figure out that man-made global warming is a lie </li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on.&#160; Basically, the supposedly middle- to upper-middle-class people who live in my neighborhood are sick of the burden of living and believe socialism will relieve them of all the burdens of adulthood.&#160; </p>
<p>It will.&#160; </p>
<p>And it will take all the pleasures of freedom with it.</p>
<p>My recommendation:&#160; Watch Braveheart tonight with your kids.&#160; Prepare them for the sacrifices that will be required if Obama wins and we ever decide to get our freedom back.&#160; </p>
<p>As <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2006/08/22/point_of_no_return" target="_blank">Thomas Sowell</a> and <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=Nzk5MWY5YjU0MDI0ODFkYTZjMDQ2MjlhZDM0MjAwNTA=" target="_blank">Mark Steyn</a> point out, an election won't undo the socialist wrought by Democrats:&#160; it will take war.&#160; </p>
<p>Sign me up. </p>
