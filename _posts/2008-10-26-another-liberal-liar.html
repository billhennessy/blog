<p>Black Five has the story of cowardly, pussy, scum who's pretending to be a military hero.&#160; I know his kind of talk is frowned upon, but <a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/10/another-fake-so.html" target="_blank">Charlie W. Williams</a> should be taken out and shot.&#160; The best we can hope for in our wimpy society is for a Marine to beat the living hell out of him.&#160; The fact that he's an old man makes no difference:&#160; you pretend to be a war hero for political purposes, you get whatever comes to you.&#160; Whatever whatsoever.&#160; </p>
<p>Then, again, liberalism judges heroics by the costumes. </p>
