<p>Barack Obama's campaign blacklisted WFTV, a Florida television station, because its anchoress, Barbara West, refused to ask Joe Biden the questions prepared and approved by the Obama campaign.&#160; </p>
<p>Barabara West asked Biden hard hitting questions--almost as hard-hitting as questions routinely fired at GOP Vice President candidate Sarah Palin.&#160; At one point, Biden said, "<a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/25/obama-campaign-cuts-interviews-florida-tv-station/" target="_blank">I don't know who's writing your questions</a>," showing his surprised that West was making up questions rather than reading the ones written for her by the Obama campaign.&#160; </p>
<p>Expect Barbara West to be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/10/25/tv.anchor.attack/?iref=mpstoryview" target="_blank">robbed and beaten</a> after Comrade Obama seizes power.&#160; The One doesn't put up with insubordination by the formerly free press. </p>
