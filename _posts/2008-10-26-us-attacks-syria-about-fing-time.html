<p>The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,444101,00.html" target="_blank">US launched an attack</a> against <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/26/report-us-choppers-attack-targets-inside-syria/" target="_blank">terrorists inside Syria</a>, killing at least eight deserving sons of bitches.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ninety percent of foreign fighters enter Iraq through Syria, according to U.S. intelligence estimates. Foreign fighters often enter Iraq in order to bring cash to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/#">Al Qaeda</a> in Iraq's chief. They also are deadly &#8212; trained in bomb-making and willing to sacrifice themselves in suicide attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Syria has permitted terrorists to stage attacks against American in Iraq for five years.&#160; It's about damn time the Bush administration did something about it.&#160; </p>
<p>Target next:&#160; Damascus.</p>
