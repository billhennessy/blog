<p>There are two reasons to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-27/sarah-palins-a-brainiac/1/" target="_blank">read this column</a>, every inch, every delicious letter, comma, period, semi-colon, and sidebar.&#160; </p>
<p>First--</p>
<p>Elaine Lafferty former editor-in-chief of Ms. magazine, has spend a lot of time around Sarah Palin and found her remarkable.&#160; Palin smart and has great . . .&#160; instincts.&#160; </p>
<p>Second--</p>
<p>Read the first comment by an idiot woman named mariah.&#160; Mariah was frightened by Palin's "McCarthy"-like warning that, if Obama is elected, Mariah's property will be in jeopdy. </p>
<p>Does Mariah not read what Obama says?&#160; What does Mariah believe "redistributive justice" means?&#160; What could it possibly mean other than "from each according to his means; to each according to his needs?"</p>
