  content: "First of all, I am not a supporter of Mr. John McCain. Altho I respect
    his service to his country in a war he was not allowed to win, I have no use for
    gigolos and adulterers.\n\nBut this note is about Mr. Barak Obama. The readers
    of this forum are, no doubt, atheists, and, as a true American, I support your
    right to believe whatever religion you want no matter how misguided. But even
    atheists have absorbed some of the teachings of the Bible: \"Where there is smoke
    there is fire\", for instance.\n\nIt is well documented that Mr. Obama was, for
    many years, a member of a \"Christian\" church that preached racism and bigotry.
    It is well documented that Mr. Obama attended an islamic school in his youth and
    has never publicly renounced his muslim upbringing. It is well documented that
    Mr. Obama is versed in the godless communistic teachings of people like Bill Ayers.
    Recent evidence suggests Mr. Obama supports satanism. Polls show that 75% of Jews
    will vote for Mr. Obama. Mr. Obama professes to be from a working class upbringing,
    yet attended an Ivy-league college and vacations in Hawaii. \n\nNow I know that
    \"multiculturalists\" will claim that these are all plusses, but the average American
    wonders, \"Who is this man, what does he really believe?\" Where there is smoke
    there is fire.\n\nI will admit, Mr. Obama is a snappy dresser and an eloquent
    speaker, but so are P.Diddy and Kenya West. I think we would all agree that neither
    of those gentlemen are ready to be the next Commander-In-Chief of this great country.\nMost
    of you are probably too young to remember when Vanilla Ice was scorned and MC
    Hammer was beloved even though their music was interchangeable.\n\nBefore you
    cast your vote, I urge you to think long and hard about the future of your country.
    The choices are not good, an American patriot adulterer or a total unknown.\nMay
    God give you wisdom to do the right thing.\n\nPS: for those who would immediately
    \"knee-jerk flame\" me as a racist, I am not. I dated a colored boy in college,
    even though my parents forbid me to see him. He was a wonderful boy, unfortunately,
    like many of his people he got caught up in drugs and I left him. He still occasionally
    writes me from prison. I also support African children, here is a portion of a
    letter I recently received from one of my \"kids\"-\n\n\"...with your help I will
    continue to be able to afford school supplies. My village was able to dig a new
    well with your help...\" \n\nGod Bless you all, and may He have mercy upon us
    in these trying times."

<p>In an <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/27/smells-like-socialist-spirit/" target="_blank">NPR interview in 2001</a>, Barack Obama admitted that he despises the US Constitution because it limits government. He stated that the Warren Court did not go far enough in redistributing wealth.&nbsp; In essence, the tape confirmed conservatives' worst suspicions of Obama's motives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/10/26/the-message/" target="_blank">I blogged on light side</a>, asking those who support Obama whether or not they're ready to change the US form of government.&nbsp; I tried to make the case that Barack Obama's long associations with admitted communists and terrorists, combined with expected Democrat control of both houses of Congress, placed at risk the idea of self-government, limited in its powers by a Constitution written by the People and enumerating those particular powers that we cede to the government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iivL4c_3pck&w=425&h=344]</p>
<p>Today, we learned that Barack Hussein Obama holds the Constitution in extreme contempt.</p>
<p>In Obama's own words, only 7 years ago:</p>
<p>the Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.</p>
<p>Obama would sever all ties to the Constitution:</p>
<blockquote><p>It didn&rsquo;t break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the Constitution . . .</p>
<p>The Constitution reflected fundamental flaw of this country that continues to this day.</p></blockquote>
<p>A government unrestrained is Obama's goal:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalition of powers through which you bring about redistributive change.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Obama campaign lied, today, denying the tape, claiming it was invented by a conspiracy among Fox News, <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/" target="_blank">Matt Drudge,</a> and John McCain.&nbsp; Here is <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/27/radio-interview-obama-laments-lack-supreme-court-ruling-redistributing-wealth/" target="_blank">false statement from Obama spokesman Bill Burton</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a fake news controversy drummed up by the all too common alliance of FOX News, the Drudge Report and John McCain, who apparently decided to close out his campaign with the same false, desperate attacks that have failed for months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazingly, ALL of the mainstream media refused to carry any aspect of the story.&nbsp; With the way the MSM--The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, LA Times, Washington Post--have repeatedly covered up Obama's communist ties and sentiments, I would not be surprised if Obama has murdered, raped, and imported cocaine.&nbsp; We would never know.</p>
<p>Those of you who still support Obama must accept the title "Fellow Traveler."&nbsp;</p>
<p>*UPDATE* &nbsp;Red Alerts gives McCain t<a href="http://www.red-alerts.com/country-first/mccain-obamas-a-goddamn-communist/" target="_blank">he money line of the campaign</a>. &nbsp;Maybe on Friday.</p>
