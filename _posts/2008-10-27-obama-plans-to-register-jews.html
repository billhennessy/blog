<p>Cleveland, OH -- Citing concern for their safety in an<a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=158218" target="_blank"> increasingly anti-Semitic USA, </a>Democrat presidential candidate Barack Obama today announced a plan to provide Jews with additional protection.</p>
<p>The plan, called "HOPE . . . We'll Protect You," <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">requires</span> urges Jews to register with their local Social Security Administration office.&nbsp; After filling out a short form, SSA will photograph the citizen and implant a small microchip on the Jew's left arm.&nbsp; The chip, about the size of a pencil lead, will allow authorities to quickly identify Jews killed or injured should anti-Semitic violence increase.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obamamideast10apr10,0,1780231,full.story" target="_blank">Our Zionist friends</a> deserve the best protection our government can provide," said the Illinois Senator.&nbsp; "But we can't protect them if we don't know where they are.&nbsp; I think these chips are a wonderful idea, and I can't wait to see how this program gives our Jewish citizens a renewed sense of security.&nbsp; I mean, their government will be watching them 24/7."</p>
<p>Because some Jews may be reluctant to register, the form will also allow volunteers to provide names, addresses, and telephone numbers of their Jewish family and friends.&nbsp; The information will be used only to encourage their friends to register -- for their own protection.</p>
<p>MSNBC News pundit Keith Olbermann hailed the program.&nbsp; "This is the kind of security American Jews have always needed," he said on his nightly program.&nbsp; "With Obama's government watching them, they won't need to worry about what happens to Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Der Juden will always be welcomed here."</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League released a statement in response to Obama's <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">executive</span> <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">order</span> plan:</p>
<p>"While we welcome protection against anti-Semitism, we find Senator Obama's plan unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too . . . fascist."</p>
<p>Next week, Obama plans to announce a similar program to protect conservative bloggers and talk radio hosts.</p>
