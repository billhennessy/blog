<p>The image below from from University of Illinois shows that Arctic Sea ice nearly matches 1980 levels in area, and far exceeds 1980 in concentration.</p>

<p>Remember the AGW crowd's hysteria from this time last year until about June of this year?&nbsp; Scientists predicted that the Arctic would be ice-free?&nbsp; </p>
<p>First, this shows nature's ability to heal itself far exceeds man's ability to heal it.&nbsp; Second, it shows that the AGW crowd are liars.&nbsp; They weren't always.&nbsp; At one time they were simply reporting the facts as they knew them.&nbsp; Then they based predictions on those facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they based prescriptions on those facts.&nbsp; When new facts conflicted with the old predictions, weak men like James Hansen began to lie, saying the new facts, not the old predictions, must be wrong.</p>
<p>Let's look at this date in 2007 verses this date in 2008:</p>
