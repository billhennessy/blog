<p>After a week of steady gains in polling, <a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/hip-hop-store-bribes-youths-to-vote-for.html">McCain is now 1 point ahead</a> of Obama according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zogby.com/main.htm">Zogby</a>.</p>
<p>Some call the Friday poll an anomaly, but there's reason to believe it's not.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/17/operation-destroy-joe-the-plumber/">Joe the Plumber</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/10/27/tito-the-builder-joins-palin-on-the-stump/">Tito the Builder</a> resonate with an increasing number of voters.&nbsp; These are ordinary Americans who work hard to make a better life for their families.&nbsp; Obama and the leftist press attacked them viciously for deigning to challenge the American Lenin's right to ascendancy.&nbsp; For many Americans who prize their freedom, <a target="_blank" href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/31/obama-kicks-dissenting-reporters-off-plane/">Obama's KGB tactics</a> reveal the true nature of the Democrat nominee.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/01/a-cover-up-in-plumbergate/">The Ohio records search</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/31/new-report-ohio-employee-was-ordered-to-snoop-on-joe-the-plumber/">Joe the Plumber</a> freaks people out.&nbsp; What this story reveals is that during an Obama administration, a political challenger will feel the full weight of the government's investigative powers on his shoulders.&nbsp; For Obama and the Democrats, the 4th amendment applies only to abortion.&nbsp; Your political papers are for their use in any way they see fit.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/10/27/obama-admits-hed-replace-the-us-constitution/">Obama's anti-Constitutional</a> musing during a Chicago Public Radio interview reveal a socialist who wants to change America's form of government. </p>
<p>The media's concerted efforts to suppress anti-Obama news is becoming obvious and frightening to more people every day.&nbsp; The <a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/free-tape-protest-at-la-times.html">LA Time tape showing</a> Obama praising a PLO spokesman and professing his belief that "<a target="_blank" href="http://yidwithlid.blogspot.com/2008/10/khalid-al-mansour-is-only-one-of-many.html">Israel has no God-given right to <strike>exist</strike></a> occupy Palestine," has become a symbol of suppression by the press.</p>
<p>Americans realize that <a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/09/15/franklin-raines-criminal-enterprise-and-barack-obama-his-accomplice/#comment-2643">the current financial crisis</a> is the work of Democrats.</p>
<p>These and other stories that relate to <a target="_blank" href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/10/26/the-message/">Obama's anti-Semitism, socialism, and anti-Constitutionalism</a> are undermining his weak support among white blue-collar workers and independents who see themselves as champions of freedom.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's bring down the American Lenin on Tuesday.&nbsp; </p>
