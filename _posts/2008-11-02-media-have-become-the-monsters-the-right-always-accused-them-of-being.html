<p>If you tell a child he's "bad" for long enough, there's a good chance he'll turn out badly.&#160; If you tell the country loudly enough that we're on brink of the worst financial meltdown since The Great Depression, consumer and investor behavior might just bring it on.&#160; After 30 years of us conservatives calling the major media a bunch leftists Marxists seeking to overthrow capitalism through selective burying and publishing of news, we might have expected one day to be right.</p>
<p>Welcome to one day.</p>
<p>In this campaign, some of the most respected news organizations, always left of center, became full-time advocates for one political candidate.&#160; They buried factual and pertinent stories that might have hurt their candidate's chances.&#160; They vilified their candidate's opponent with false stories, often made from whole cloth.&#160; They illegally stole personal information from government computer systems hoping to discredit their candidate's opponents.&#160; They carried out an illegal and uninvestigated internal spying and disinformation campaign that makes Watergate look like a high school prank.</p>
<p>What can be done?&#160; Under the First Amendment, the press have every right to purposely suppress news, just as it has a right to publish legally obtained news.&#160; That's the editorial decision.&#160; But intelligent people will ignore the major media in major ways.&#160; </p>
<ul>
<li>Don't buy newspapers--any newspapers </li>
<li>Don't advertise in newspapers </li>
<li>Don't advertise on television during any news programming of any kind, including local </li>
<li>Don't visit web sites of news organizations that routinely break the law, aid and abet enemy combatants, suppress news that counters their biases, or routinely prints false stories about political opponents.&#160; These corrupt organizations include: </li>
<ul>
<li>AP</li>
<li>Reuters</li>
<li>CNN </li>
<li>MSNBC </li>
<li>NBC </li>
<li>The New York Times </li>
<li>The Washington Post </li>
<li>Los Angeles Times </li>
<li>PBS </li>
</ul>
<li>Don't hire anyone who has previously worked for any of these news organizations or their parent companies (especially General Electric) </li>
</ul>
<p>Simple steps that responsible, patriotic Americans can take every day to help destroy these corrupt organizations.&#160; Have no doubt:&#160; they have each done far crueler things to many, many innocent people. </p>
