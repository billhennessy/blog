    I would like to thank you for saying such nice things about Huckabee. Coming from a dedicated supporter such as me, that means a lot coming from someone who once was harsh of Mike.

    I would like to know why you disagree with Mike on Economics and the Iraq war though?

  content: "You know what, Joseph, I can't even tell you.  On foreign policy, I was
    upset with the op-ed piece he wrote about Iraq.  On economics, I wasn't happy
    with views on some tax issue.  \n\nI have a bad habit of writing what's in my
    Irish heart at the moment, and this is certainly an example.  Were Huckabee like
    me, I'd never have admitted I was wrong.  Perhaps what impresses me most about
    him is that he's brought something good even in a hothead like me.  \n\nThanks,
    so much, for writing."

<p>During the Republican primaries, I went after Mike Huckabee rather harshly. &nbsp;I disagreed with many of his political positions, and I had not seen him perform live.</p>
<p>I still disagree with his views on economics and the war in Iraq. &nbsp;But I've also come under the magic spell he casts on live audiences. &nbsp;(If you haven't witnessed his performance, do it soon. &nbsp;It's absolutely amazing.)</p>
<p>I will state this without any fear of error: &nbsp;Mike Huckabee is a good, good man. &nbsp;I wish I knew him, and I wish he would say something nice about me. &nbsp;Huckabee's the sort of individual whose approval we cherish. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After witnessing McCain's weak performance as a candidate, I can't help but wonder what might have been had Huckabee won the nomination. &nbsp;No one could not like him. &nbsp;The press could not vilify Huckabee without indicting themselves. &nbsp;While McCain was incapable of knocking out Obama, Huckabee might have overwhelmed The One with genuineness--something Obama seems never have experienced.</p>
<p>In the end, we have McCain. &nbsp;But we are fortunate to have met Mike Huckabee. &nbsp;I trust he would never treat me as harshly as I treated him, though I deserve it. &nbsp;I can't imagine a higher compliment.</p>
