<p>In almost every toss-up, battleground state in the country, there remains<a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/11/obamas-lead-shrinks-in-key-state-final.html" target="_blank"> a mass of undecided voters</a> who must decide whether socialism or freedom will prevail. They must make this decision by 7:00 p.m. Tuesday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They better not take it lightly.</p>
<p>If Barack Obama wins, America will no longer be a free country when anyone can grow up to be President or CEO of a company. &nbsp;We know this by Obama's writings and words and those of his Congressional allies. &nbsp;They will cut defense by 25 percent, make treaties with communist and Islamofacist dictators, and create a class of workers dependent upon property stolen from others for their lifestyle. &nbsp;In short, America will cease being American.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would not bet your freedom on a football game, you must vote Republican on November 4. &nbsp;I'm serious about this. &nbsp;A vote for Obama is like betting life in a federal penatentiary on the outcome of a football game. &nbsp;What would your family think of you if you lost? &nbsp;What would you think of yourself? &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not vote, or if you vote for Obama, and Obama wins, you will be responsible for destroying the "last best hope for democracy." &nbsp; You will have sold your grandchildren into slavery for a widescreen television set. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you vote for Obama, you owe the world an apology. &nbsp;You'll owe me and millions of Americans reparations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you vote for Obama, you will lose your freedom.</p>
