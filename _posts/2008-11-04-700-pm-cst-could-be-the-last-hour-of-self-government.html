<p>In the next hour, Obama could win Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, and/or other states.&#160; Any combination of Florida or Pennsylvania, and one of the others will end McCain's chances of winning.&#160; </p>
<p>What's the appropriate song to sing when democracy dies?&#160;&#160; Sam played, "As time goes by" as the Germans marched into Paris.&#160; Maybe that's the song.&#160; </p>
<p>The Germans, by the way, wore gray.&#160; Will Obama wear blue?</p>
<p>UPDATE 7:06:&#160; MSNBC calls <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/04/round-two-pa-fl-and-mo/">Pennsylvania</a> for Obama, but the link is to Hotair because I won't link to the commie bastards at MSNBC.&#160; </p>
<p>UPDATE 7:08:&#160; Fox News calls McConnell to retain his Senate seat in Kentucky, which is a good sign for Republicans.</p>
<p>UPDATE 7:09:&#160; The idiot Elizabeth Dole lost thanks to her idiot ads, according to Fox News.&#160; GOP has lost 2 of 3 open Senate seats.</p>
<p>UPDATE 7:11:&#160; According to <a href="http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/obama-projected-win-pennsylvania">Steve Kornacki</a> (via <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/04/round-two-pa-fl-and-mo/">Allahpundit</a>), Obama needs to flip only one red state worth 11 EVs.&#160; </p>
<p>UPDATE 7:13:&#160; Fox calls New Hampshire for Obama.&#160; The end is near.</p>
<p>UPDATE 7:22: ABC News now calls PA for Obama.&#160; Fox is NOT calling PA because there's no votes counted.&#160; ABC and NBC are basing their projections solely on exit polls.</p>
<p>Note:&#160; FoxNews.com's Flash election map SUCKS</p>
<p>UPDATE 7:25:&#160; Fox News give New Hampshire Senate race to Jeanne Shaheen, taking away Sununu's seat.&#160; Net +3 for Democrats in Senate.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
