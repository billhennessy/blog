<p><strike>Fox New just called Ohio for Obama, meaning McCain is mathematically eliminated. </strike></p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Looks like Obama has won <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/politics/elections/?category=Florida">Florida</a>.&#160; Michigan and Minnesota have gone communist, joining Wisconsin.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Why is Major Garrett interviewing Adolf Hitler?</p>
<p>UPDATE 8:05:&#160; Senate Calls (that matter) John Barrasso (R) wins special election in Wyoming; Mike Enzi (R) wins re-election; Republican Pat Robert wins re-election in Kansas; Tim Johnson (D) wins re-election in SD; Dems pick up Pete Dominici's Senate seat in New Mexico (Dems +4); Jeff Session retains his seat, as does Thad Cochran (both Republicans); the special election for Senate in Mississippi too close to call, but the Republican leads.</p>
<p>UPDATE 8:16:&#160; <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/04/round-three-co-nm/">Allapundit</a> is swinging the towel above his head in preparation for throwing. </p>
<p>Good night, comrades. </p>
