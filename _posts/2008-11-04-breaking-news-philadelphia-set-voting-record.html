<p>Philadelphia, PA-- Philadelphia today saw the most votes cast in the city's history as measured by percentage and raw numbers.&#160; Oddly enough, only about 4,000 people actually showed up at polling places to cast votes.</p>
<p>"It was remarkably efficient," said Philly Mayor Nutter (D).&#160; "We managed to break voting records without forcing people to leave work early or find the polling places.&#160; This is a model for the country."</p>
<p>For the numbers, 127 percent of the eligible voters were represented in the final number, and nearly 1,800,000 votes cast.&#160; </p>
<p>The 4,000 voters were exhausted by the time polls closed.&#160; "The early voting helped a lot," said Malcolm Evers, a 22-year-old man who described himself as a "community organizer."&#160; </p>
<p>Evers and his fellow voters cast all 1.8 million votes.&#160; Since they had filled out the ballots well in advance of election day, today's efforts involved only stuffing the ballots into the slot. </p>
