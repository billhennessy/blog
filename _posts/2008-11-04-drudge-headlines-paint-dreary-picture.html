<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge</a> has posted two headline:&nbsp; Obama + 15 in Pennsylvania (where Black Panthers and election judges made sure no Republicans could actually vote), and SENATE: DEMS SEE 58 SEATS; EXIT POLLS SHOW OBAMA BIG</p>
<p>I wouldn't make too much of it, though.&nbsp; Urban area tend to dump more data at the mid-day collection than suburban and rural areas do.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137451,00.html">Remember that in 2004</a>, the media all but called Ohio for Kerry at 3:00 in the afternoon based on exit poll results.</p>
<p>Nor would I read too much into reports of Obama supporters getting <a target="_blank" href="http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/11/minnesota.php">urgent text messages</a> saying that the race was closer than they expected and directing them to call phone numbers to take part in a last-ditch GOTV effort (h/t <a target="_blank" href="http://hotair.com/">Hotair</a>).&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/11/obamedia-alert-minnesota-significantly.html">The text was probably real</a>, but it was also written and scheduled in Obama's CRM system a month ago.&nbsp; It would have gone out even if McCain had dropped out of the election on Friday.</p>
<p>So, for a little while, America remains a semi-free, quasi democracy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/11/4/pethokoukis-mccain-stocks-soaring.html">McCain</a> pollster positive on Florida, upbeat overall</p>
