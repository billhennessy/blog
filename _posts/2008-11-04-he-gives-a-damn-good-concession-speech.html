<p>Holy crap!&nbsp; That was the best speech McCain ever delivered.&nbsp; It was heartfelt and powerful.&nbsp; It was moving.&nbsp; It was . . . remarkable.</p>
<p>And it reminded me of a great reason to celebrate.&nbsp; Let me explain.</p>
<p>I was born in 1963 when there were still "Colored" and "White" drinking fountains.&nbsp; Obama's a few years older. </p>
<p>Tonight, despite my best efforts and many others, we have a black President.&nbsp; That's amazing in a very good way.</p>
<p>If there's a silver lining in this election, it's this:&nbsp; America is now a color-blind society.&nbsp; Martin Luther King must be smiling, not for Obama's election, but for America's maturity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>God bless America.</p>
