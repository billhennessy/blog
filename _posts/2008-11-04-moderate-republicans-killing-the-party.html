  content: I would argue that if McCain had stuck with his moderate views that he
    held earlier in his career, as opposed to adopting many of Bush's more conservative
    views, he would have had a much better chance of winning tonight. I think people
    such as Noonan, if anything, help the GOP. Newsy.com had a good featuring Noonan
    yesterday.

  content: "Peggy Noonan, who I once adored, has a nasty habit of encouraging a course
    of action, then condemning it once it's taken.  (She turned on Reagan and on Bush
    after they took actions she'd previously promoted.) \n\nMcCain could not win this
    election without the conservative base.  Fence-straddlers may vote, but they don't
    pay.  Without the right, a Republican candidate has no money with which to campaign.\n\nFinally,
    given the choice between a true-blue Democrat and a Republican cross-dressing
    as a Democrat, people will choose the real thing.  Candidate of either party who
    pretend to be of other party lose.  Thompson could not have beaten Obama, but
    neither could have Huckabee.  And Thompson would have raised more money."

<p>It should be clear by now, but I figured I'd point it out:&#160; Idiots like the editors of National Review, Christopher Buckley, and Peggy Noonan need to retire.&#160; Republican moderates, including McCain, are getting their rear-ends kicked, and they're taking self-government with them.</p>
<p>The only way to defeat leftism is with hard core conservatism.&#160; </p>
<p>The debate is over. </p>
