  content: "I called an audible at the store and went with single malt Scotch.  \n\nEvery
    election since 1988, I would select a Scotch to drink (and, until I gave them
    up, a Don Diego Lonsdale cigar).  Because of the enormity of this loss, both in
    scale and in scope, I was thinking about going with my South St. Louis roots and
    drinking the product from Lynch and Pestalozi Streets.\n\nIn the end, we on the
    right are all about tradition.  So this one lives on.  Next election, the Scotch
    will taste much sweeter when we re-take the Senate and close the gap in the House.
    \  \n\nTwo-thousand ten, I drink a toast to thee!"

<p>Sober, I scratch out some ideas for recovery.</p>
<ol>
<li>The conservative movement must forget the Republican party.&nbsp; If the GOP wants to come along with us, they're welcome.&nbsp; But we won't listen to their nonsense about "<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/02/05/why-vote-republican/" target="_blank">big tents</a>" and "get over Reagan."&nbsp; The Republican party was an irresponsible steward of conservatism for the past 20 years.&nbsp; Tonight it got its just deserts.&nbsp; Too bad the rest of us have to endure re-education camps, economic depression, and malaise because of them.&nbsp; We'll run as Republicans, but the morons who orchestrated this abortion better not even think about telling us how to do it.</li>
<li>The movement needs an intellectual nexus.&nbsp; Buckley, Kirk, and Friedman are gone, and their replacements are pygmies.&nbsp; Perhaps Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams can fill the role.&nbsp; Perhaps the third is Rush Limbaugh.&nbsp; (Don't laugh--he's forgotten more about political philosophy than the entire staff of National Review ever knew.)</li>
<li>We need a new journal of opinion.&nbsp; The Weekly Standard is Hollywood; National Review is overrun with wimps and cowards; the others lack seriousness. A new magazine, backed with billions, could inspire a new generation.</li>
<li>We must target teachers' unions and education. CORRECTION: [<em>I copied portions of this from a draft I never posted, for good reason, and copied the wrong damn paragraph at that. </em>]&nbsp; The NEA has a stated purpose of gaining complete control of US Federal legislation.&nbsp; It has protected teachers who, without parental permission, require kindergartners to sign Gay Pledge cards; teachers who place communist "social justice" indoctrination above actual education; teachers who intentionally undermine the authority of parents.&nbsp; Conservatism must view these people as <em>bad</em> teachers.&nbsp; The way to remove them is to destroy the NEA's financial ability to defend them.</li>
<li>Stop spending.&nbsp; Hoard your money like a miser.&nbsp; We have no reason to support the American economy.</li>
<li>Identify one fresh, conservative candidate for US House and Senate NOW and push them. (One candidate in each state, of course.&nbsp; That's 50 gains in the House and 10 gains in the Senate, considering the rotation.)</li>
<li>Potential candidates need to put the movement before themselves.&nbsp; No more fights to the death only to tear apart the certain winner.</li>
<li>Be nice.&nbsp; This will be very difficult for me, but I'll try if you will.&nbsp; More Reagan will help.</li>
<li>Read "Democracy in America" and "The Conservative Manifesto."&nbsp; One predicts what happened; the other prepares the recovery.</li>
<li>Have a drink.&nbsp; I have to run to the store for six pack.</li>
</ol>
<p>Domnus vobiscum, and God bless America.</p>
