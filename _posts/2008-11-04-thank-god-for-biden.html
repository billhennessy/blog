<p>My mother told me to always find the good in a bad situation.&#160; </p>
<p>If Obama wins, we'll have 4 years of knee-slapping, chin-rattling, crisis-causing gaffes from the silliest candidate for high office since . . . Quayle? </p>
<p>In today's episode, <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/11/03/biden-offers-girls/" target="_blank">Joe explains</a> than Nancy-girls could kick Nancy-boys' asses.&#160; Or something like that. Well, no, his sister's a "girl-boy" and girl-boys are tougher than girl . . .</p>
<p>Screw it.&#160;&#160; I have no idea what he was trying to say, but I'd defend with my laugh his right to say it!</p>
