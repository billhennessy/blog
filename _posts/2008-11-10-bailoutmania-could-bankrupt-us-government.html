<p>Once responsible companies are now basing decision critical decisions on government handouts.&#160; This is this is an expected, but unplanned for, result of the Paulson's Panic in September. Says the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rescue efforts are "evolving in ways that I don't think anyone anticipated," said Camden Fine, president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade group. "Things are just hitting them from every single direction, every day, and I don't think they know whether to spit or go blind."</p>

From WSJ.com:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, mortgage giant Fannie Mae said it is losing money so rapidly it may need a cash infusion from the Treasury Department by year's end. The funds would come from a special $100 billion pool Treasury set aside back in September to aid the company. Fannie Mae had a loss of $29 billion for the third quarter.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122630276296413267.html?mod=testMod#printMode" target="_blank">money, though, is running out</a>.&#160; Expect US Treasuries to be downgraded before Obama takes the oath.&#160; </p>
<p>Then we'll be in a world of hurt.</p>
