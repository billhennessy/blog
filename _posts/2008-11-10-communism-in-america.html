  content: "The guy was arrested for yanking his arm away from the cops. Yes it is
    ticky tack, but they can do it. I saw an arrest at a UT game of a girl who did
    the same thing, only she was j-walking. He was not arrested for the shirt. It
    seems like Republicans are playing themselves up as victims yet walk right into
    the fist. I never thought I'd say this to a conservative but....GROW UP. \nThe
    quote should be credited to Gibson's screen writer. Not William Wallace."

<p>I've received some notes and e-mails from friends who say I'm overboard in my rhetoric about Obama's potential to communize the USA.&#160; I respect them, but they're simply wrong.&#160; </p>
<p>In Philadelphia, you can be arrested simply for wearing McCain-Palin t-shirts, as proven in <a href="http://www.red-alerts.com/un-american-activities/the-future-of-america/" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
<p>And these are Philly's finest, not Obama's promised jack-booted thugs. </p>
<p>Be vigilant, America.&#160; Sleep with one eye open.&#160; Remember the words of William Wallace in the movie <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/11/09/its-movie-time-for-conservatives/" target="_blank">Braveheart</a>:</p>
<p><em>Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you&#8217;ll live&#8230; at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin&#8217; to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they&#8217;ll never take&#8230; OUR FREEDOM!</em></p>
