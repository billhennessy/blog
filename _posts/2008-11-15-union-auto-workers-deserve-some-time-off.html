<p>A federal bailout for the Big Three auto manufacturers will be direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the upper class.&nbsp; Auto workers are, by Joe Biden's definition, "wealthy."</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/07/uaw-pricing-themselves-out-of-market.html">Union auto workers</a> more than the average executive manager with an MBA and nearly 3 times the wage of the average teacher with a master's degree.&nbsp; That's why the Big 3 are dying, and that's exactly what the unions deserve. (Hat tip, <a target="_blank" href="http://econopundit.com/">Econopundit</a>)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/">Gateway Pundit provides</a> this chart showing the extravagant auto worker salaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>American auto workers make almost 160 percent of Japanese auto workers wages.&nbsp; And the Japanese produce better cars.&nbsp; </p>
<p>UAW's time has passed.&nbsp; Big Union's greed has destroyed more jobs in America than anything that's happened on Wall Street.&nbsp; Let's let the UAW workers eat cake for a while.</p>
