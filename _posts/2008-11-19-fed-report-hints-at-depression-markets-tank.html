<p>The Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee released the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/fomcminutes20081029.pdf" target="_blank">minutes</a> of its October 28-29 meeting, today, in which some members raise the specter of economic depression extending more than 4 consecutive quarters.&#160; The report calls the present financial mess the worst in more than half a century, carefully avoiding direct references to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94I6CF00&amp;show_article=1" target="_blank">the Great Depression</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stocks Tank</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94I822O0&amp;show_article=1" target="_blank">Wall Street responded</a> with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/fomcminutes20081029.pdf" target="_blank">427 point (5.16 percent) collapse</a>, with Citigroup leading financial stocks to a 10 percent crash.&#160; Citigroup lost 25 percent of its value today.</p>
<p>Most economists consider a <a href="http://useconomy.about.com/od/grossdomesticproduct/f/Depression.htm" target="_blank">depression</a> more than 1 year of negative GDP growth.&#160; The last depression in the United States was the Great Depression of 1930 through 1942.&#160; Only increased wartime production ended that economic chaos.</p>
<p><strong>Fed Has Been Overly Optimistic</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/fomcminutes20081029.pdf" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> (subscription required) notes that in recent meetings, the Fed has underestimated the economy's weaknesses, which could mean unemployment, bankruptcies, and negative growth could get far worse than today's report suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fed downgraded its previous expectations for GDP growth for 2008&#160; after significantly over-estimating 2008 growth in its August meeting </li>
<li>The Fed downgraded its 2009 growth estimate from greater than 2 percent to -0.2 to 1 percent </li>
<li>The Fed raised it unemployment forecast to 6.5 percent, even though unemployment is already above 6.5.&#160; In August, they predicted 5.5 to 5.7 percent unemployment </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/19/great-news-dow-crumbles-again-closes-below-8000/" target="_blank">Allahpundit has a poll</a> asking where the market will stand on 1/1/2009.&#160; I picked 6,000-6,999.&#160; I expect the DJIA to reach and hold 6,900 by Demember through mid-2010, trading in a range of +400 to -200 points.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/11/obama-stock-market-nosedive-continues.html" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> notes that this is the largest post-election sell-off in history.</p>
