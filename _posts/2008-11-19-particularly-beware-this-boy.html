<p>It turns out, according to a Zogby poll to be released in its entirety today, that most <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/18/video-how-obama-got-elected/" target="_blank">Obama voters are woefully, frighteningly, and unforgivably ignorant</a> of the basic facts of government and of Barack Obama himself.&#160; Not surprising.&#160; Dickens warned us of the dangers of ignorance in "<a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/DicChri.html" target="_blank">A Christmas Carol</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>Suddenly, Scrooge noticed something strange about the ghost. Two children-like figures were at the ghost&#8217;s feet &#8211; a boy and a girl. But, they looked old and dreadful, like little monsters. Scrooge was shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirit, are they your creatures?&#8221; Scrooge asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are Man&#8217;s creatures,&#8221; said the spirit &#8220;The boy is Ignorance. The girl is Want. Beware them both, but most of all beware this boy&#8221; said the spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither our schools--Kindergarten through Ph.D.--nor our press is fit to properly inform and educate voters.&#160;&#160; Both institutions are partisans.&#160; Schools, for the most part, promote socialism and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS291&amp;q=schools+teach+anti-americanism&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">anti-Americanism</a>.&#160; They dumb down kids, teach to the least capable, and eschew the values that once defined an American:&#160; individualism, competition, and excellence.&#160; The press is, well, the press.&#160; </p>
<p>The other culprit here is high voter turnout.&#160; Since the most educated and informed voters tend to vote every election (about 30 percent), the math requires that the higher the turnout, the more ignorant the average voter.&#160; Since Democrats appeal disproportionately to uninformed people, it makes sense that Obama captured the clueless vote.&#160; </p>
<p>Expect to see a lot of bumper stickers that read "Don't Blame Me--What's Vote?"</p>
