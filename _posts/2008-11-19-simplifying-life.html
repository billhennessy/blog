<p>After the tumult of the election, 2 years of college, and the financial meltdown, I've had it with hectic.&nbsp; At least, I've had it with hectic that I don't control in some way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Searching for ideas (motivation, actually) to simply my life, I came across ZenHabits.net run by Leo Babauta.&nbsp; I highly recommend this site to anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the content is a little new age, but it's digestible.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=56260&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=41653" target="ejejcsingle"><img src="http://zenhabits.net/fotos/ztd.png" alt="" width="156" height="172" align="left" /></a>Along the way, I've bought his ebook, "Zen to Done."&nbsp; Inspired by David Allen's great personal management book, "Getting Things Done," ZTD takes the concept to a simpler and more practical level. ( <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=56260&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=41653" target="ejejcsingle">Click here to view more details</a>)</p>
<p>Leo's system is simple:&nbsp; reduce all of your action commitments or ideas to paper (or its electronic equal) and do them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, that's an over simplification.&nbsp; We all know that's what we should do.&nbsp; The problems are manifold:</p>
<ul>
<li>We forget when we need to remember</li>
<li>We remember at the wrong time (like when we're trying to fall asleep)</li>
<li>We feel anxious because of the nagging feeling that we should be doing something else</li>
<li>We react instead of responding</li>
<li>We put off decisions which leaves us feeling weak and disorganized</li>
<li>We can't find the stuff we need when we need it</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to a great personal management system, Leo gives an effective crash course on building positive habits.&nbsp; This, in my view, makes the book worth the $9.50 price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conservatives need to let go of some things.&nbsp; Zen is about focusing on the essentials, after stripping away the Eastern religion stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" target="_blank">blog</a>,<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=56260&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=41653" target="ejejcsingle">buy the book</a>.&nbsp; You'll thank Leo.</p>
