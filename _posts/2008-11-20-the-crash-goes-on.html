<p>Today's economic reads as though Dean Koontz decided to write a financial horror novel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment claims hit multi-decadal high</li>
<li>Citi <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122722907151946371.html?mod=testMod" target="_blank">looking at selling itself</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/11/20/guest-post-markets-test-us-resolve/" target="_blank">Deflation Certain</a>--the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8b5f0d60-b743-11dd-8e01-0000779fd18c.html" target="_blank">"malign" kind</a></li>
<li>Stocks plumment 5 percent for second straight day</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500 hits levels last seen when <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/gm-ford-worries-drag-futures-lower/" target="_blank">Princess Di was alive</a></li>
<li>American <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081120/congress_autos.html" target="_blank">auto industry</a> facing <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,455407,00.html" target="_blank">extinction</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It sound apocalyptic.&#160; <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/expert/article/yourlife/122582;_ylt=Ai2vi0Kq9wpYo5rwAlEcxvW7YWsA" target="_blank">Financially, it could be</a>.&#160; Two stalwarts of the American national economy lived too long on ancient practices:&#160; autos and finance.&#160; </p>
<p>Consider this from <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8b5f0d60-b743-11dd-8e01-0000779fd18c.html" target="_blank">Financial Times of London</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For some time it has not been a question of whether we will see deflation but if it will be the benign kind, where lower commodity prices boost consumption, or a malign spiral of falling prices pushing up the value of debt,&#8221; said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. &#8220;Today&#8217;s figures all point to the malign variety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some short-term US Treasury bills were quoted below zero per cent. Two-year bond yields at one point fell to 0.96 per cent, the lowest since the two-year note was created in 1976. Yields on the 30-year bond fell to a record low of 3.71 per cent.</p>

<p><strong>Democrats Replaying 1932</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Congressional Democrats and the incoming Obama administration seem willing to let the country go down in flames, as Roosevelt did from election day 1932 until his swearing in April, 1933.&#160; During that time, banks were closing at the rate of several a day which was causing irrational panic in businesses, markets, and the public.&#160; People were thrown out of work on speculation.&#160; Hoover begged Roosevelt to endorse a banking holiday to allow people to compose themselves.&#160; The arrogant Democrat ignored the President's pleas.&#160; </p>
<p>Roosevelt wanted the problem to fester.&#160; He wanted the crash to turn into a nightmarish carnival of economic mayhem: the greater the turmoil, the more easily Americans would accept his socialist plans for them.</p>
<p>After taking office, of course, Roosevelt announced a bank holiday to the cheers of millions.&#160; He didn't mention that the holiday was Hoover's idea, nor that he could have endorsed the concept in November, saving millions of jobs and countless lives from the Great Depression that followed.</p>
<p>Today's Democrats are playing cat and mouse with the auto industry.&#160; If they would simply let GM file BK, much of the auto industry's problems would resolve themselves.&#160; As Romney pointed out, without bankruptcy, the industry will not reform.&#160; And the last person we need approving that reformation is <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94ISTF80&amp;show_article=1" target="_blank">Nancy Pelosi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>If the markets continue to dive on Friday, President Bush will have to ask the exchanges to close next week.&#160; Thursday is a&#160; holiday, anyway.&#160; Make it a 5-day market break to quell the panic currently rising throughout the world.&#160; </p>
<p>The president should also tell Congress to ***** or get off the pot vis-a-vis the auto bailout.&#160; A positive indication against government intervention would&#160; allow the GM board to fire the arrogant and incompetent Waggoner and hire a CEO capable of rearchitecting the industry.&#160; A bailout will prolong the inevitable, and vacillation will doom the US auto sector completely.</p>
