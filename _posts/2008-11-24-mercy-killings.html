<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gm-to-close-windsor.jpg"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="244" alt="gm_to_close_windsor" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gm-to-close-windsor-thumb.jpg" width="244" border="0" /></a> Let's hope that this weeks sees Congress and Barack's team come to their collective senses about bailouts.</p>
<p>Government intervention in the private problems afflicting General Motors, Chrysler, and the finance business effective reward poor leadership.&#160; Leaving executive compensation off the table completely, the government should foster a healthy climate for business, but no more.</p>
<p>General Motors is not too big to fail; it's too proud to do the right thing.&#160; Wise liberals, like <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/what-to-do-abou.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>, and conservatives, like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html?ex=1384837200&amp;en=3616fe7f95dd6a7b&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg" target="_blank">Mitt Romney</a>, agree that the best thing for the GM, for the American economy, and for the government is to let GM file for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy forces GM to reorganize itself into a viable business, which it currently is not.&#160; Bankruptcy forces all of the US car makers and the UAW to restructure union contracts that reflect modern realities instead of childlike nostalgia.&#160; Finally, bankruptcy is the only way to ensure that the financial accommodations are sufficient to fix GM's problems long term. </p>
<p>The same principles apply to Chrysler and, possibly, to Ford.&#160; I concentrate on GM because its CEO is the most boisterous in telling us that it our duty to save his job.&#160; No dice.&#160; Our duty is to help save his company from him. </p>
<p>P.S.&#160; Seth Godin hints that <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/watching-the-ti.html" target="_blank">the NY Times</a> needs to restructure as certainly as GM does. And don't miss <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/watching-the-ti.html" target="_blank">this sobering commentary</a> in the Financial Times of London (h/t <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/23/quotes-of-the-day-41/" target="_blank">Allahpundit</a>)</p>
