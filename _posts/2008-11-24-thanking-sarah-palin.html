<p>I received this e-mail this morning and thought I'd share it.&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to update you on the media reports regarding the <a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/2644819:3175717592:m:1:119121196:C271CA0DF6BD9215DA4FC91A6B7FD8EA">Our Country Deserves Better Committee's</a> "Thank You Sarah Palin" television ad campaign that launches this week.&#160; Both CNN and CNN International contacted us for interviews on the subject.&#160; The Wall Street Journal ran an online report as did the publication Advertising Age.&#160; MSNBC is conducting an interview with our spokesman, Mark Williams, on Monday morning.</p>
<p>MSNBC already televised one segment discussing our ad campaign, which we will show you below.</p>
<p>Before we do, we wanted to let you know we need to raise just $50,000 more to fund our TV ad buy to thank Gov. Sarah Palin and defend her from all the attacks that continue to be launched against her.&#160; It's obvious our efforts are striking a nerve, and those who are afraid of Palin's appeal to America are determined to smear and destroy her.&#160; We must fight back in honor of this dynamic, uplifting and passionate conservative leader.</p>
<p>You can help by making a contribution of $25, $50, $100, or $500.&#160; Some of you will be able to afford a larger contribution of $1,000, $2,500 or $5,000.&#160; Whatever you can afford we thank you for your support!&#160; You can donate online - <a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/2644820:3175717592:m:1:119121196:C271CA0DF6BD9215DA4FC91A6B7FD8EA">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>And now we present to you the MSNBC television report that aired last week about this upcoming pro-Palin tv ad campaign:</p>
<p><a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/2644821:3175717592:m:1:119121196:C271CA0DF6BD9215DA4FC91A6B7FD8EA">Watch MSNBC on Pro-Palin Ad Campaign - HERE</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commercials seem wholly positive and thankful, not angry; exuding happiness is one of the key behavioral changes conservatives MUST MAKE if we're to return to power in the United States.&#160; </font></p>
<p>I am not affiliated with the group in any way, but I like their message.&#160; </p>
