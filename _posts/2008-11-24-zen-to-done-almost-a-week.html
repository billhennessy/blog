<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ra100998.jpg"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="113" alt="RA100998" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ra100998-thumb.jpg" width="170" border="0" /></a> This morning I felt no compulsion to get back in bad after turning off the alarm at 5:00.&#160; I must be getting used to the practice. </p>
<p>I have been about 90 percent on writing down (Jotting) every commitment that comes into my world.&#160; Oddly, the ones I'm most likely to overlook are the most obvious and visible duties.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Ignoring the Big Rocks</strong></p>
<p>For example, today my boss asked me to kick off a project that I'd been asking to do for some time.&#160; That was about 9:00 this morning.&#160; I didn't Jott it until 2:00 p.m.&#160; In between, I Jotted at least half a dozen tiny little tasks, like updating a blog entry and shifting ownership of an email distribution list I no longer manage. </p>
<p>I suspect that I'm willing to hold onto the big projects because I trust they'll have obvious ticklers to alert me that I need to work on them.&#160; That's a dangerous assumption. Another project, which comes due on December 4, is STILL not in Jott, nor are any of the tasks associated with it.&#160; My memory has proven insufficient on this project, as I'm now scrambling to tie up several loose ends.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Learned</strong></p>
<p>The lesson is here is simple:&#160; Take care of the Big Rocks; they're no more likely to take care of themselves than are the little pebbles. </p>
