<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cyberterror.jpg"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="138" alt="cyberterror" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cyberterror-thumb.jpg" width="95" border="0" /></a> The Internet--the engine that drove year-over-year increases in sales since its inception--is unable to overcome the economic malaise in America.</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first 23 days of November, online sales declined 4% to $8.2 billion from $8.5 billion the same time last year, according to market-research firm comScore Inc. The firm projects that retail spending online in the months of November and December will total $29.2 billion, flat from the same period last year -- a dreary sign for online retailers, many of which had grown accustomed to double-digit gains.</p>
<p>The figures follow numbers from October, when online sales grew only 1% versus a year earlier.</p>
<p>"The decline that we're seeing is unprecedented," said Andrew Lipsman, a senior manager at comScore. [<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122764819199157439.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That fact is frightening to people who thought that e-commerce would continue to grow despite a deep and prolonged recession (including me).</p>
<p>While I've documented scores of bad news and chilling predictions, something about this story strikes a particular nerve.&#160; Perhaps it's because I've made my living pushing the web since 1997.&#160; </p>
