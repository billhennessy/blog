<p>Is <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/28/asia/28mumbai.php" target="_blank">Mumbai</a> a test run for an attack on the United States?</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mumbai550.jpg"><img style="border-width:0;" height="135" alt="mumbai550" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mumbai550-thumb.jpg" width="244" border="0" /></a> Al Qaeda is out of practice.&#160; The terror organization has been quite since 2001, pinned down inside in Iraq where our heroes destroyed their efforts to establish a beach head. </p>
<p>The coincidence of the horror in Mumbai with the FBI reports of a serious, legitimate threat to the NYC subway system seems coordinated to me.&#160; </p>
<p>Since 9-11, the US, UK, and Israel have trained and developed anti-terrorism techniques jointly with many nations, including India.&#160; The joint terrorism training provides all nations with new insights and better coordination.&#160; For instance, India and Israel have dealt with Islamofascism longer and more directly than the US.&#160; They can provide us with tactics and maneuvers that we'd never have developed on our own--absent long, bloody attacks from Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>If bin Laden were planning ground invasion of the US, he would want to anticipate the American response and tactics.&#160; The Mumbai operation--handled, it seems--deftly by the Indian NSG--provides terrorists with the American game plan.&#160; </p>
<p>Was this what Joe Biden meant when he said Obama would be tested hard?&#160; Would Obama respond as decisively as India has?&#160; Or would he negotiate with the terrorists as they systematically murdered their hostages?&#160; </p>
<p>You asked for it, America.&#160; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; <a href="http://arunshanbhag.com/2008/11/27/mumbai-blasts-day-2/" target="_blank">Minutes-old photos</a> of commando drops onto roof of Jewish center.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Reports are a Rabbi and his wife have been killed.&#160; <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23mumbai" target="_blank">Reports from Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Ed Morrissey also noticed that the <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/26/massive-terror-plot-in-mumbai-80-dead-250-injured/" target="_blank">coincidence is ominous</a>.&#160; </p>
