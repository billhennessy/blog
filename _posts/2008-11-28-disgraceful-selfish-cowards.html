<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/flag-distress.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="188" alt="Flag_Distress" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/flag-distress-thumb.png" width="205" align="left" border="0" /></a> Liberal America is a sub-species of selfish cowards.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,458564,00.html" target="_blank">India suffered its own 9-11</a> over the past 3 days.&#160; It continues at this hour.&#160; Yet America's government, its media, its pundits retreated under the cover of Thanksgiving and the excuse of saving their corrupt and incompetent friends on Wall Street and in Detroit.&#160;&#160; George Bush and Barack Obama are invisible.&#160; CNN and MSNBC refused to call the terrorists who murdered over 160 in cold blood anything stronger than "militants."&#160; </p>
<p>In New Jersey, a throng of selfish, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html" target="_blank">money-grubbing Main Streeters</a> killed an old man in Wal-Mart in order to get an HDTV at 30 percent off.&#160; The cowardly President and his cowardly relief are silent. </p>
<p>You, Liberal-American, you are a disgrace to your heritage, to your history, to your parents and grandparents.&#160; You are weak and cowardly.&#160; You would hide behind a child to save your own worthless hide.&#160; Indians die in the streets, and you stuff your pie hole with overcooked turkey.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,458644,00.html" target="_blank">The Muslim murderers</a> are marching across England, France, and Germany, and you drink bottled water and fret over global temperatures.&#160; A <a href="http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/773691/jewish/Mumbai-Jewish-Family-Killed.htm" target="_blank">sweet, meek Rabbi</a> and his wife are bound, gagged, and shot in the head while you rushed into a Best Buy for a camcorder.&#160; Will you use it film the Rabbi's baby, Moses?&#160;&#160; And to whom would you show the footage.&#160;&#160; Do you think your fellow American gives a rat's ass about a Jewish orphan?</p>
<p>So, Merry Christmas to the disarmed, green, selfish wimps.&#160;&#160; They are the face of America.&#160; They are the next victim in the Muslim wave that threatens 5,000 years of civilization's advance.&#160; They are obsequious, spineless scum who pass you every day in the mall.&#160; </p>
<p>Look in the mirror, watch a John Wayne movie or Brave Heart or The Patriot this long weekend.&#160; Lock yourself in your bathroom for a couple of hours and weep bitterly.&#160;&#160; You have betrayed your birthright, your heritage, and your brother.&#160; Your children should be ashamed to have sprung from your loins.&#160; </p>
<p>But it's not too late.&#160; There is time.&#160; Little, but some.&#160; What happened in Mumbai was practice for New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis.&#160; They are coming, and it's us or them.&#160; There will be only one victor. </p>
<p>*UPDATE*&#160; I've thought enough about this.&#160; It's time to nuke the Western provinces of Pakistan.&#160; It's time to let one of our fine Trident submarine crews to release the fury of 24 MIRVed SLBMs on an enemy that will not relent until it's vaporized.</p>
<p>Let the vaporization begin.&#160;&#160; </p>
