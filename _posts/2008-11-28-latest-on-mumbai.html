  content: "Thursday, Nov. 27, 2008\nIndia's Muslims in Crisis \nBy Aryn Baker\n \nhttp://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1862650,00.html?cnn=yes\n
    \nThe disembodied voice was chilling in its rage. A gunman, holed up in the Oberoi
    Trident hotel in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), where some 40 people had been taken
    hostage, told an Indian news channel that the attacks were revenge for the persecution
    of Muslims in India. \"We love this as our country, but when our mothers and sisters
    were being killed, where was everybody?\" he asked via telephone. No answer came.
    But then he probably wasn't expecting one.\n \nThe roots of Muslim rage run deep
    in India, nourished by a long-held sense of injustice over what many Indian Muslims
    believe is institutionalized discrimination against the country's largest minority
    group. The disparities between Muslims, who make up 13.4% of the population, and
    India's Hindus, who hover at around 80%, are striking. There are exceptions, of
    course, but generally speaking, Muslim Indians have shorter life spans, worse
    health, lower literacy levels and lower-paying jobs. Add to that toxic brew the
    lingering resentment over 2002's anti-Muslim riots in the state of Gujarat. The
    riots, instigated by Hindu nationalists, killed some 2,000 people, most of them
    Muslims. To this day, few of the perpetrators have been convicted. \n \nThe huge
    gap between Muslims and Hindus will continue to haunt India's &mdash; and neighboring
    Pakistan's &mdash; progress toward peace and prosperity. But before intercommunal
    relations can improve, there are even bigger problems that must first be worked
    out: the schism in subcontinental Islam and the religion's place and role in modern
    India and Pakistan. It is a crisis 150 years in the making.\n \nThe Beginning
    of the Problem \n\nOn the afternoon of March 29, 1857, Mangal Pandey, a handsome,
    mustachioed soldier in the East India Company's native regiment, attacked his
    British lieutenant. His hanging a week later sparked a subcontinental revolt known
    to Indians as the first war of independence and to the British as the Sepoy Mutiny.
    Retribution was swift, and though Pandey was a Hindu, it was the subcontinent's
    Muslims, whose Mughal King nominally held power in Delhi, who bore the brunt of
    British rage. The remnants of the Mughal Empire were dismantled, and 500 years
    of Muslim supremacy on the subcontinent came to a halt. \n \nMuslim society in
    India collapsed. The British imposed English as the official language. The impact
    was cataclysmic. Muslims went from near 100% literacy to 20% within a half-century.
    The country's educated Muslim &eacute;lite was effectively blocked from administrative
    jobs in the government. Between 1858 and 1878, only 57 out of 3,100 graduates
    of Calcutta University &mdash; then the center of South Asian education &mdash;
    were Muslims. While discrimination by both Hindus and the British played a role,
    it was as if the whole of Muslim society had retreated to lick its collective
    wounds. \n \nOut of this period of introspection, two rival movements emerged
    to foster an Islamic ascendancy. Revivalist groups blamed the collapse of their
    empire on a society that had strayed too far from the teachings of the Koran.
    They promoted a return to a purer form of Islam, modeled on the life of the Prophet
    Muhammad. Others embraced the modern ways of their new rulers, seeking Muslim
    advancement through the pursuit of Western sciences, culture and law. From these
    movements two great Islamic institutions were born: Darul Uloom Deoband in northern
    India, rivaled only by Al Azhar University in Cairo for its teaching of Islam,
    and Aligarh Muslim University, a secular institution that promoted Muslim culture,
    philosophy and languages but left religion to the mosque. These two schools embody
    the fundamental split that continues to divide Islam in the subcontinent today.
    \"You could say that Deoband and Aligarh are husband and wife, born from the same
    historical events,\" says Adil Siddiqui, information coordinator for Deoband.
    \"But they live at daggers drawn.\" \n \nThe campus at Deoband is only a three-hour
    drive from New Delhi through the modern megasuburb of Noida. Strip malls and monster
    shopping complexes have consumed many of the mango groves that once framed the
    road to Deoband, but the contemporary world stops at the gate. The courtyards
    are packed with bearded young men wearing long, collared shirts and white caps.
    The air thrums with the voices of hundreds of students reciting the Koran from
    open-door classrooms. \n \nFounded in 1866, the Deoband school quickly set itself
    apart from other traditional madrasahs, which were usually based in the home of
    the village mosque's prayer leader. Deoband's founders, a group of Muslim scholars
    from New Delhi, instituted a regimented system of classrooms, coursework, texts
    and exams. Instruction is in Urdu, Persian and Arabic, and the curriculum closely
    follows the teachings of the 18th century Indian Islamic scholar Mullah Nizamuddin
    Sehalvi. Graduates go on to study at Cairo's Al Azhar or the Islamic University
    of Medina in Saudi Arabia, or they found their own Deobandi institutions. \n \nToday,
    more than 9,000 Deobandi madrasahs are scattered throughout India, Afghanistan
    and Pakistan, most infamously the Dara-ul-Uloom Haqaniya Akora Khattak, near Peshawar,
    Pakistan, where Mullah Mohammed Omar and several other leaders of Afghanistan's
    Taliban first tasted a life lived in accordance with Shari'a. Siddiqui visibly
    stiffens when those names are brought up. They have become synonymous with Islamic
    radicalism, and Siddiqui is careful to dissociate his institution from those who
    carry on its traditions, without actually condemning their actions. \"Our books
    are being taught there,\" he says. \"They have the same system and rules. But
    if someone is following the path of terrorism, it is because of local compulsions
    and local politics.\" \n \nSir Syed Ahmad Khan, who founded the Anglo-Mohammedan
    Oriental College at Aligarh in 1877, studied under the same teachers as the founders
    of Deoband. But he believed that the downfall of India's Muslims was due to their
    unwillingness to embrace modern ways. He decoupled religion from education and
    in his school sought to emulate the culture and training of India's new colonial
    masters. Islamic culture was part of the curriculum, but so were the latest advances
    in sciences, medicine and Western philosophy. The medium was English, the better
    to prepare students for civil-service jobs. He called his school the Oxford of
    the East. In architecture alone, the campus lives up to that name. A euphoric
    blend of clock towers, crenellated battlements, Mughal arches, domes and the staid
    red brick of Victorian institutions that only India's enthusiastic embrace of
    all things European could produce, the central campus of Aligarh today is haven
    to a diverse crowd of male and female, Hindu and Muslim students. Its law and
    medicine schools are among the top-ranked in India, but so are its arts faculty
    and Quranic Studies Centre. \"With all this diversity, language, culture, secularism
    was the only way to go forward as a nation,\" says Aligarh's vice chancellor,
    P.K. Abdul Azis. \"It was the new religion.\" \n \nThis fracture in religious
    doctrine &mdash; whether Islam should embrace the modern or revert to its fundamental
    origins &mdash; between two schools less than a day's donkey ride apart when they
    were founded, was barely remarked upon at the time. But over the course of the
    next 100 years, that tiny crack would split Islam into two warring ideologies
    with repercussions that reverberate around the world to this day. Before the split
    became a crisis, however, the founders of the Deoband and Aligarh universities
    shared the common goal of an independent India. Pedagogical leanings were overlooked
    as students and staff of both institutions joined with Hindus across the subcontinent
    to remove the yoke of colonial rule in the early decades of the 20th century.
    \n \nTwo Faiths, Two Nations \n\nBut nationalistic trends were pulling at the
    fragile alliance, and India began to splinter along ethnic and religious lines.
    Following World War I, a populist Muslim poet-philosopher by the name of Muhammad
    Iqbal framed the Islamic zeitgeist when he questioned the position of minority
    Muslims in a future, independent India. The solution, Iqbal proposed, was an independent
    state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India, a separate country
    where Muslims would rule themselves. The idea of Pakistan was born. \nMohammed
    Ali Jinnah, the Savile Row&ndash;suited lawyer who midwifed Pakistan into existence
    on Aug. 14, 1947, was notoriously ambiguous about how he envisioned the country
    once it became an independent state. Both he and Iqbal, who were friends until
    the poet's death in 1938, had repeatedly stated their dream for a \"modern, moderate
    and very enlightened Pakistan,\" says Sharifuddin Pirzada, Jinnah's personal secretary.
    Jinnah's own wish was that the Pakistani people, as members of a new, modern and
    democratic nation, would decide the country's direction. \n \nBut rarely in Pakistan's
    history have its people lived Jinnah's vision of a modern Muslim democracy. Only
    three times in its 62-year history has Pakistan seen a peaceful, democratic transition
    of power. With four disparate provinces, more than a dozen languages and dialects,
    and powerful neighbors, the country's leaders &mdash; be they Presidents, Prime
    Ministers or army chiefs &mdash; have been forced to knit the nation together
    with the only thing Pakistanis have in common: religion. \n \nFollowing the 1971
    civil war, when East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, broke away, the populist Prime
    Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto embarked on a Muslim-identity program to prevent
    the country from fracturing further. General Mohammed Zia ul-Haq continued the
    Islamization campaign when he overthrew Bhutto in 1977, hoping to garner favor
    with the religious parties, the only constituency available to a military dictator.
    He instituted Shari'a courts, made blasphemy illegal and established laws that
    punished fornicators with lashes and held that rape victims could be convicted
    of adultery. When the Soviet Union invaded neighboring Afghanistan in December
    1979, Pakistan was already poised for its own Islamic revolution. \n \nAlmost
    overnight, thousands of refugees poured over the border into Pakistan. Camps mushroomed,
    and so did madrasahs. Ostensibly created to educate the refugees, they provided
    the ideal recruiting ground for a new breed of soldier: mujahedin, or holy warriors,
    trained to vanquish the infidel invaders in America's proxy war with the Soviet
    Union. Thousands of Pakistanis joined fellow Muslims from across the world to
    fight the Soviets. As far away as Karachi, high school kids started wearing \"jihadi
    jackets,\" the pocketed vests popular with the mujahedin. Says Hamid Gul, then
    head of the Pakistan intelligence agency charged with arming and training the
    mujahedin: \"In the 1980s, the world watched the people of Afghanistan stand up
    to tyranny, oppression and slavery. The spirit of jihad was rekindled, and it
    gave a new vision to the youth of Pakistan.\"\n \nBut jihad, as it is described
    in the Koran, does not end merely with political gain. It ends in a perfect Islamic
    state. The West's, and Pakistan's, cynical resurrection of something so profoundly
    powerful and complex unleashed a force that gave root to al-Qaeda's rage, the
    Taliban's dream of an Islamic utopia in Afghanistan, and in the dozens of radical
    Islamic groups rapidly replicating themselves in India and around the world today.
    \"The promise of jihad was never fulfilled,\" says Gul. \"Is it any wonder the
    fighting continues to this day?\" Religion may have been used to unite Pakistan,
    but it is also tearing it apart. \n \nIndia Today \n\nIn India, Islam is, in contrast,
    the other &mdash; purged by the British, denigrated by the Hindu right, mistrusted
    by the majority, marginalized by society. There are nearly as many Muslims in
    India as in all of Pakistan, but in a nation of more than a billion, they are
    still a minority, with all the burdens that minorities anywhere carry. Government
    surveys show that Muslims live shorter, poorer and unhealthier lives than Hindus
    and are often excluded from the better jobs. To be sure, there are Muslim success
    stories in the booming economy. Azim Premji, the founder of the outsourcing giant
    Wipro, is one of the richest individuals in India. But for many Muslims, the inequality
    of the boom has reinforced their exclusion. \n \nKashmir, a Muslim-dominated state
    whose fate had been left undecided in the chaos that led up to partition, remains
    a suppurating wound in India's Muslim psyche. As the cause of three wars between
    India and Pakistan &mdash; one of which nearly went nuclear in 1999 &mdash; Kashmir
    has become a symbol of profound injustice to Indian Muslims, who believe that
    their government cares little for Kashmir's claim of independence &mdash; which
    is based upon a 1948 U.N. resolution promising a plebiscite to determine the Kashmiri
    people's future. That frustration has spilled into the rest of India in the form
    of several devastating terrorist attacks that have made Indian Muslims both perpetrators
    and victims. \n \nA mounting sense of persecution, fueled by the government's
    seeming reluctance to address the brutal anti-Muslim riots that killed more than
    2,000 in the state of Gujarat in 2002, has aided the cause of homegrown militant
    groups. They include the banned Student Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), which
    was accused of detonating nine bombs in Mumbai during the course of 2003, killing
    close to 80. The 2006 terrorist attacks on the Mumbai commuter-rail system that
    killed 183 people were also blamed on SIMI as well as the pro-Kashmir Pakistani
    terrorist group Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT). Those incidents exposed the all-too-common
    Hindu belief that Muslims aren't really Indian. \"LeT, SIMI &mdash; it doesn't
    matter who was behind these attacks. They are all children of [Pervez] Musharraf,\"
    sneered Manish Shah, a Mumbai resident who lost his best friend in the explosions,
    referring to the then President of Pakistan. In India, unlike Pakistan, Islam
    does not unify but divide. \n \nStill, many South Asian Muslims insist Islam is
    the one and only force that can bring the subcontinent together and return it
    to pre-eminence as a single whole. \"We [Muslims] were the legal rulers of India,
    and in 1857 the British took that away from us,\" says Tarik Jan, a gentle-mannered
    scholar at Islamabad's Institute of Policy Studies. \"In 1947 they should have
    given that back to the Muslims.\" Jan is no militant, but he pines for the golden
    era of the Mughal period in the 1700s and has a fervent desire to see India, Pakistan
    and Bangladesh reunited under Islamic rule. \n \nThat sense of injustice is at
    the root of Muslim identity today. It has permeated every aspect of society and
    forms the basis of rising Islamic radicalism on the subcontinent. \"People are
    hungry for justice,\" says Ahmed Rashid, a Pakistani journalist and author of
    the new book Descent into Chaos. \"It is perceived to be the fundamental promise
    of the Koran.\" These twin phenomena &mdash; the longing many Muslims feel to
    see their religion restored as the subcontinent's core, and the marks of both
    piety and extremism Islam bears &mdash; reflect the lack of strong political and
    civic institutions in the region for people to have faith in. If the subcontinent's
    governments can't provide those institutions, then terrorists like the Trident's
    mysterious caller will continue asking questions. And providing their own answers.

<p>According to <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=1027878869&amp;page=1&amp;q=mumbai" target="_blank">Tweeters</a> in the streets of Mumbai outside Nariman House, the Jewish Center, NSG Commandos (Indian special forces) are high-fiving people in the streets.&#160; The crowds are singing patriot songs.&#160; No gunfire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 30 or more bodies were found in the Oberoi hotel.</p>
<p>I hope the West takes a lesson from NSG's fierce, straight-on attack on the terrorists.&#160; </p>
<p>Also, have you noticed that our Western, pro-terrorist media (CNN, NY Times, LA Times, MSNBC) refuse to call the Mumbai terrorists "terrorists?"&#160; The MSM calls them "militants." </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160;&#160; New reports of explosions and fire inside the Taj.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com/node/9310" target="_blank">conspiracy theorists</a> are claiming the Mossad and CIA, not Muslim terrorists, behind the bloody siege.&#160;&#160; Well, not JUST conspiracy theorists--some white supremist whack job. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; 7:22 CST:&#160; One terrorist remains in Taj Hotel in the Crystal Ballroom.&#160; Up to 15 hostage remain in the Taj.&#160;&#160; Follow live feed from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7754676.stm" target="_blank">BBC here</a>, but there's no audio. Better--<a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/video/video_live.aspx?id=0" target="_blank">NDTV Live</a>.&#160; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/flashLive/live.html?stream=stream2" target="_blank">CNN-IBN Live</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Other news on Nariman House:&#160; Five hostages have been killed. Terrorists still alive have advanced to the 3rd floor of Nariman from the first floor. <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/28/asia/28mumbai-cnd.php" target="_blank">More news on IHT</a>.</p>
<p>It must kill CNN executives that the IBN (Indian) commentators insist on calling the terrorists what they are.&#160; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Hundreds of civilians are celebrating INSIDE Nariman House even though terrorists remain on the 3rd floor.&#160; Reports indicate that the revelers are unaware that commando operations are still underway inside the building.&#160; Yikes. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122782332649762273.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal article</a> discusses challenges Obama will face in bringing to stability to Central Asia.&#160; Again and again, the flow of events disrupt Obama's Hope and Change agenda.&#160; Between the economic crisis and terrorism, Iran and Venezuela, China and North Korea, Obama will have very little operating room for the next 2-3 years.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Seems BBC has confirmed that Mumbai terrorists include Pakistan-born British citizens.&#160; </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; 7:52 CST:&#160; Operation in Nariman could be over soon.&#160; Commandos are combing the 3rd floor looking for any remaining terrorists.&#160; The dead bodies--5 hostages and 2 terrorists--are on the 2nd floor of Nariman.&#160; Authorities unable to remove or identify the bodies.</p>
<p>In India, recriminations over the security failures that allowed this to happen.&#160; Sounds as though Indian security was too worried by Hindu terrorism and took its eyes off of the Muslims--the principle forces of evil in the world today.&#160; The West better take this as a lesson:&#160; Terrorism comes from Islam and from other, less organized forces.&#160; We can't fight them all at once.&#160; Keep the focus on Islamic terrorism until that scourge is obliterated. </p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; 8:03 CST:&#160; From a <a href="http://india.targetgenx.com/2008/11/28/hail-the-spirit-of-mumbai/" target="_blank">blogger in India</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the <strong>Spirit of Mumbai </strong>has once again <em>&#8220;defeated&#8221;</em> the motive of terrorists to create painic. Even after 41 hours of the attack, the battle is still going on at Trident Hotel and Nariman House (28th November, 15:00 hrs IST) but Mumbai woke to the morning of the 27th with the same spirit as it has always.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people of India, of Mumbai, should be proud of themselves.&#160; The world should be proud of them.&#160; </p>
