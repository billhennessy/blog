<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/alg-walmart-police.jpg"><img style="border-width:0;" height="169" alt="alg_walmart_police" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/alg-walmart-police-thumb.jpg" width="260" align="left" border="0" /></a> Say you're the CEO of Wal-Mart.&#160; You get a report from your store in Valley Stream, NJ, that one of your employees was <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html" target="_blank">trampled to death</a> by your customers who broke down the doors to get at your Black Friday specials before anyone else.&#160; In the chaos, a customer, 8-months pregnant, suffered a miscarriage.&#160; </p>
<p>How would you respond?</p>
<p>Suppose you were the police who responded?&#160; How would you handle the situation in which the crowd, gripped by throes of a shopping frenzy refused to allow first responders to attempt to save the man's life?&#160; Not that they had anything against 43-year-old Jdimytai Damour, the victim; it's just that he picked a really inconvenient spot to die.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'd have closed that store and all other Wal-Marts in the US immediately.&#160; Pay the employees, but close the doors for the weekend.&#160; Forget Black Friday and its narrow margins and high volumes. </p>
<p>Perhaps you'd announced the end to Black Friday panic sales.&#160;&#160; Go back to your everyday low price policy.&#160; </p>
<p>Perhaps you'd do nothing.&#160; After all, the customers want super cheap bargains, and the customer is king. </p>
<p>Suppose you're the police.&#160; Maybe you'd handle this situation like a riot, seal the store, and process every customer inside as a participant in manslaughter.&#160; </p>
<p>With all the talk of an <a href="http://boomerconsumerbook.blogspot.com/2008/10/here-come-simplifiers.html" target="_blank">end to excess consumption</a>, this sad story indicates something else entirely.&#160; It indicates that many Americans are so obsessed by consumption that they'll kill anyone who gets in their way.&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>"When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, 'I've been on line since Friday morning!'" <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Kimberly+Cribbs">Cribbs</a> said. "They kept shopping." [<a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-limart1129,0,7044659,print.story" target="_blank">source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ed Morrissey points out that this murderous mayhem occurred in preparation for <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/28/the-black-friday-mindless-stampede/" target="_blank">the coming of Christ</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>This Christmas, let's take <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/holiday-shoppin.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin's advice</a>:&#160; shop small, shop quality, shop local, shop handmade.&#160; Let's be satisfied with a single gift instead of measuring our happiness by the number of packages we open.&#160; If you can't bring yourself to do this the name of God, perhaps you can do it in the name of Jdimytai Damour.&#160; Or of the unborn baby--less than one month from birth--who gave his life so that someone could get an HDTV for 30 percent off the already low, low price.&#160; </p>
