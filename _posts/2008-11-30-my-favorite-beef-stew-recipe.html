<p>With our first snowfall of the season, it's time for stew.&#160; I created this recipe over a couple of years.&#160; It seems, finally, ready to release.&#160; Get your pens and shopping lists.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 lbs. stew beef chopped in 1" to 1.5" cubes</li>
<li>Tone's Canadian Steak Seasoning (do not attempt this recipe without it)</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
<li>2 tbs olive oil</li>
<li>16 oz. can beef bullion(or 2 cups water, 2 bullion cubes)</li>
<li>28 oz. can whole tomatoes in tomato juice </li>
<li>12-16 new red potatoes (whole with skin firmly in place)</li>
<li>4 - 6 celery stalks, chopped into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
<li>8-12 green onions, chopped into 1 inch pieces (stems, too)</li>
<li>4-6 fresh carrots, skinned, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
<li>6-10 stalks fresh cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
<li>3 tbs flour (for thickening)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Sprinkle the Tone's Canadian Steak Seasoning mix over the meat, toss, and set aside.&#160; (Be careful not to use too much seasoning or the stew will be too salty.)</p>
<p>In large frying pan with lid, saut&#233; the garlic over medium-high heat for 1 minute.&#160; Add the meat and stir fry, almost on high, until meat is uniformly browned. Add beef broth (or water and cubes), cover, and simmer for 2.5-3 hours.</p>
<p>Transfer this amazing-smelling stew to a large stew pot with lid.&#160; Add canned tomatoes, celery, carrots, green onions, cilantro leaves, potatoes.&#160; Increase heat to medium-high to induce light boiling.&#160; Return heat to simmer, cover, and read a book for 1.5 hours.</p>
<p>Before serving, mix flour with ice cold water to form a loose paste.&#160; Gradually stir the paste into the stew, cover for 5 minutes, serve.</p>
<p>Serves 6-8.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>You can use the cheap scraps many stores sell as stew meat, but you might want to invest in a slightly better grade of beef.&#160; I prefer fresh organic vegetables except for the tomatoes.&#160; The green onions and cilantro do something that regular onions cannot. </p>
<p>I like the beef to literally shred in the juices.&#160; If you want chunks of beef, cut the beef simmer time to 1.5-2 hours. </p>
