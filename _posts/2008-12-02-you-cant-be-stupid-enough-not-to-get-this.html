  content: What a loss for our country that Fred Thompson wasn't the GOP candidate
    in the general election. If he was, releasing a few videos like this during the
    initial bailout hearings would have gone a long way toward making the conservative
    approach to economics popular again.  I really hope this video means Fred intends
    to stay active in American politics.

    the nation?
