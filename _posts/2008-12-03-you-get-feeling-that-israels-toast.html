<p>Barack Obama has a lot of friends who would like to see a Final Solution to the Middle East, if you get my drift.&#160; <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=17653" target="_blank">Samantha Power</a>, for instance, told the Institute for Policy Studies (which was founded by the KGB during the Cold War) that the US should invade Israel and set up a puppet government to impose a suicidal deal with Hamas. Nice, huh?</p>
<p>Add to that a mounting certainty that Iran will deploy a nuclear weapon by the end of 2009--a year Obama must devote almost solely to the economy.&#160; The "experts"&#160; advise Obama to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5275647.ece" target="_blank">negotiate directly with Iran</a>.&#160; To what end, we don't know.&#160; We do know Iran's intent:&#160; wipe Israel off the face of the earth. </p>
<p><strong>Possible US Goals</strong></p>
<p>In talks with a nuclear Iran, the Obama administration has two possible ends:&#160; a) Iran's unilateral nuclear disarmament; or b) Iran's sincere, heartfelt promise never to use their nuclear weapons irresponsibly.</p>
<p>Asking Iran to give up the most powerful weapon in the world would be like asking a monkey to give up a banana.&#160; "Give me the banana."&#160; "Raaaaaach!"&#160; The concept might sound nice to the Polyannas, but it Disney World would still win a reality contest.</p>
<p>Option (b) would effectively condone Iran's pursuit and development of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>But what would Obama <em>offer</em> to Iran in exchange for . . . . whatever?&#160; Isn't negotiation about one side conceding something to the other side?&#160; So what does Iran want so badly that it would give up its most effective tool to secure?&#160; </p>
<p>Iran has oil and the money that comes with it.&#160;&#160; Unlike North Korea, Iranians are not starving and living in huts.&#160; Iran has friends in the region, again in contrast to North Korea.&#160; Except for attention and "respect," the US has nothing to offer Iran.&#160;&#160; And only the bomb garners America's attention and feigned respect.</p>
<p>Oh, and one other thing America has too offer:&#160; Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Abandoning Our Most Faithful Ally</strong></p>
<p>Just as Neville Chamberlain surrendered a quarter of Europe to Hitler in exchange for peace in his time, Obama could obtain from Iran an illusory peace by offering to turn his back on Israel. </p>
