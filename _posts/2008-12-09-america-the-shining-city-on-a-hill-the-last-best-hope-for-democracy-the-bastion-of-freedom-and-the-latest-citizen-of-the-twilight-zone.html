<p><a href="http://drudgereport.com"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/nationalization.jpg" alt="Nationalization" width="244" height="159" border="0" /></a> Would you believe me if I told you that capitalism would end in America, not by government seizure, but by surrender of the capitalists themselves?&nbsp; Are we really witnessing our largest businesses asking the government to save them from themselves?</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday that Ronald Reagan rolled back the advancing tide of socialism.&nbsp; He began the unraveling of complex and burdensome federal regulations that seemed designed to make free enterprise unmanageable.&nbsp; With our help and Margaret Thatcher's, Reagan restored a sense of duty and purpose in the world.&nbsp; He lowered taxes, rebuilt the military, stopped the Soviet Union in its expansionist tracks, and put the swagger back into our national stride.</p>
<p>Just 20 years after Reagan rode off into the sunset, the stewards of the free enterprise engine have thrown up their hands and cried "uncle."&nbsp; One by one--some days 2 by 4--the foundations of free market capitalism and the symbols of financial independence and growth surrender to the socialism monster in Washington.&nbsp; It's like an episode of the Twilight Zone.</p>
<p>The government now runs the banks.&nbsp; It will soon <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/">seize the automobile</a> and steel industries.&nbsp; <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/12/hah-ny-times-hocks-building-bushies.html">Newspapers are just behind</a>.&nbsp; At that point, every major purchase you make and every word of news you read will be designed, assembled, packaged, filtered, and sold by a bureaucrat in Washington.</p>
<p>Instead of freedom, we are given license.&nbsp; Society, mainstream protestant churches, the media, and government tell us to do whatever we want with the allowance we're given.&nbsp; There is no such thing as consequence or shame.&nbsp; Humility has become a pathology just when we, as a nation and as individuals, have infinite reasons to be humble.</p>
<p>God gave man the right to run his own life;&nbsp; we said, "no, thank you."</p>
