<p>Apparently Bush's plan to socialize all of America before leaving the White House is alive and well. &nbsp;Some sort of a <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=7444&amp;url=/Chicago-Magazine/February-2008/Mr-Un-Popularity/&amp;mode=print">crappy deal has been reached</a>.</p>
<p>The plan includes a car czar--something that Toyata, Nissan, and Honda miraculously do not need--to run the auto industry like a DMV license office. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time a government designed, built, and sold an automobile like, it was called the Yugo. &nbsp;I'll keep my SUV, thanks.</p>
<p>Once again, our <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/09/yes-more-voices-for-a-gop-filibuster-of-the-uaw-bailout/">last hope is the Republican Caucus</a>--this time in the Senate. &nbsp;Write today.</p>
