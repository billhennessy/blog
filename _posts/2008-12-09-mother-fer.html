<p>Wow.&nbsp; Why does news like this always break when I'm at work?</p>
<p>Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich did the perp walk for his Chicago neighbors this morning.&nbsp; Others have written plenty about the facts of the indictment (<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/12/09/feds-arrest-illinois-gov-blagojevich-for-trying-to-sell-obamas-vacant-senate-seat/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/12/source-feds-take-gov-blagojevich-into-custody.html">here</a>, <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/12/09/obama-i-never-talked-to-blagojevich-about-the-senate-seat-axelrod-yes-he-did/">here</a>, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/09/corruptocrat-alert-blagojevich-taken-into-custody-by-fbi-conspired-to-selltrade-hhs-position-stifle-newspaper/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16392.html">here</a>).&nbsp; You should know two things:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There's a chance Obama will pardon Blagojevich before he goes to court.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because Obama is too close not to.&nbsp; Blagojevich is NOT AN HONORABLE CROOK.&nbsp; He will throw Obama under in a heartbeat.&nbsp; With the Justice Department expanding the Rezko-Obama land scandal investigation, with two of Obama's closest associates (Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod) and Obama himself having served as paid adviser's to Blagojevich , the risks to the new administration are too great to allow the governor to go to trial. &nbsp;UPDATE: John Kass, writing in the Trib, wonders if <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-kass-blago-extradec09,0,6988635.column">Blago will sing</a> for reduced charges. &nbsp;Told you<a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=N2M4NDM2MDhlZTA4MTBjZjRhYmRjYTc1ZWY1MzExZDE="> this would get interesting</a>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The indictments were timed to precede Obama's inauguration.&nbsp; This indictment would have been buried, the tapes destroyed, had Obama's justice department learned of the scope of the corruption.&nbsp; Fitzgerald had to move before the transition team learned that the FBI had the goods on Obama's buddy.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; This whole episode is a great lesson in how Democrat politics works.&nbsp; Blagojevich was using the power of the state purse to control the news coming out of the Chicago Tribune, to funnel money from a children's hospital into his own pocket, and to control a labor union.&nbsp; This is Democrat at its best.&nbsp; The only difference between Chicago Democrats and the others is that the Chicago breed are too stupid to cover their tracks.</p>
<p>This should be the most interesting story in the news for the next month.&nbsp; If Obama pardon's Blagojevich , look for the GOP to take back the House in 2010.</p>
<p>**UPDATE** David Axelrod previously <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16395.html">endorsed trading political appointments for cash</a> in a 2005 Chicago Tribune Op-Ed. &nbsp;Obama's circle of corrupt friends gets more disturbing by the minute: &nbsp;Axelrod, Baglojevich, Franklin Raines (who danced around Congress today), Rev. Wright, Tony Rezko . . . who am I missing?</p>
<p>**UPDATE** The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-chicago-tribune-editorial-1209,0,2702166.story">Chicago Tribune's Wednesday editorial is up online.</a> &nbsp;It's brief and reveals nothing new, but it's worth reading, nonetheless. &nbsp;The sheer ballsiness of Blagojevich is astonishing. &nbsp;The stupidity, if portrayed in a work of fiction, would render the script amateurish. &nbsp;What were you people thinking when you voted for this idiot? &nbsp;And what does it say of <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=7444&amp;url=/Chicago-Magazine/February-2008/Mr-Un-Popularity/&amp;mode=print">Obama's vaunted judgment</a> that he campaigned for and worked for the most ineptly corrupt politician in the history of America's most corrupt city and state? &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2008/12/staggering-allegations-even-by-illinois-standards.html">Staggering </a>is an understatement.</p>
