<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://laborpains.org/2008/12/12/22-pounds-uaw-rules-and-regulations/">United Auto Workers</a> is the sort of extortion racket that gives crime a bad name.&nbsp; For 40 years--since the introduction of Japanese cars in the US market--these <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Angry-UAW-members-lash-out-at-apf-13823458.html">whining, overpaid slobs</a> have bilked consumers for billions, insisting that they deserve to be overpaid simply because there's a bunch of them.&nbsp; America would be better off if the UAW simply ceased to exist.&nbsp; </p>
<p>They make the bogus claim that they are better workers than their non-union counterparts who assemble BMWs, Hondas, Nissans, and Toyotas.&nbsp; Yet none of their customers agree.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now I'm a loyal US car buyer, believe it or not.&nbsp; My last 4 cars, in order, were Jeep, Chevy, Ford, and Mercury.&nbsp; I've bought one Nissan (which was a great car, but tiny), and a used Mazda (which I still miss but 160,000 miles was enough).&nbsp; I want the US auto industry to flourish.</p>
<p>That's why I pray Bush keeps his hands out of the TARP funds, which I also opposed.&nbsp; Let the bad companies take their lumps in bankruptcy court.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To succeed in bankruptcy, though, everyone involved has to take a hit.&nbsp; Owner value falls to zero.&nbsp; Lenders (bond holders, suppliers, vendors) take pennies on the dollar.&nbsp; Cities and states give up their kickbacks from idled plants.&nbsp; Dealerships go out of business.&nbsp; Most of all, the overpaid, under worked UAW members take a pay cut to bring them into line with most Americans.&nbsp; And the retired grifters deal with retirement like everyone else; they don't go on make as much as they made when they worked every day. </p>
<p>The US auto industry's wage and tax system is unsustainable.&nbsp; Billions of tax dollars will not fix it.&nbsp; Only the legal protection of bankruptcy supervised by a brilliant business mind (I nominate Mitt Romney) will give GM and Chrysler a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even then, it's only a chance.&nbsp; </p>
