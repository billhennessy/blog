    Did you catch the video from this week of Al Gore telling a German audience that the entire North Pole will be gone within five years?

<p>The massive storm brewing out west will plunge <a target="_blank" href="http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/USCA0638?from=monthAvgGraph_topnav_undeclared">Los Angeles</a> into the 30s, threatening all-time record lows for that city.&nbsp; Seattle is looking at highs in the mid-20s for the week ahead.&nbsp; That's cold.&nbsp; Amazingly, the Ottawa Weather Center predicted this blast last week (<a target="_blank" href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/09/rare-50-year-arctic-blast-sets-sights-on-southern-california/">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.owsweather.com/ows.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to the east and north or Southern California, blizzards will extend from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.weather.com/maps/maptype/forecastsusnational/ussnowfallforecast_large.html?from=36hr_winterstrmwarn">New Mexico to Minneapolis</a>.&nbsp; The cold and snow is forecast to continue for the next 48-72 hours, striking St. Louis and Chicago Sunday evening through Tuesday.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This weather comes from Siberia where daily highs have been -80 F for the past few days. Apparently, there's not much CO2 in Russia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the AGW freaks insist that Congress take over the auto industry to save the planet.&nbsp; I assume they want to save the planet from another ice age.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/13/something-is-rotten-in-norway-500000-sq-km-of-sea-ice-disappears-overnight/#more-4514">Anthony Watts</a> has discovered more fraud by the global warming nuts, this time involving Arctic sea ice.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><p>This morning I was shocked to discover that overnight, huge amounts of sea ice simply disappeared. Fortunately I had saved the images and a copy of the webpage last night. Here is the before and after in a blink comparator:</p>

<p>The criminals at <a target="_blank" href="http://arctic-roos.org/observations/satellite-data/sea-ice/ice-area-and-extent-in-arctic">NANSEN</a> didn't like the fact that Arctic sea ice was about to exceed the 1979-2000 average.&nbsp; So they changed the numbers.&nbsp; What a bunch of lying criminals.&nbsp; Here's the e-mail address of the criminal master mind: <a href="mailto:stein.sandven@nersc.no">stein.sandven@nersc.no</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp; take a look at yesterday's satellite images of the North Pole and judge for yourself.&nbsp; On the right is yesterday's ice.&nbsp; On the left is 12/12/1980, one of the coldest winters in the past 40 years.&nbsp; </p>
