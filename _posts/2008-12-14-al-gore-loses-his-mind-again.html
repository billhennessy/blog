<p><a href="http://www.jennqpublic.com/">Jenn Q Public</a> asked <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/12/13/historic-winter-storm/">if I'd heard t</a>hat Al Gore--the man Don Imus described as Evil Incarnate--told a German audience that the North Pole will cease to exist in 5 years.&#160; He held up his hand, fingers splayed, to avoid any possible confusion.</p>

<p>Mark the date:&#160; according to Gore, on 12/12/2013, there will be zero ice north of the Arctic Circle.&#160; This would an amazing change in trends since global sea ice has been <a href="http://noconsensus.wordpress.com/2008/12/14/glolbal-sea-ice-increased-over-28-years/">growing for 20 years now</a>.&#160; (h/t <a href="http://tomnelson.blogspot.com/2008/12/glolbal-sea-ice-increased-over-28-years.html">Tom Nelson</a>)</p>
<p>If he's wrong, let's sue him.&#160; Here's how.&#160; We'll set up a PayPal account to raise money to build a Jet Ski resort in Barrow, Alaska.&#160; The big bucks&#160; will to R&amp;D of the lighting system to allow people to Jet Ski during months with zero sunlight.&#160; </p>
<p>If there's ice in January, that will seriously hurt business.&#160; Since we based our business on a guarantee from Gore, he'll be liable for our loses.&#160; We'll sue him, not only for our lost investment, for 20 years of revenue.&#160; </p>
<p>Of course, if Al Gore is not a liar and a fraud, he could always sue me.&#160; </p>
