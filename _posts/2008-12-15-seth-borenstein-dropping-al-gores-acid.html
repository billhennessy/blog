<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2008/12/14/time-running-obama-curb-global-warming/">Seth Borenstein</a> seems to have <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/12/14/al-gore-loses-his-mind-again/">dropped the same Global Warming LSD as Al Gore</a>. </p>
<p>Today, in a news article (not opinion, mind you) Borenstein claims that the 10-year <a href="http://www.dailynewscaster.com/2008/12/14/seth-borenstein-aps-science-writer-says-cooling-trend-actually-illustrates-how-fast-the-world-is-warming/">cooling trend we're in proves the seriousness of his personal brand of Global Warming</a>. He also passes along flat out lies about temperatures and, especially, sea ice extent--making up facts that never existed. Borenstein is a terrible polemicist and lazy researcher.</p>
<p>But Borenstein excels as a writer.&#160; One can actually hear the chaffing of his palms upon each other has he simultaneously types and wrings his hands. That's like three kinds of exceptional talent.</p>
<p>Like so many on the freak side of AGW, Borenstein makes two errors:</p>
<p>He believes that climate history began in 1860.</p>
<p>He believes that James Hansen is an honest broker.</p>
<p>Both beliefs require the naivet&#233; of an innocent child in whom they'd be charming.&#160; In the AP's science writer, they seem as they are:&#160; malignant ignorance. </p>
