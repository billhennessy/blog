<p>Today's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122926660096904673.html">Wall Street Journal</a> directly contradict's Barack Obama's claim to have never discussed his Senate replacement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barack Obama had begun thinking about his Senate successor even before the presidential election, and dispatched <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/12/pressure-mounts-on-emanuel-to-resign.html">Rahm Emanuel</a> days after the vote to contact aides of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to begin talking up Mr. Obama's preferred candidates, associates of Mr. Emanuel said this weekend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that Obama also claimed that no one on his staff or acting on his behalf discussed the seat with Blago.&#160; </p>
<p>Clearly, Barack <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/12/14/video-new-rnc-ad-hammers-obama-over-blagojevich/">Obama is caught, now, in an major lie</a>.&#160; He has lied to the public about matters material to a felony.&#160; Of course, he's been lying since his <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1189687/posts">2004 convention speech</a>, and no one seems to care.</p>
<p>This is the danger when you elect a president who has never done anything in his life except writing autobiographies:&#160; he doesn't know what to do!</p>
<p>The upside is that the GOP could steal Obama's Senate seat in a special election, as all potential Democrat candidates are <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&amp;sid=awCu8_Lyd8oo&amp;refer=home">tainted</a> by Blagojevich's felony charges.&#160; While one seat is one seat, taking the president-elect's seat would be particularly sweet. </p>
