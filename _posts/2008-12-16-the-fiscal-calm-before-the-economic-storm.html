<p>New York, Illinois, California, and a dozen other liberal states will raise taxes dramatically in the next 3 months.&#160; New York, for instance, is instituting <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/12/16/2008-12-16_gov_david_paterson_unveils_dire_new_york.html">88 new taxes</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>OPEC will cut oil output until oil reaches their target of $75 to $90 a barrel, which equates to $2.30 to $2.80 gasoline.</p>
<p>Obama will impose regulations and taxes that stifle growth.</p>
<p>The Bush capitulation to the Unamerican Auto Workers thugs will allow Detroit to limp for several months before collapsing.</p>
<p>Things will look okay for a few months.&#160; The DJIA will rise to about 9,800 by late January, though much volatility will remain.&#160; Then the bottom will fall out in March or April.</p>
<p>Look back to 1929-1930, 1979-1981.&#160; Both times, the economy began to recover before the big collapse.&#160; But this collapse will be bigger because the government is just about out of options.&#160; </p>
<p>The US government's credit-worthiness has to be suspect.&#160; No one want's .25% T-Bills.&#160; No one wants to invest in an organization that's increasing its debt by $8 trillion every 90 days, as the US government has been since September.&#160; The government is almost out of the borrowing business.&#160; It will have to massively inflate currency to run.</p>
<p>Buy necessitates.&#160; If you must invest, Hormel, makers of Spam, is your best bet. </p>
