<p>Anthony Watts runs <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/">one of the most fascinating web sites</a> on the entire internet.&#160; If you don't read it every day, you're missing a great, free education. </p>
<p>Two stories today illustrate his Nobel-worthy work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-ionosphere-drops-to-a-new-low/">Ionosphere</a> is encroaching on our atmosphere, perhaps because </li>
<p>   <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/14/even-quieter-on-the-solar-front-another-all-quiet-alert-issued/">the sun seems to be dying</a>
<li>The Earth's <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-magnetic-field-has-massive-breach-scientists-baffled/">protective magnetic field</a> has a massive breach allowing solar winds to bombard us with space stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>Both stories illustrate our minute understanding of&#160; our planet, its atmosphere, our solar system, the universe, and God.&#160; In relative terms, James Hansen and Stephen Hawking know no more than a 2-year-old idiot-Savant.&#160; </p>
<p>When someone tells you--someone with nine impressive abbreviations following his surname--that man-made global warming will kill all the polar bears and <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/14/gore-entire-north-polar-ice-cap-will-be-gone-in-5-years/">destroy the North Pole</a> in five years unless we ban smoking, beef, and barbecues tomorrow, smile and remember that, despite what you learned in Physical Science 204, we don't even know what magnetism is. </p>
<p>If scientists cannot account for the sun, then they will never account for man's influence on climate.&#160; </p>
<p>We are more ignorant than ants. And <a href="http://tomnelson.blogspot.com/">Tom Nelson</a> is the master at pointing out the ignorance of Captain Planet's platoon.</p>
