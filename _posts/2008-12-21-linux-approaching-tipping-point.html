<p>Rarely does a single factor cause a paradigm shift.&nbsp; For one example, look at the election of Ronald Reagan.&nbsp; Sure, Reagan had a great message, <img style="max-width:800px;float:right;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:10px;" src="http://www.disco-tech.org/Linux%20tux-large.jpg" width="108" height="129" />expert delivery, and that presidential look.&nbsp; But without Carter's bungling incompetence, excesses by liberals in Congress, a runaway Supreme Court, Soviet expansion, stagflation, the Iranian hostage crisis, and seventeen thousand other annoying problems, Reagan would not have upset an incumbent president in 1980.&nbsp; <br /><b><br />Revenge of the Nerds</b></p>
<p>Since 1999, my IT friends have been predicting the rise of the Linux desktop.&nbsp; Since 1999, they've been wrong.&nbsp; Being IT professionals and excellent programmers, they failed to realize that the average home user does not have the patience nor the inclination to learn sudo apt-get nonsense.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want single-click installation.&nbsp; (Actually, they want to merely imagine something and have their computer make it so.)&nbsp; Linux had no product managers to demand ease of use.&nbsp; The Linux community didn't understand that they were not their (potential) users.</p>
<p><b>A Linux Distribution People Can (almost) Use</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> might soon change that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"><img style="max-width:800px;float:left;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-right:10px;" src="http://www.ubuntu.com/themes/ubuntu07/images/ubuntulogo.png" /></a>Last week I installed Ubuntu 8.10 on my wife's laptop.&nbsp; (It dual-boots Vista Home Basic for her Zune and a few other incompatible activities related to her job.)&nbsp; After getting both systems working smoothly, I went the extra step of setting up Ubuntu's Gnome desktop system to work and look like Mac's OS X.&nbsp; I friggin' love it.</p>
<p>The reason for installing Linux on this machine was economics--and that's one of the factors that could put Linux on a lot of desktops in the next 2 years.&nbsp; My wife's laptop is limited to 1.25 GB RAM.&nbsp; It has a barebones video card.&nbsp; I just replace the 60 GB hard drive with a 160 GB one because the 60 GB was 90 percent full even though all of our User files (docs, photos, music, videos, downloads, etc) are stored on an external HD. I used an out of the box install of Vista--not the OEM disk from Toshiba--so that I could install the minimum crap necessary to run the computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Running Out of RAM</b></p>
<p>When I fire up Vista, it immediately consumes 600 MB of the 1.1 GB of RAM available after the video card steals its share.&nbsp; Open a browser (we use Google Chrome, the best browser ever made) and RAM usage is up to 700 MB.&nbsp; Browse an image-happy site, and the damn thing starts swapping!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boot into Ubuntu, though, and the OS uses only about 212 MB of RAM.&nbsp; Open a browser and 10 other programs, and you're up to about 500 MB.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Moreover, there's no anti-virus software inspecting every 0 and1 because Linux is pretty much immune to viruses.&nbsp; And it's free.</p>
<p><b>Six-Factor Tipping Point</b></p>
<p>But the tipping point toward Linux requires a few other factors that have also come to pass:
<ul>
<li>Google Docs and Google Apps give most users all the word processing, spreadsheet, collaboration, scheduling, messaging, and email functionality they'll ever need--for free</li>
<li>Ubuntu keeps your system up-to-date with just about any application you'll ever want--for free</li>
<li>The economy makes the bells and whistles that drove Windows to the top of the market seeem pretentious and embarrassing</li>
<li>Every year, the computer skills of the world's users increases rather dramatically so that more people can deal with unforgivable terminal commands like 'sudo apt-get epiphany-browser'</li>
<li>Companies looking to cut their IT costs will begin moving more and more software out of their in-house data centers and into the clouds (Google Apps instead of Exchange server and Microsoft Office will be a major theme for enterprises in 2009)</li>
<li>Companies will figure out that with Linux desktops, they can get more years from cheaper PCs for zero cost of desktop applications and operating systems</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were Microsoft, I'd be worried.&nbsp; And I drank the Redmond Kool-Aid many years ago when Steve Balmer gave me a free copy of all of Microsoft's business-related software in order to help my fledgling book publishing company.&nbsp; In return, I helpd convert 2 companies into Microsoft shops.&nbsp; I still love Microsoft, but with an almost or actual depression staring the world in the eyes, I'm not sure I can afford their stuff any longer.</p>
