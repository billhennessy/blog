<p>MSNBC.com lea<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34703765@N00/3126038874"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/3126038874_1b872f6fdd_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>ds off this Sunday with a photo montage of serious winter weather from Pacific to Maine.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>To the left, all snow, all winter weather is "freak."&amp;nbsp; To those of us with memories longer than our . . . privates . . . and a sense of history that exceeds our senses of fashion, winters are beginning to look a like winters past.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The temperature was 7 when I got up this morning.&amp;nbsp; I used to play hockey outside at Steinberg every Sunday in temperatures colder than this.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you scream that weather != climate: I get it.&nbsp; But climate is the &sum; of weather, is it not? And when we have year after year of decreasing average temperature, increasing average snowfall, and growing glaciers, we have a climate trend of cold.</p>
<p>I'd like to know what James Hansen is doing to keep warming these day.&nbsp; Perhaps he's discharging CO2 fire extinguishers in his living room.</p>
