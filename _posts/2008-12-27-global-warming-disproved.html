<p><img class="alignright" title="Global Warming" src="http://www.globalwarminghysteria.com/storage/disaster.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152" />Hey, folks, I haven't read <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/3982101/2008-was-the-year-man-made-global-warming-was-disproved.html">the whole thing</a>.&nbsp; But in the second paragraph we seem to find the answer to whole global warming problem:&nbsp; ignore it.</p>
<blockquote><p>First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades. This winter, with the whole of Canada and half the US under snow, looks likely to be even worse. After several years flatlining, global temperatures have dropped sharply enough to cancel out much of their net rise in the 20th century.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm all for<a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/27/blizzard-traps-thousands-in-india/"> repudiation of the AGW myth</a>--don't get me wrong.&nbsp; But I was hoping for the chance to punch James Hansen in mouth before the whole thing collapsed.</p>
