<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9461" title="jennifer_aniston" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/jennifer_aniston-300x300.jpg" alt="jennifer_aniston" width="300" height="300" />No, I'm not a celebrity freak; I'm just a red-blooded American male who thinks Jennifer Aniston is about as gorgeous as a celebrity can be. &nbsp;(She's almost as beautiful as my wife.) &nbsp;I have no idea what she's like in real life. &nbsp;I have no knowledge of her politics. &nbsp;I don't know whether she's fallen for the global warming idiocy. &nbsp;All I know is that she looks and acts (in public) like the sort of girl I'd want my sons to marry. &nbsp;(For the record, Angelina Jolie is also beautiful, but she's the kind of woman I'd hope my sons would stay away from.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, now, she's played the B-list to her ex-husband and (the sort of trashy) Angelina Jolie. &nbsp;It's good see that Jennifer Aniston's new movie "Marley &amp; Me" <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473107,00.html" target="_blank">drew larger audiences</a> in its debut than Brad's new movie. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And I hope Jennifer Aniston is as sweet and friendly in real life as her public persona indicates.</p>
