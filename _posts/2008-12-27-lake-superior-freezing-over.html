<p><img class="alignright" title="Lake Superior" src="http://www.piercecountyherald.com/gfx/photos/full/ice.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="224" />Even as CO2 levels rise, western Lake Superior is <a href="http://www.riverfallsjournal.com/articles/index.cfm?id=18723&amp;section=homepage&amp;property_id=18">freezing over</a> for the first time years.</p>
<blockquote><p>The western tip of Lake Superior has frozen over in December for the first time in recent memory, and that could mean a long season of ice angling that hasn&rsquo;t been seen in years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just talking that it&rsquo;s been something like 17 years since we had a good, long ice fishing season at this corner of Lake Superior,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Russ Francisco, owner of Marine General sporting goods store in Duluth. &ldquo;This is the most ice I&rsquo;ve seen in December in years. &hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t go out yet, but if it stays cold and we don&rsquo;t get a big wind, people will be out there fishing soon.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Next question: &nbsp;Has Al Gore been to Duluth recently?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the AGW world, Fred Singer posts a brief but <a href="http://jennifermarohasy.com/blog/2008/12/global-warming-since-1958/">debilitating blow</a>&nbsp;(via Jennifer Marohasy) to the AGW idiots at IPCC. &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>In conclusion: The IPCC&rsquo;s &lsquo;most&rsquo; is not sustained by observations; the human contribution is very likely only 10% or even less.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you go.</p>
