<p><img class="alignright" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/israel-flag.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="298" />Israel's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSLS69391620081228?sp=true" target="_blank">assault on Hamas terrorists</a> in Gaza continued for a second day. &nbsp;As if reading from a script, the UN Security Council called for an immediate stop to Israel's self-defense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As the air strikes continued, Israel has moved more <a href="http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1050410.html">troops and tanks </a>to the border, possibly in preparation for an incursion into the area now under terrorist control.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LR167601.htm">internation responses</a> were less than predictable, though. &nbsp;France, for instance, demands first that the terrorists stop pitching rockets at Israeli school kids, then that Israel stop its air assault. &nbsp;Fair enough, but few say that. &nbsp;Except for France and the United States, international reaction is wholly anti-Israeli. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Barack Obama has made many anti-Israeli statements in his life. &nbsp;Many of his foreign policy advisors are ardently anti-Israel. &nbsp;Samantha Power was removed from the campaign for advocating that the US invade Israel and impose a pro-Palestian peace treaty, but she is now in line for senior post in the Obama White House.</p>
<p>Further, Obama has demonstrated an extreme lack of understanding or will in dealing with Iran. In a profoundly September 10th moment, he refered to Iran as a tiny country that could not pose a threat the United States. &nbsp;Obama has not publicly condemned Iran's policy of seeking the elimination of Israel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Put this together, and Israel must feel very alone in the world right now. &nbsp;Her greatest ally since her formation, the US, seems to have joined ranks of the pro-Palestinian EU crowd. &nbsp;As Iran, with Russia's backing, prepares to unleash nuclear hell somewhere in the world, Israel rightly flexes its muscles. &nbsp;Someone must stand for freedom.</p>
