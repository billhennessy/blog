<p>After a 2 year hiatus from annual predictions, here's what I see happening in the precarious Year of our Lord Two-thousand nine:</p>
<p><strong>The Dow</strong>:&#160; The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500. </p>
<p><strong>GDP and Economy</strong>:&#160; By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation "Great Depression II."&#160; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall.&#160; Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q1</strong>:&#160; -.06</p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>: -1.5</p>
<p><strong>Q3</strong>: -6.5</p>
<p><strong>Q4</strong>: -2.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>US Treasuries:&#160; </strong>Moody's warns investors in US Treasuries that inflation could erode the real value of the paper dramatically but falls short of lowering bond ratings.&#160; China and Japan sell over $1 trillion in long-term US debt.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Industry</strong>:&#160; The bridge loan isn't enough and the UAW refuses major compromises, but Obama and Congress block GM and Chrysler from bankruptcy.&#160; Instead, Congress authorizes $70 billion in exchange for voting stock and a seat on the companies' boards.&#160; The companies oblige, effectively becoming government agencies.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Iraq</strong>:&#160; The slow drawdown of troops will continue according to the plan approved by Iraq in 2008.&#160; The net effect of Obama's win on Iraq is zero. </p>
<p><strong>Iran</strong>:&#160; The Obama administration achieves a pyrrhic victory by signing a non-proliferation agreement with Iran similar to the one Clinton (via Carter) signed with North Korea.&#160; By the end of 2009, Iran's cheating is obvious, but both the US and UN ignore it . . . until it's too late.&#160; Israel acts alone. </p>
<p><strong>Key Legislation:&#160; </strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fairness Doctrine</strong> returns requiring television and radio stations to provide equal time to all sides of any news or science issue with the exception of climate science.</p>
<p><strong>Emission Standards</strong> increased dramatically by Congress and rubber-stamped by GM and Chrysler boards.&#160; Ford sues claiming unfair competition and anti-trust violations.&#160; Suit will take years to settle.</p>
<p><strong>Unions</strong> can demand to know a non-union's position on unionization votes.&#160; Many shops turn union; many anti-union workers are assaulted and threatened.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Medical workers</strong> are compelled to participate in abortions regardless of religious or personal beliefs.&#160; Thousands of doctors and nurses quit in protest.&#160; The Catholic church closes thousands of hospitals creating the greatest healthcare availability crisis ever in a post-industrial country.&#160; Congress prepares, by year's end, to take over the healthcare industry and all medical universities and colleges. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sports</strong></p>
<p>Several major professional sports teams fold as advertising dollars disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>
<p>No one really cares after reading the list above.</p>
<p><strong>Politics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Newt Gingrich</strong> prepares a presidential run in 2012 by quarterbacking a team of more than 200 Republican Congressional candidates on single agenda to win back Washington and capitalism.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Climate Change</strong>:&#160; 2008 was the coolest year in almost 20 years, and 2009 looks to be even cooler.&#160; A major flaw is revealed in the most sophisticated models.&#160; James Hansen refuses to admit he was wrong, but even the media stop covering climate change.&#160; Environmentalism shifts to potable water, an actual problem that will affect the US in 20 years as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogallala_Aquifer">Ogallala Aquifer</a> dries up. </p>
