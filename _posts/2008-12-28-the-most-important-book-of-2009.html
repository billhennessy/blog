<p>I just finished &ldquo;The Power of Less&rdquo; and its companion ebook, &ldquo;Thriving on Less.&rdquo; I hope everyone&ndash;and I mean everyone&ndash;reads these books before the end of January.</p>
<p><a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hennesssview-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=1401309704&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;m=amazon&#038;lc1=0000FF&#038;bc1=000000&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr">http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hennesssview-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=1401309704&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;m=amazon&#038;lc1=0000FF&#038;bc1=000000&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr</a></p>
<p>Why are these books so important? Because life changed in 2008. The commitments we&rsquo;d made as individuals, families, communities, nations, and the world received a margin call. We had biggest margin call in history, and everyone from plumbers to Harvard MBAs (especially the MBAs) lacked the capital to pay the bill.</p>
<p>As a result, we can feel something unsettled inside of us. There&rsquo;s a voice telling us to slow down, to demand better instead of more, to raise our standards for living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Power of Less&rdquo; crystallizes those murky feelings into clear, undeniable truths. You cannot read the book without realizing&ndash;on page one&ndash;that you have too much stuff on your desk, in your house, on your mind, and in your life. And most of that stuff has little value or quality.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Leo Babauta, and thank you. You have given me direction. Many others will surely follow.</p>
<p>**UPDATE** Leo Babauta has launched the 30 day<a href="http://zenhabits.net/2008/12/make-2009-great-join-the-power-of-less-new-years-challenge/" target="_blank"> Power of Less Challenge </a>at ZenHabits.com. &nbsp;Instead of making a New Year's resolution (or 9) that you'll forget about before the Arizona Cardinals win the Super Bowl, try this challenge. &nbsp;The idea seems sound to me, and it's helped Leo become a productivity guru. &nbsp; &nbsp;My new habit? &nbsp;Exercise. &nbsp;I've been off the treadmill (and weight bench) for over a year. &nbsp;Since I quit smoking in November, the size 42 waist won't be far behind unless I get moving.&nbsp;</p>
