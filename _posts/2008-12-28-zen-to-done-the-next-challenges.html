<p>Several weeks ago, I posted about Leo Babauta's Zen to Done method for Getting Things Done. &nbsp;I apologize for not keeping up my blogging on my progress. &nbsp;But one habit at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Habit One: &nbsp;Capturing Everything</strong></p>
<p>More than a month later, I can proudly say I've mastered the first step in the program. &nbsp;I still record everything on Jott, either on the web or by voice messaging Jott. &nbsp;I've been consistent with the exception of three days at the beginning of December. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The practice has made a difference. &nbsp;I remember all of my commitments, and I remember when I can do something about them (even trivial commitments like picking up hamburger buns on the way home from work) . &nbsp;This leaves my active mind to concentrate on work, blog ideas, book ideas, and family. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Side Benefit of a Comprehensive List</strong></p>
<p>I've discovered a fantastic side benefit: &nbsp;I do less. &nbsp; The reason I do less is because I can see <em>all</em>&nbsp;of my commitments on a single list. &nbsp;The low value tasks stick out like a sore thumb. &nbsp;I feel no guilt saying "no" to tasks that do not add value. &nbsp;Moreover, I can show my list to people requesting something of me and ask them to judge where their task falls on the value list. &nbsp;If they say, "at the top," I know it's important, at least to them. &nbsp;If they say, "I don't know," they really mean, "nowhere on <em>that</em>&nbsp;list." &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next Challenge: &nbsp;Processing Inboxes</strong></p>
<p>Since I began David Allen's Getting Things Done method about 10 years ago (I bought the hard back), I didn't feel I needed to work on this for a month--I've been processing my email and paper inboxes to empty at least once a week for years. &nbsp;It's automatic. &nbsp;So I skipped this habit and moved on to my current habit . . .</p>
<p><strong>Habit Three: &nbsp;Planning</strong></p>
<p>I've started doing my Big Rocks first thing in the morning--twice every morning, actually. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I get up (about 5:00), I make a cup of coffee (in my Tassimo) and email myself my MITs (Most Important Tasks) for the day. &nbsp;These are the tasks not related to my day job. &nbsp;Some tasks involve the book I'm working on, some involve family or the house, some involve other projects I'm working on, like building a simple platform bed for my wife. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday Nights, I spend only about 10 minutes planning the week ahead. &nbsp;I'm not a big fan of elaborate plans, so I don't go beyond 10 minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I write myself a future journal entry. &nbsp;In other words, I pretend I'm writing about my projects on a future date, after my planned completion. &nbsp;This 30 minute exercise creates a powerful mental and emotional image of the accomplishment. &nbsp;Writing, "Last week, Amazon released my new book . . ." is far more powerful than, "I hope Amazon carries the book I think I'm going to write--someday . . . " &nbsp;Writing about your accomplishments in the past tense is the only way to convince your mind that you can do it. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How I'm Doing on Habit 3</strong></p>
<p>So far, I've been about 60 percent. &nbsp;That's better than I've been at planning in the past. (I told you that I don't like planning.) &nbsp;Now that I've publicized my goal, though, I'm sure I'll get some encouragement from others. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finally, A Small Favor</strong></p>
<p>If you notice that I haven't written about my ZTD progress in a few days, please post a comment to remind me. &nbsp;I'll return the favor if you email me.</p>
