<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/early.jpg"><img style="border-width:0;" border="0" alt="early" align="right" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/early-thumb.jpg" width="288" height="192" /></a> Sometimes decades start early; sometimes they start late. </p>
<p><strong>The 1960s</strong> started with JFK's assassination--until then, they were a lot like the 50s except with a young president whose economic policies were to the right of his Republican predecessor's.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>The 1970s</strong> culturally started with Woodstock in 1969.&#160; As Hunter S. Thompson pointed out in <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em>, Woodstock was not a celebration but a funeral.&#160; It marked the end of the hopeful part of whatever the 60s were and the beginning of the malaise of the 1970s.&#160; His example was dead on--the hippies switched from the mind expanding hallucinogens to the daze-inducing depressants like heroin, Quaaludes, and tulio.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>The 80s</strong>?&#160; The US Olympic hockey team upset the Soviets in the Lake Placid Olympics, freeing Americans to, once again, wear the American flag and sing patriotic hymns.&#160; Frank Gifford tells a story of walking into a restaurant just as the game (carried locally on closed circuit) was ending.&#160; This was a posh, upscale restaurant and many of the clients were in Lake Placid on business, not to cheer on the US teams.&#160; When the buzzer sounded to end the game, the diners rose spontaneously and sang the Star-Spangled Banner, full-voiced, tears streaming down their cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>The 1990s</strong> began when President George H. W. Bush <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9E0CE5D71230F93AA35752C0A964958260">threw up</a> on the Japanese Prime Minister during dinner.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>The Double-Os started on 9/11/2001.&#160; </strong></p>
<p>The teens began <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123051066413538349.html">just after Labor Day 2008</a> when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the government seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--the proximate cause of the bubble and its corresponding pop.</p>
<p><strong>The Teens Will Be a Time of Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>While many of us still worry about our financial health in the coming years, we'd be lying if we didn't admit to a certain sense of freedom.&#160; We're free to stop pursuing more of everything and bigger of the rest. </p>
<p>Those of us in humbler homes won't feel apologetic when we visit friends in McMansions.&#160; We won't feel like bad parents because our kids' clothes come from Old Navy instead of Abercrombie.&#160; We won't gauge our happiness by the number of HD channels we receive.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Simplifying Business</strong></p>
<p>Companies that try to inflate their top lines will fail.&#160; Gross revenue will be far less important than profits after debt, which could become an important ratio in for the next decade. </p>
<p>But getting healthy bottom line under a decreasing top line will force many changes in many companies.&#160; The enterprise data center will be a thing of the past in companies that survive.&#160; I recently examined a company and found that switching to Gmail for email, calendars, IM, and tasks would save over $1,000 a year per employee, or 97 percent.&#160; Using Google for word processing, presentations, and spreadsheets could save another $500 a year.&#160; For a company of 1,000 employees, that's $1.5 million a year.&#160; This company has 3,000 employees and could add $4.5 million it its bottom line--if it takes my advice.</p>
<p>Hierarchies will collapse under their own weight.&#160; The top line gross revenue sustains 6-layer management structures.&#160; Without inflated revenues, big chunks of bureaucracy and management layers will necessarily die.&#160; Smart companies will prune early in 2009; stupid companies will hack away in a panic mode around May.&#160; If you're a middle manager, look up or down for your next job--the middle is going away.</p>
<p><strong>Dressing</strong></p>
<p>Look at the hands.&#160; The era of 19 rings on 10 fingers is about to end.&#160; Simplicity requires reduction to the essentials.&#160; Coco Chanel's advice will hold sway:&#160; "When accessorizing, always take off the last thing you put on."&#160; </p>
<p>Hem lines will lengthen, and colors will darken.&#160; Brown suits and sport coats and dress shoes will rival black in popularity. Hairstyles will be shorter and more conservative. </p>
<p><strong>Furnishing and Decorating</strong></p>
<p>Minimalism dominates the coming 10 years.&#160; Ikea furniture, platform beds with no headboard or a very simple one.&#160; Floor space and wall space will become valued again.&#160; Decorations will stand out simply because they become more scarce.&#160; Value and quality replace price and quantity.&#160; </p>
<p>"The more the better," gives way to "the better the better."</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong></p>
<p>Meaning, not sarcasm, rules.&#160; With smaller entertainment budgets, Americans will demand moving experiences and high quality in their entertainment choices.&#160; There will be fewer movies released, but better ones.&#160; There will be fewer television shows and networks.&#160; </p>
<p>Entertainment will become more active and less passive.&#160; Movies, concerts, TV are all passive forms of entertainment.&#160; But 30 years ago, entertainment usually meant doing things with friends and family.&#160; Look for that old definition to return. People will entertain instead of being entertained.</p>
<p><strong>Living Pace</strong></p>
<p>All of these trends culminate in a drastic change to the speed of life.&#160; We will move more slowly in the coming decade.&#160; We'll save for that luxury or that vacation rather than borrowing for them.&#160; We'll get things in time.&#160; All in good time.</p>
<p>This deceleration seems liberating, too.&#160; Instead of the race to be the first, we'll plan to be the best.&#160; We'll share experiences rather than dominate conversations.&#160; We'll show up instead of showing off.&#160; Family rooms and corner bars will become the new chat rooms.&#160; Multitasking will sound like a pathology. </p>
