  content: "Congratulations on quitting, Bill.  That's awesome!\n\nYou reminded me
    that it's been months since I visited QuitNet, so I just logged in and here are
    my stats:\n\nYour Quit Date is:   10/17/2006\nTime Smoke-Free: 806 days, 12 hours\nCigarettes
    NOT smoked: 16130\nLifetime Saved:  4 months, 3 days, 5 hours\nMoney Saved: $4,191.20
    \n\nMy mom died from lung cancer in 2005 and I realized that I don't ever want
    the people who love me to watch me go through something like that.  I've never
    seen someone suffer the way she did.  It took a while, but I finally quit cold
    turkey in 2006 and I will never go back.  I still smoke in my dreams, but I can
    go weeks without thinking about smoking while I'm awake."

  content: "I'm sorry to hear about your mom.  But I had to laugh when I read that
    you smoke in your dreams.  When I was quit for 3.5 years, I smoked in my dreams,
    too.  Then (in the dream) I'd be all freaked about getting caught.  I'd lie and
    hide my breath.  I'd be afraid to talk to anyone.  \n\nCongratulations on 2+ years
    without a smoke."

<p>I might have mentioned in an earlier post that I quit smoking about a month ago.  I must thank Leo Babauta, his blog <a href="http://www.zenhabits.net">ZenHabits.net</a>, and his ebook, Zen to Done, for giving me the motivation and confidence to quit.</p>
<p>I have quit in the past.  I went almost 4 years between 1998 and 2002, so I know I can do it for good.</p>
<p>While the money I've saved on cigarettes I've plowed back into nicotine lozenges, it's amazing how quickly the savings add up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Time Smoke-Free:31 days, 9 hours, 50 minutes and 37 seconds<br />
Cigarettes NOT smoked:628<br />
Lifetime Saved:4 days, 19 hours<br />
Money Saved:$124.80</p></blockquote>
<p>If you smoke and are thinking about quitting, $125 a month in today's economy might be enough to push you over the top.  (If you smoke less than I did, your savings will be less, of course.)</p>
<p>I recommend using<a href="http://www.quitnet.com" target="_blank"> Quitnet.com</a> to keep track of your quit. &nbsp;You can get a daily email with the stats listed above. &nbsp;Even though I don't like readin email first thing in the morning, I do open this one as soon as I get to my computer. &nbsp;I know approximately what it will contain--yesterday's savings + $3.85, yesterday's cigarettes not smoked + 20, yesterday's lifetime saved + a couple of hours. &nbsp;But its a great affirmation of the control I have gained over myself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the greatest drags of smoking is the dependency on the tools of the trade: &nbsp;going out of your way to pick up a pack of smokes so you have some for the morning; checking pockets for a lighter before you leave the house; carefully scanning the environment for No Smoking signs every time you go someplace new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of those actions demonstrates that something else has control over you. &nbsp;Quitting smoking frees you from those chains of dependency. &nbsp;Breaking them adds confidence in countless other areas of life, from finances to career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, thanks, Leo.</p>
