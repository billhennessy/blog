<p>It's first and ten again.&#160; </p>
<p>Most years New Years just sort of happens.&#160; It arrives.&#160; Getting out of 2008 felt like we went for it on 4th and 13 deep inside our own territory.&#160; We pulled the goalie and went with&#160; a sixth attacker.&#160; We sent an injured Albert Pujols to pinch hit for our best reliever.&#160; We pulled out all the stops.</p>
<p>The year 2008 will go down as a watershed year.&#160; It was the year in which man officially rejected God-given liberty and returned to the age-old theory that all power comes from government.&#160; According to this theory, good governments dole out lots of cash and freedom to the commoners, while bad governments keep the money and chain the people.&#160;&#160; For good or ill, though, we have given up on the idea of self-rule and limited government.&#160; </p>
<p>Were I more ambitious, I'd write the history of the self-rule.&#160; From Runnymede to that day September when John McCain left the campaign trail to help Hank Paulson drive a stake in the heart of capitalism.&#160; </p>
<p>I'd write about self-rule's greatest moments.&#160; How 'bout Ronald Reagan's famous declaration that, "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to the problem; government <em>is</em> the problem."&#160;&#160;&#160; Or Thomas Jefferson's prophetic foreboding that the Constitution would become a thing of wax in the hands of the Supreme Court.&#160; Or Alexis de Tocqueville's eerily accurate description of despotism in America:&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>It would seem that if despotism were to be established among the democratic nations of our days, it might assume a different character; it would be more extensive and more mild; it would degrade men without tormenting them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Degrade men without tormenting them."&#160;&#160; Indeed.</p>
<p>What will we do with this fresh set of downs?&#160; It's late in the game.&#160;&#160; We're still in 4 down territory.&#160; Our net is empty, and Pujols has a full count.&#160; What will come of this experiment in 2009?&#160; Will we accept our degradation, or will we fight against the machine, against this extensive and mild despotism?&#160; </p>
<p>I hope we fight.&#160; I fear we've already accepted the surrender. </p>
