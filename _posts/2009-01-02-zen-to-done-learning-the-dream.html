<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9271" title="ra100998.jpg" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ra1009982.jpg" alt="ra100998.jpg" width="170" height="113" />Feeling confident, relaxed, and complete is a dream. Many people believe it's an impossible dream.&nbsp; I'm learning otherwise.</p>
<p>I'm into my third month of acquiring positive habits with Leo Babauta's<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=56260&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=41653"> Zen to Done</a> method.&nbsp; At the same time, I'm working the 30 day challenge.&nbsp; What I've learned so far is that I hold onto too much.</p>
<ul>
<li>I carried around anger and frustration over missed goals and failed or abandoned projects</li>
<li>I vilified good people (in my mind) because I wanted to get my way all the time about everything</li>
<li>I sabotaged myself by trying to do everything anyone asked of me</li>
<li>I was afraid to look weak, and that fear weakened me</li>
</ul>
<p>The faultering economy, no doubt, led me to<a href="http://www.zenhabits.net"> Zen Habits</a>, which led me to Zen to Done, which led me to "The Power of Less," which led me to the<a href="http://www.sedona.com"> Sedona Method</a>, which led me here.&nbsp; I plan to keep going.&nbsp; You can, too.&nbsp; Misery might love company, but awakening bliss loves it more.&nbsp; The difference is that bliss can take being alone but misery cannot.</p>
<p>Here's my prescription for anyone who feels weak, overwhelmed, over-burdened, tired, angry, wronged, hurt, behind schedule, afraid, or lonely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Today: Visit Zen Habits and poke around once this weekend</li>
<li>Week 1:&nbsp; Commit to visiting Zen Habits once a day for 20 minutes 3 days next week</li>
<li>Week 2:&nbsp; Visit <a href="http://www.thepowerofless.com">The Power of Less</a> for 20 minutes 3 days and decide if you'd like to read the book</li>
<li>Week 3:&nbsp; Buy "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1401309704?tag=hennesssview-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1401309704&amp;adid=0G8AG9S60840NYM3R5PR&amp;">The Power of Less</a>" and read it.&nbsp; (It took me only two days to read it, but I read fast)</li>
<li>Week 4:&nbsp; Join the 30 Day Challenge to adopt any good habit you desire</li>
</ul>
<p>In just 4 weeks you'll be on your way to a fuller life with less.&nbsp; It's a better way to live.&nbsp; Many people around will thank you for the commitment.</p>
<p>*UPDATE*&nbsp; The Power of Less is now #47 on<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/new-releases/books/ref=pd_nr_pg_2?ie=UTF8&amp;pg=2"> Amazon's Hottest Releases list</a>.&nbsp; Congratulations, Leo!</p>
