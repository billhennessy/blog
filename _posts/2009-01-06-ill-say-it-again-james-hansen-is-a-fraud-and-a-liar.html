  content: Dear Madelyn,   Thanks for sending James Hansens's piece in the New Yorker.  Without
    taking sides in the Hennesey/Hansen dispute I invite your attention to "another
    view" about Hansen.   David

<blockquote><p>It seems that NASA's James Hansen, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), is at it again.  He just can't let the data speak for itself.  In yet another egregious display of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arrogance, he changed the temperature data from 1910-2008 to reflect what is clearly a cooling trend to reflect a warming trend.  (Y-axis = Annual Mean Temperatures in centigrade; X-axis = Year)</p>

<p>Because Hansen changes history (even 100-year-old records) regularly without explanation and always to make present seem relatively warmer than past dates, we have every reason to believe that James Hansen is a fraud and liar who made a big mistake before Congress 20 years ago and has been stealing government money to disguise that error ever since.</p>
<p>Don't we have a bureau to investigate misappropriation of government money?</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong.&nbsp; He might just be a really bad scientist.&nbsp; There is some evidence to support this possibility.&nbsp; He makes a LOT of mistakes and with increasing frequency.&nbsp; It's possible that he is suffering from the beginning stages of dementia.&nbsp; If that's so, why don't his healthier colleagues and assistants catch his errors--like publishing September temperatures as October temperatures?</p>
<p>Either way--incompetence or criminality--he should be removed from work at NASA and his opinions (they are nothing but that) disregarded among serious scientists.</p>
<p>The fact is that<a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/06/ncdc-updates-database-for-dec08-ncdcs-own-graphic-shows-10-year-cooling-trend/" target="_blank"> temperatures have been falling for 10 years</a> which violates all the models every built in support of human-caused global warming.&nbsp; That irrefutable fact so enrages AGW worshippers that they are rendered incapable of rational thought--which would lead them to my position.&nbsp; They would acknowledge our vast ignorance rather than feign infinite wisdom.</p>
