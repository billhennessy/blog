<p>Request:&nbsp; If you read a blog post on Hennessy's View that seems to be rooting for America to fail or suffer in order that Obama take the blame, please e-mail me (bill-at--hennessysview--dot--com) and comment.&nbsp; I'm a hot-head, and I might not catch myself.</p>
<p>The United States and every country on earth is in a <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090107/D95IJHTO0.html" target="_blank">perilous position right now</a>.&nbsp; The world economy is on the brink of depression.&nbsp; Bad business practices driven by even worse government policies and regulations have destroyed $ trillions in wealth and left us on a narrow, swampy peninsula between deflation and hyperinflation.</p>
<p>We have, for good or ill, elected a young and inexperienced president.&nbsp; That man's past rhetoric was clearly Marxist.&nbsp; But his post-election appointments and words seem closer to those of George Bush than of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Hall" target="_blank"> Gus Hall</a>.&nbsp; We can work to win back Congress and the White House without destroying the country in the process.</p>
<p>Here's a few recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Praise Obama's rightward tacks more than you attack his leftist moves</li>
<li>Look for people or businesses in your area who need help and help them if you can</li>
<li>State the positive results of conservative governance more often than you assail the consequences of liberal error</li>
<li>Wave to drivers of cars with Obama stickers, even as you pass them to expose your McCain-Palin tags</li>
<li>Write letters to the editor, blog comments, and blog posts complimenting Obama's good judgment, but always identify yourself as a conservative Republican who work for his defeat in 2012</li>
</ul>
<p>All of us are saying goodbye to co-workers let go because of the economy.&nbsp; The way out of this mess is lower taxes, less government, and graceful ends for companies that can't make it.&nbsp; Each of these right actions carries with it painful consequences for some of us.&nbsp; We can and must make these changes to our national direction.&nbsp; But we can and should make them without being asses.</p>
<p>We all know how painful and maddening it was to hear Democrats and liberals cheer American casualties in Iraq and fantasize about the assassination of a Republican president.&nbsp; While we might not go so far, why take the chance?&nbsp; Let's sell our superior system of economics and limited government.&nbsp; The deficincies of their alternative will be undeniably obvious soon enough.</p>
