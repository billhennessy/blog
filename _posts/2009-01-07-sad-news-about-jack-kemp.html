    That is a great story Bill. Sad to hear about Kemp.

    BTW, I like the new design of the site.

  content: Thank you.  I liked my old layout, but it was very slow and little crowded.  This
    layout discourages me from flooding it with too much advertising and useless widgets.

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9551" title="Plaza Hotel 100 Years" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/jackkemp1-207x300.jpg" alt="Plaza Hotel 100 Years" width="207" height="300" />The first time I met George W. Bush in person, I was campaigning for Jack Kemp for President.&nbsp; Kemp was running against Vice President George H. W. Bush (and 47 others) for the Republican nomination.&nbsp; This was 1987.</p>
<p>A wonderful, tough, and tireless local Republican organizer named Thelma Stuart recruited me and served as my mentor in Dixiecrat-style politics of South Carolina.&nbsp; My first gig was manning the Kemp booth at the Low Country Stump Days in Charleston.&nbsp; Being the Reagan 80s, we were decked out in straw hats with red, white, and blue bands, blue blazers, khakis, no socks, and Sperry topsiders.&nbsp; I wore a red, white, and blue Repp tie (which not coincidentially matched the one Kemp wore that day) on a blue Brooks Brother's button-down oxford.</p>
<p>The booth workers were excited:&nbsp; Mr. Kemp had stopped by the booth several times, and we thought we were about to meet the vice president.&nbsp; When the motorcade with "Bush 88" regalia stopped at the gates of fairgrounds, I tried to act nonchalante as I craned my neck to catch a glimpse of the man who coined the term "voodoo economics."</p>
<p>Instead, a younger man clearly led the delegation--a man who looked shockingly like his mother Barbara.&nbsp; George W. Bush knew that Kemp was his father's primary adversary.&nbsp; He made a confident and quick beel-line to our little hut of aluminum polls and white canvass.</p>
<p>"I'm George Bush, and I'd like for you to vote for my dad," Bush informed me as if he knew . . . KNEW . . . that I would.&nbsp; His glare was powerful and intimidating, his handshake painfully firm, his voice powerful and certain.&nbsp; He held my gaze a good 10 seconds after issuing his command.</p>
<p>All I could muster was, "Pleased to meet, sir.&nbsp; And I'd like for you to vote for Jack Kemp."</p>
<p>The future liberator of Iraq and Afghanistan smiled slyly.&nbsp; He didn't find my remark funny but ballsy.&nbsp; He moved onto the Pat Robertson booth next door.</p>
<p>A minute later, Mr. Kemp was standing next to me.</p>
<p>"You handled that like a pro," he said.</p>
<p>I had to fight the smile.&nbsp; I was 24 and a submarine sailor violating the UCMJ by campaigning for a candidate for office.&nbsp; I'd be damned if I'd act like I hadn't heard better from better.&nbsp; But I hadn't.</p>
<p>I left the Navy for a year to campaign for Jack Kemp for President (1988), returning in 1989, long after Kemp's candidacy foundered.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/07/congressman-jack-kemp-cancer/">Former Congressman Jack Kemp Has Cancer - FOXNews.com Transition Tracker</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Jack Kemp's office says the former housing secretary, congressman and Buffalo Bills quarterback has been diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>A brief statement says Kemp is undergoing tests to determine the origin of the disease and how to go about treating it. The type of cancer was not disclosed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know many people (including me) slung arrows at Kemp and Bill Bennett over immigration a few years ago.  Aside from that, Kemp is right on almost everything.&nbsp; A gentleman and kind soul, <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=102x3677847" target="_blank">even the DUers</a> (at least as of this writing) cannot muster a hateful, gleeful shot at the ailing Kemp.&nbsp; Remarkably--and sadly--most of the blogs on the right are silent.&nbsp; Perhaps the bloggers are too young to remember Kemp's contribution?&nbsp; I hope that's it.</p>
<p>Some highlights that I remember (without Googling):</p>
<ul>
<li>AFL and NFL quarterback with San Diego and Buffalo</li>
<li>Champion of returning to the gold standard</li>
<li>Champion of the flat tax</li>
<li>Champion of Supply Side economics</li>
<li>One of Reagan's strongest allies and evangelists in Congress</li>
<li>Loved by his mostly Democrat constituents in Buffalo, NY</li>
<li>Compassion human being without falling for "compassionate conservatism"</li>
</ul>
<p>Kemp switched from QB to the offensive line when Reagan took office.&nbsp; As the Gipper called the plays, Kemp pulled, sweeping right behind the Congressional tackles, to wipe out the Democrats' defensive ends and shooting line backers.&nbsp; Reagan took it to the house without a hand laid on him.</p>
<p>All&nbsp; who considered themselves better off in 1984 than they were four years earlier owe a big thanks to Jack Kemp, no matter how they voted.</p>
<p>I'll say a prayer for Mr. Kemp, and I hope you will, too.</p>
