<p>For months I've been echoing the warnings of Peter Schiff and others:&nbsp; when China stops buying American debt, we're in deep, deep trouble.&nbsp; The possibility for hyperflation, prices rise by double-digits on daily or weekly measures, becomes palpably high.</p>
<p>Even though <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/07/business/yuan.php">this article from IHT</a> failed to suprised me, I have a sick, frightened gnawing in my stomach:</p>
<blockquote><p>China has bought more than $1 trillion in American debt, but as the global downturn has intensified, Beijing is starting to keep more of its money at home - a shift that could pose some challenges to the U.S. government in the near future but eventually may even produce salutary effects on the world&nbsp;economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Hank Paulson's Bailoutpalooza followed by Obama's promises to pile on more bailouts and $1 trillion or more in stimuli, the US single-year deficit for 2009 will be between $1.2 trillion and $2.5 trillion.</p>
<p>There are three ways to finance that deficit: tax, print, or borrow.</p>
<p>A tax increase, as we have been told, could push us into a deep depression.&nbsp; We don't want that.</p>
<p>Printing $2.5 trillion in new cash would lead to hyperinflation.&nbsp; Unless you want to buy bread for $3,000 a loaf, that's not good.</p>
<p>Borrowing delays the reckoning.</p>
<p>One way or another, we will deal with depression, hyperinflation, or--like Germany in the 1930s--both.&nbsp; At least in a depression with deflation, cash will save you.&nbsp; In hyperinflation, it's every man for himself.</p>
