<p>Once upon a time, when blogging was fresh and new, conservative blogs dominated the top of <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati's</a> most popular lists.&#160; <a href="http://michellemalkin.com">Michelle Malkin</a>, <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/">Powerline</a>, and <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/">InstaPundit</a> routinely led Talking Points and Kos.&#160; But we've fallen.&#160;&#160; Big time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Michelle was still the #1 conservative blog--at 39 overall.&#160; Huffington Post is #1, Kos is #8. </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p><strong>Reason 1:&#160; Focus</strong></p>
<p>Or lack thereof.&#160; The rising stars of the right aren't necessarily political, but scientific.&#160; <a href="http://tomnelson.blogspot.com/">Tom Nelson's blog</a> digests all of the day's (even hour's) top stories involving some idiotic global warming (aka "environmental," aka "sustainability," aka "climate change") news.&#160; <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/">Anthony Watts</a> is a seasoned meteorologist who provides deep dives into global warming news and science. </p>
<p>By focusing on a single issue, these blogs deliver one-stop shopping for conservatives in search of AGW news. Their blog rolls are similarly focused, allowing readers who want more to jump to another blog that emphasizes climate. </p>
<p>Most conservative blogs, by contrast, ramble.&#160; I don't mean that posts ramble, but the content is all over the map.&#160; Take Hennessy&rsquo;s View for example.&#160; I'll hit AGW, economics, and the 10th Amendment all in the same day.&#160; When a reader visits Hennessy's View, he has no idea what he'll get. </p>
<p><strong>Reason 2:&#160; Proliferation</strong></p>
<p>According to the Battleground Poll, 60 percent of voting-age Americans describe themselves as Somewhat or Very conservative.&#160; That means we have a pool of up to 126 million people to win over as regular readers.&#160; Of that 126 million, according to <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Groundswell/profile_tool.html">Forrester</a>, 25 percent are inactives when it comes to the internets, leaving 94.5 million for us to fight over. </p>
<p>While the liberals have 4 or 5 top blogs and lots of micro blogs, conservatives have a similar number of top blogs but many, many blogs just below the top.&#160; These high quality blogs cannibalize readership from the top 5.&#160; In other words, there are (my calculations) almost twice as many conservative blog readers as liberal readers, but our focus is diffused across many sites while the liberals concentrate attention on a handful of blogs.</p>
<p>Quantifying attitudes across 100 blogs is difficult.&#160; Quantifying top 100 is easy.&#160; So Technorati counts the top 100 which makes it look like liberal readership dwarfs conservative.</p>
<p><strong>Should We Care?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.&#160; The combination of lower rankings and scattered focus hurts the impact and influence of conservative blogs.&#160; "Most Read Blog in America" carries credibility with people we hope to influence.&#160; If you don't believe that, talk to a marketer.&#160; Similarly, people who can afford to shop in specialty shops do so because these shops are precise.&#160;&#160; A women's lingerie shop carries . . . you guessed it.&#160; No surprises or unfulfilled needs when a woman goes into Victoria's Secret.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>How to Fix This</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a solution for the whole right side of the web.&#160; But I will share a strategy I&rsquo;m going to employ for the next 4 weeks. </p>
<ol>
<li>Fewer Posts:&#160; Instead of blogging every stupid idea that pops into my head, I&rsquo;m going to focus on one quality entry per day.&#160; I&rsquo;ll start in the morning.&#160; If I have time to write and revise, I will do it before leaving for work.&#160; If not, like today, I&rsquo;ll revise and publish when I get home.&#160; This will allow me to post cleaner copy.</li>
<li>Limited Subjects:&#160; I will leave my categories for historical posts, but I am going to pick no more than 3 topics going forward:&#160; Global Warming, Limited Government, and Zen Conservatism.&#160; </li>
<li>Emphasis will be Zen Conservatism, which will be a focus on the positives of conservatism and the essential tenets thereof:&#160; life, liberty, the pursuit hapiness, and private property. </li>
</ol>
<p>One additional idea for the conservative blogosphere in general:&#160; narrow your focus.&#160; It isn&rsquo;t easy, but it&rsquo;s necessary.&#160; </p>
