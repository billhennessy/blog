<p><strong><em>The debtor is a slave to his lender. &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>Americans hold hundreds of billions of dollars in credit card debt alone. &nbsp;To this add automobiles, student loans, mortgages, medical, and myriad personal loans and you arrive at the staggering figure of<a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php"> $2.55&nbsp;</a><em><a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php">trillion with a 't'. &nbsp;</a></em></p>
<p>This massive debt--encouraged and backed by the US Government--makes us miserable. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;Are you happy? &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the debtor is slave to his lender, then the US Government is slave to China and Japan. &nbsp;Want to know why we ignored Tienenmen? &nbsp;Because our master told us to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US Government is on the hook for another $10 trillion, and that number is increasing at a rate of $1 trillion per month. &nbsp;Unless someone stops the madness, we'll be, as a nation, $22 trillion in debt by this time next year--more if the ecnomy worsens.</p>
<p><strong>Good Government Doesn't Run on Debt</strong></p>
<p>I am not a balanced budget purist. &nbsp;I understand that wars and other emergencies sometimes require deficit spending. But the current wars don't cost $22 trillion. &nbsp;Not even $1 trillion, unless you use New York Times math. &nbsp;So what's the excuse?</p>
<p><strong>Americans Are Spoiled Brats</strong></p>
<p>We want what we want, and we want it now. &nbsp;We've borrowed our way into slavery. &nbsp;When we hit our credit limits, swindler politicians offer to extend even more credit. &nbsp;So we become slaves to Congress, to the Department of Health and Human Services, to the EPA, and to every other government department and agency. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's humiliating, disgusting, and embarrassing. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What's the Answer?</strong></p>
<p>Stop borrowing. &nbsp;That means you, me, the government, your husband or wife, kids, everyone. &nbsp;Let the big banks fail; they are our pushers, our needle providers, our crack houses. &nbsp;But they only offered the easy credit with painless terms. &nbsp;They only offered a free t-shirt in exchange for our servitude. &nbsp;They only held out the pen. &nbsp;We took it into our eager little hands and signed over our lives. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Knock it OFF! &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Every time you vote for a politician who "brings home the bacon," you're selling yourself to yet another master. &nbsp;Last fall, the masters got together and decided to yank on the chains that bind you to them. &nbsp;It hurt, didn't it. &nbsp;It hurts still. &nbsp;And it will hurt worse over the coming years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government has absolutely no plan to pay off its loans. &nbsp;Have you noticed? &nbsp;It has no intention of paying off. &nbsp;Know why? &nbsp;Because there's no difference between goverment debt and personal debt. &nbsp;You will pay the $22 trillion AND the $2.55 trillion because YOU SIGNED FOR THE LOAN!</p>
<p><strong>Three Simple Steps</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Don't borrow another dime. &nbsp;Not for a car, not for college, not for a house, not for a television, gasoline, groceries, clothes, vacations. &nbsp;Stop borrowing. &nbsp;If you need help, read <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave Ramsey's</a> books<br />

<p>2. &nbsp;Have at least $1,000 in savings for true emergencies</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Pay off all of your debts as fast as you can, one at a time, beginning with the smallest balance and ending with the largest balance.</p>
<p>3.b. &nbsp;Elect politicians who will put up 100 percent of their personal assets (house, cars, savings) if they ever vote for a deficit budget outside of war.</p>
