<p>I&rsquo;m like a lot of people I know.&#160; We may be very different from you and those you know.&#160; But we&rsquo;re familiar to ourselves and to each other. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those people who tried to get There.&#160; </p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a place; it&rsquo;s a status.&#160; It&rsquo;s a moment.&#160; It&rsquo;s hearing that someone told someone else that you have &ldquo;one of those&rdquo; and they should see it.&#160; Maybe it&rsquo;s the big TV or the cool cappuccino machine.&#160; Maybe it&rsquo;s a boat or an SUV that costs more than the average American home and is only 3 square feet smaller. </p>
<p>Part of trying to get there is being there now.&#160; You have to play the part if you want to win the part.&#160; You can&rsquo;t live like a pauper if you have dreams of the Gold Coast, can you?&#160; </p>
<p>So we lived like there was no tomorrow.&#160; We bought the stuff that would impress everyone.&#160; We made it to all the big parties.&#160; We dressed the part.&#160; I had a pair of Kenneth Cole shoes in 2000 a full half-season before the hit the stores.&#160; I was <em>there</em>. </p>
<p>I never felt There, though.&#160; Even more strangely, I never felt here.&#160; I felt . . . scared.&#160; Not only did I not have everything I needed to be There, I didn&rsquo;t know how I was going to pay for where I was.&#160; Better get more stuff before somebody notices. </p>
<p>I hear people talk disparagingly about the greed and excess and conspicuous consumption of the 80s and of the 90s and of the 00s.&#160; There was a backlash in the early 1990s against the &ldquo;Reagan eighties.&rdquo;&#160; It lasted only until the stock market took off on the helium of the tech bubble.&#160; By 1996, we were all buying tickets to There, again.&#160; </p>
<p>In the early 2000s, we decried the excesses of the 90s, though, this time, a president&rsquo;s name wasn&rsquo;t associated with the excess.&#160; This time it was the &ldquo;dot com nineties.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>Then this.&#160; Credit markets crashed.&#160; Stock markets crashed.&#160; Housing markets crashed.&#160; Job markets.&#160; Name a market, and it crashed.&#160;&#160; Being There didn&rsquo;t help us this time . . . or the last time . . . or the time before that.&#160; Because it never was There. </p>
<p>Now we have a lot of stuff to get rid of.&#160; It&rsquo;s not as shiny and cool as it was when we bought it.&#160; Even if we bought two month ago.&#160; Everybody has one, anyway, and we only bought it to set ourselves apart.&#160;&#160; But we still get a bill for it every month.&#160; We will for a long time, unless we do something about that. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try.&#160; I&rsquo;m going put every penny I can into eliminating every debt I have.&#160; I&rsquo;ll the utilities, insurance, taxes, car repairs.&#160; You can have the rest, along with the crap it bought.&#160; </p>
<p>Contrary to the lies you hear from Hank Paulson and Barack Obama, the world doesn&rsquo;t run on credit.&#160; At least it shouldn&rsquo;t.&#160; Microsoft has no debt, nor does Walgreens.&#160; Circuit City does.&#160; So does Chrysler.&#160; Ditto GM.&#160; And Ford. </p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;d all be better off if Congress had never voted for that panicked bailout in September.&#160; But I&rsquo;m not taking that bailout. </p>
<p>There is a There somewhere, but it&rsquo;s inside of us.&#160; It was the original bailout and the only one anyone will ever need.&#160; It was delivered on a cross 2,000 years ago.&#160; </p>
