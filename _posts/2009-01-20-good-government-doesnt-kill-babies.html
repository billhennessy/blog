<p>One of Barack Obama's first actions as president will likely involve a series of executive orders ensuring that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/19/obama.abortion/index.html">as many abortions as possible happen</a>. Good government protects its most vulnerable citizens; bad government kills them.&nbsp;Nazi Germany killed the weak, the halt, the improvident. &nbsp;Of course, the Nazis trained specialist to carry out these grim and evil tasks. &nbsp;In America, we rely on ordinary citizens to do the killing for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That the murder of innocents ranks among<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/01/19/romney-this-is-not-the-barack-obama-we-thought-we-knew/" target="_blank"> Obama's highest ambitions</a> tells you a lot about the man and his mission. &nbsp;So I must ask: &nbsp;the millions who adore Obama--are they just as bent on doing evil as he is? &nbsp;Would the kill their own infants for fun and convenience? &nbsp;Or did they just fail to ask themselves, "do I really want my country's face to be the face of a killer-by-proxy?"</p>
<p>And for those who still claim to<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2209136/?from=rss" target="_blank"> honor heroes</a>, how do you view a man who wants to kill babies, but must<a href="http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/348569.aspx"> pay his own daughters</a> to do it for him?</p>
