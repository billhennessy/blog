  content: 'AMEN!!  While I don''t care for some of your vulgar wording, I agree with
    your thoughts.  I''ve been struggling with the "Do you want BO to succeed" question,
    and I feel guilty that my answer is the same as yours:  I hope he - and his agenda
    - fail miserably but that our country somehow survives.'

<p>Bill Clinton began his presidency in a recession, promising to make a middle class tax cut and more jobs his laser-beam focus. &nbsp;But first, he let gays into the military and sent his wife off to socialize medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barack Obama began his presidency during a borderline depression, promising to save the country from economic collapse, lowering the seas, and scripting quality endings to Stephen King's movies. &nbsp;But first, he symbolically flipped off <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/20/about-that-race-based-benediction/" target="_blank">everyone affected</a> by Islamofascist terrorists,<a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/281532.php" target="_blank"> snubbed military heroes</a>, and<a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2009/01/geithner---ethi.html" target="_blank"> redifined ethics</a> as the way one behaves when the whole world's watching.</p>
<p>Good government, like good medicine, begins with refraining from inflicting damages on the patient--in this case, the American people whom Obama theoretically serves.</p>
<p>If his first day and a half are any indication of the way he intends to rule (and I mean "rule"), then he is certain to go down as our first despotic president. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suspending Terror Trials and Closing Gitmo</strong></p>
<p>I am trying not to be angry. &nbsp;Nothing would be served by calling the President of the United States a smug, arrogant, communist, mutherfuker who isn't fit chew the used toilet paper of the lowliest Purple Heart recipient. &nbsp;So I won't do that. &nbsp;Nor would it help to remind readers that Obama has espoused communist doctrine for at least a decade. &nbsp;So we'll skip that. &nbsp;And would purpose would be served in pointing out that Obama would have been creamed in the primaries were he not half black? &nbsp;None. &nbsp;So I won't do that. &nbsp;Nor will I point out that the NAACP might have taken exception to Rev. Billy Graham <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/20/about-that-race-based-benediction/" target="_blank">praying that the black man will embrace work</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What I will say is that Obama either hates the American people and all we stand for, or he is really, really stupid. &nbsp;The Gitmo executive orders will define his presidency. &nbsp;When a dirty nuke blows up in Manhattan or weaponized disease strains Kansas's hospitals, we will point to these two, first actions as the eminating documents of a new wave of terrorism. &nbsp;Will be both correct and justified in doing so. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Long 4 Years</strong></p>
<p>Should The One or any member of his Supreme Soviet stumple upon these pages, may they take away this bit of advice: if the economy is so bad, make that your first priority; if terrorists are so cool, you should have run on that message.</p>
<p>And while you're here, please tell the President that I, for one, hope his presidency is a miserable failure but that the country somehow survives.</p>
