  content: With the mounting job casualties, here's hoping SCOTUS either finds someone,
    somewhere, has standing to require BHO's birth certificate or fixes attention
    on a criminal indictment before he wins his War on Prosperity.

    For eight years, all Americans were expected to rally behind President Bush, or we would be considered unpatriotic.

    Now that we have a president of a different political belief, we now are being asked to accept from the right wing that hopes for failure is now the correct call to make.

    I say make up your mind.

  content: Mr Obama wants a new National civilian security force which he plans to
    be "powerful, strong and well funded." Why does he need a personal secuity force.
    Does he need his own security force to enforce his green goals - someone to watch
    over our individual carbon footprint - are we going to use too much oil or electricity
    - or are going to talk to someone about his desire to transform our country in
    a socialist empire and restrict our freedom of speech if we disagree with the
    party line.

  content: The House recently passed its version of a stimulus which includes a measure
    effectively nationalizing everyperson's medical records. The ability to seize
    your medical records is just the first step to the control of health care and
    then ultimately deciding what care is to be allowed and who is to receive any
    care. Under socialized medicine, demand for care always quickly exceeds the capacity
    to provide it. Soon some senir citizen will go to his local medical center where
    he will be told "you are just a white person and you are over 65. Go home and
    die. We do not have to take care of you".

  content: Everytime Obama gives one of his masterful speeches, people in the audience
    are shown crying,nodding clapping etc.. Meanwhile I'm watching the stock market
    "ups and downs" as orator Obama refers to them &amp; I am crying as well! My 401
    is shrinking by 20,30,40%! Maybe if I quit paying some of my taxes(honest oversight
    on deducting Colts season tickets + travel to &amp; from games) I could get a
    higher paying cabinet job!

<p>The Democrat National Congressional Committee has launched an online petition calling for<a href="http://cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=42616" target="_blank"> sanctamony</a> directed at radio giant Rush Limbaugh. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why not me? &nbsp;I wrote "&nbsp;I, for one, hope<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2009/01/21/obama-to-america-fk-you/" target="_blank"> his presidency is a miserable failure</a> but that the country somehow survives" <em>before</em>&nbsp;Limbaugh spoke similar sentiments. &nbsp; I started the Campaign to Hope Obama Fails; Rush is a Johnny-come-lately. &nbsp;A fair-weather fan. &nbsp;He's probably a big Steeler fan all of a sudden, too. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The next the Democrats feel the need to decry divisiveness, please send them to me. &nbsp;I need the traffic.</p>
