<p>January 28, 2009, could go down as <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/28/today-was-a-good-day-for-conservatism/">the day conservatives regained their focus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What the FOCA</strong>?:&#160; Some enterprising pro-lifers desiring limited government launched the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.whatthefoca.com/">What the FOCA</a>?&rdquo; website.&#160; The site kicks some of the 1973-style slogans from the Right to Life movement, updating themes and memes for 2009.&#160; A great idea, long overdue.&#160; Visit often and donate generously if fighting rampant abortion is one of your action focuses.</p>
<p><strong>A (Republican) House United</strong>:&#160; Every member of the Republican House Caucus voted against <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/01/28/house-vote-on-stimulus-imminent/">Obama&rsquo;s Crap Sandwich</a>.&#160; The bill passed, of course, with all but 11 Democrats voting Aye.&#160; But the real story is that the consequences of this pile of Number Two land squarely on The One and his Girl Friday, Nancy &ldquo;Blend the Babies&rdquo; Pelosi.&#160; Remember this in 2010. </p>
<p>In 1981, many, many Democrats crossed the aisle and voted for Reagan&rsquo;s tax cuts.&#160; They knew that the strategy would work.&#160; Most were old enough to remember that Jack Kennedy did the same thing with success in 1963.&#160; Later, when Democrats tried to distance themselves from that vote, Reagan gently reminded the voters that Dick Gephardt and his colleagues rose in support of Reagan&rsquo;s first two budgets.&#160; They may share in their success, but they cannot say they opposed the bills.</p>
<p>When the economy tanks after a 3-4 month break (as I&rsquo;ve been predicting since October), the GOP can say, <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/toby_harnden/blog/2009/01/29/hollow_victory_republicans_deliver_slap_in_the_face_to_barack_obama">&ldquo;we told you so.&rdquo;</a>&#160; </p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s More Conservative Than an Onion</strong>?: The answer is, of course, <a href="http://www.theendive.com/">The Endive</a>.&#160; This ingenious and hilarious new satire site equals The Onion in quality and surpasses in originality.&#160; Sid Bridge, editor-in-chief, exemplifies Zen Conservatism by focusing on a single goal:&#160; pillory liberals with laughter.&#160; <a href="http://www.theendive.com/">Bookmark The Endive</a> and email your friends.&#160; This will become THE satire site of the Obama administration. </p>
<p><strong>CNN Ends Pretense of Objectivity</strong>:&#160; CNN is selling a sickening, sycophant T-Shirt with prominent banner ad.&#160; I honestly cannot believe that they have stooped to this.&#160; I defy anyone to argue that a wholly partisan press benefits a free country.&#160; I&rsquo;m thinking of blocking cnn.com on my home firewall to prevent my kids from reading this crap.&#160; Anyone else up for it?</p>
