    in about two years. \n\nhttp://davidappell.blogspot.com/2009/02/january-rss-temperature-anomaly.html\n\nAnd
    five of the last six months of surface temperatures have been warmer than the
    year before."

<p>The GDP might have contracted 5.4 percent annualized in 4Q08, but the AGW industry contracted about 50 percent in one week:</p>
<p><strong>Hansen&rsquo;s Boss</strong>:&#160; James Hansen, AGW&rsquo;s Father of Lies, received an insulting, public rebuke from his old boss at NASA.&#160; In essence, <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/27/james-hansens-former-nasa-supervisor-declares-himself-a-skeptic-says-hansen-embarrassed-nasa-was-never-muzzled/#more-5352">Dr. John Theon</a> of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, accused of Hansen of violating basic scientific principles, NASA&rsquo;s scientific methodologies and policies, and of embarrassing the agency with his anti-scientific screeds on global warming.&#160; Theon&rsquo;s emails portray Hansen has a fraudulent liar.&#160; (Where have you heard that before?")</p>
<p><strong>More Scientists Turn Skeptics</strong>:&#160; The parade of scientists who doubt Hansen, Gore, and the whole AGW theory never ends.&#160; This week the world&rsquo;s foremost authority on scientific forecasting, <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/28/forecasting-guru-announces-no-scientific-basis-for-forecasting-climate/#more-5370">Dr. J. Scott Armstrong</a>, declared that the IPCC&rsquo;s global warming documents have no basis in science and violate 72 specific principle of scientific forecasting.&#160; As the founder of the largest forecaster certification body, Armstrong effectively pronounced the IPCC invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Gulls in Massachusetts</strong>:&#160; <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15881227/">Arctic gulls returned to Massachusetts</a> for the first time in over 100 years, validating AGW-monger fears that climate change would alter the migratory patterns of animals.&#160; Unfortunately for the AGW people, this migration change came about because <em>the earth is getting cold, fast</em>.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Gore Effect</strong>:&#160; <a href="http://planetgore.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzMzMTA3M2E2MTcwZjA0MDEzZGJlODEzNzc4YjNlMjQ=">Al Gore testified</a> before the Senate in Washington.&#160; The weather cooperated.&#160; Snow and ice and record low temperatures blanketed the Eastern half of the United States.&#160; </p>
<p>The job of conservatism is not to attempt science, but to look for political bias in purportedly scientific claims.&#160; The AGW hysterics are based exclusively on political goals:&#160; the elimination of human freedom.&#160; Don&rsquo;t let them win. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to challenge your friends and co-workers to repeat the lies they hear from James Hansen and Al Gore and Michael Mann.&#160; Your friends might not have the educational advantages you&rsquo;ve had&mdash;perhaps advanced degrees in prestigious universities destroyed their critical thinking skills.&#160; It&rsquo;s up to us to help them. </p>
