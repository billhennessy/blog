<p>Well, at least communism&rsquo;s brightest symbol:&#160; piles of mattresses. </p>
<p>In this case, Obama&rsquo;s politburo wants to buy and crush new cars and trucks.&#160; Yes, GM and Chrysler and Ford can produce all the cars and trucks they want.&#160; Since the public won&rsquo;t buy them, the government will&mdash;and crush them.&#160; <em>Crush</em> them.&#160; I kid you not.&#160; This from <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/01/unreal-stimulus-includes-government.html">Gateway Pundit</a>:</p>
<p>Democrats want to include a new car crushing plan in the "stimulus" bill where the government would buy <em>new</em> cars and trucks that obtain less than 18 mpg and crush them</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering about he mattresses, Ronald Reagan liked to tell the story of a Russian mattress factory.&#160; The central planners in Moscow gave the plant manager a higher quota every year.&#160; By the 1980s, the quota was so high that the quality of the mattresses became abysmal.&#160; The plant&rsquo;s allotment of raw materials was the same or lower than it had been in 1970.&#160; The output, then, became smaller, thinner, and will less of everything.&#160; In other words, it was junk wrapped in cotton.</p>
<p>Since no one would use these mattresses and since the factory produced more mattresses each year than Muscovites could consume in a century, and since the factory was denied a request for a truck, the plant manager had no choice but to stack the mattresses in the streets surrounding the factory.</p>
<p>It was amidst these 10-story piles of decaying mattresses on a cold Moscow day in November that Soviet Premier Yuri Andropov presented to the mattress factory manager a medal to commemorate his 20 years of meeting quota.&#160; </p>
<p>Liberals will never understand the irony, of course, and conservatives will never understand why liberals love over-production so long as the government is the producer or director.&#160; Waste is waste.&#160; In fact, waste is a sin&mdash;the sin from which liberals absolve themselves in advance.&#160; </p>
<p>Peggy Noonan, one of American&rsquo;s best writers when conservatism is in the minority, brilliantly dissects the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123326587231330357.html">Democrat pork-barrel bill</a> in yesterday&rsquo;s Wall Street Journal.&#160;&#160; She missed the car crushing provision.&#160; But in a bill written by Democrats, for Democrats, and of Democrats with no input from the other side, there is more crap than one human could possibly digest.</p>
<p>Tell your Senator&mdash;D or R&mdash;to stay away from Obama&rsquo;s first piece of legislation.&#160; The new president is a long way from ready for the office he now occupies.&#160; </p>
