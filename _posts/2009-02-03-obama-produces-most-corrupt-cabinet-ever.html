  content: Today explains why the "Prez" has surrounded himself with all of the liars
    and cheats that he has.  It used to be customary for ALL politicians to lie, but
    only when their lips move, and hope that we wouldn't see them move.  Now we have
    the "Commander and Thief Liar" blatantly doing it, only hiding in his inner office
    when he so sneakishly signed the bill with all of the "Pork Barrel" Spending that
    he said he would not allow.  I am sick of ALL the liars in DC and it is time we
    sent every Damn one of them packing right on back to the states they came from.  THEY
    ARE EXPENDABLE they do have SSAN

  content: Prediction Obama will be impeached, maybe even being accused of treason
    before his reign ends !! There is know question in my mind that we are looking
    at the beginning of a race war, started by the lunatic fringe in the White House,
    Van Jones was the beginning of the end for this guy, Acorn is another, the list
    go's on and on and on ! The civilian army this guy is talked about are the ex-convicts,
    that have many muslims amongst them, most of course would love to start the war
    they think will bring the Great Satan to it's knees, and of course the cop haters
    ! Why do you think Cass Sunstien was just approved, this nut wants to ban hunting
    and give Bambi the right to sue us ! What will Bambi want in restitution, thats
    right our guns, maybe the MIB will come knocking on my door some day ! But something
    tells me these guys won't be coming to arrest me for sedition, but to protect
    me and others like me who still believe in the right of free speach, and for the
    love of American for which we stand.....

<p>We on the right chided Obama supporters who claimed The One was ready for the Oval Office.&#160; Clearly, we were wrong:&#160; Only a seasoned, veteran politician could assemble a team of liars, frauds, cheats, hypocrites, and criminals as broad and deep as Obama&rsquo;s cabinet. </p>
<p><strong>Daschle&rsquo;s Hubris</strong></p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s set up some context.&#160; Here&rsquo;s what your soon-to-be Health Socializer said about tax cheats on the <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/02/&ldquo;make-no-mistake-tax-cheaters-cheat-us-all-and-the-irs-should-enforce-our-laws-to-the-letter-&rdquo;/">floor of the Senate in 1998</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Make no mistake, tax cheaters cheat us all, and the IRS should enforce our laws to the letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daschle&rsquo;s evasion of taxes, though, was treated with leniency throughout.&#160; Daschle used his power as a former Senator and the power of his friends in high places to dodge the IRS.&#160; His charade would have lasted forever had he not accepted a cabinet post.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Geithner&rsquo;s Mental Retardation</strong></p>
<p>Timothy Geithner is the new Secretary of Treasury, which oversees the IRS.&#160; Geithner is a Harvard grad who claims to be mentally and educationally incapable of understanding the US tax code.&#160; His tax evasion appears to have been criminal, and only his access to government power prevented his prosecution.&#160; If Geithner is admittedly too stupid to do his own taxes, why in the name of God would anyone put him charge of the IRS?&#160; How stupid does that make Obama?&#160; How incompetent does that make Harvard.&#160; (Remember, Harvard produced almost all of the geniuses who destroyed the US banking system.)&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Honor Among Socialists</strong></p>
<p>The root of Obama&rsquo;s problem is not <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/02/02/audio-hannity-wonders-why-democrats-dont-pay-taxes/">corruption of the usual variety</a>; it&rsquo;s his zeal for collective socialism.&#160; In the old Soviet Union, party officials could not be tried for corruption, only for treason.&#160; In Obama&rsquo;s America, fellow-travellers needs only avoid threats and challenges to his power.&#160; In Obama&rsquo;s world, Al Capone was fit for Secretary of the Treasury so long as he vowed to end capitalism, but Mother Teresa was a criminal for opposing infanticide.</p>
<p>Obama is proving as dangerously communist as we all feared in September.&#160; In fact, he may be moving faster than we suspected.&#160; </p>
<p>It looks as though only the Second Amendment can save the Tenth.</p>
