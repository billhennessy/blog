    I love it...all this with the liberal base screaming, "Palin has no experience!!!"

    Right now, liberal America deserves what it put in office.

  content: This article is a joke due to these facts. The so-called experience of
    an Iraq war based on faulty intelligence of Iraq having WMD, the absolute lie
    that supposedly Saddam Hussein was in league with Osama Bin Laden and the Al Quaeda
    network, the highly misguided attempt to establish democracy in a region that
    has known nothing but fighting for well over a couple thousand years (remember
    democracy didn't happen in this country overnight, and this is a federal republic)
    the abandoning of the fight against the true perpertrators of 9-11 and their Taliban
    allies, the disappearance of the surplus as it melted into insane deficits and
    debts, the so-called party of fiscal discipline on whose watch made all this mess
    complains of democrat control of the senate, the house, and the white house while
    seeming to forget that prior to the elections in 2006, they themselves held the
    same amount of control including the Supreme Court. I did not vote for President
    Obama like millions of other Americans because like millions of other Americans,
    we would've voted for Sen. McCain if he wasn't running in the name of your failed
    policies.  The Presidential Candidate McCain of election year 2000 would be president
    now if he didn't go awhoring after the failed policies that you all have set.
    Now all I can do is hope that the new administration doesn't fail.  People like
    yourselves fail to recognize that even though Americans are forgiving we don't
    forget what was being spoonfed to us. I just feel sorry that our military and
    ordinary citizens have to pay the price for your ignorance and arogance.

    To Beole:

    Please keep your comments on topic.  Your opinion of the Bush administration's decisions, or how much you like McCain, has nothing to do with this article.  The current topic is Obama's leadership skills - or rather, lack thereof.  I knew that Obama would be a horrible president, but I must say that I am surprised that it is so blatantly obvious this soon.  I pray that our country is salvageable in 4 years.  Good article, Bill!

    I had to come back and see what kind of responses came over the wire for this one...gotta love how Iraq and WMD's always come up when liberals get hysterical!

    I'm doin' well, Bill.  Still ruffling liberal feathers, as usual.  I keep reading your blogs, love what I see!  The quasi-tea party here in Arizona rocked.  I only wish I coulda gone to some of the others.

<p>In the polite political banter between liberal and conservative co-workers this fall, a liberal friend trotted out that tiresome, perennial Democrat litmus test:&#160; &ldquo;They say the first act of a president is picking a vice-president; look how well Obama handled that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Okay. </p>
<p><strong>Obama&rsquo;s First Decision Was Disaster</strong></p>
<p>During the campaign, Joe Biden was a laughing stock, relegated to the safe, blue states where&mdash;Obama hoped&mdash;the press would ignore him.&#160; They did not.&#160; </p>
<p>The press dutifully reported the progeny of Obama&rsquo;s first presidential decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>Biden promised us a terrorist-driven disaster within 180 days of Obama&rsquo;s inauguration</li>
<li>Biden declared that Hillary Clinton would have been a better choice for vice-president</li>
<li>Biden declared that &ldquo;J-O-B-S&rdquo; is a three-letter word</li>
<li>Biden introduced Obama as &ldquo;Barack America&rdquo; after Obama introduced Biden as &ldquo;the next President of the United States&rdquo; IDIOTS!</li>
<li>Biden confused millions of school children and historians by reminiscing about FDR&rsquo;s television show in 1933</li>
<li>Biden chided a wheelchair-bound man to &ldquo;Stand up! Let &lsquo;em see ya.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the inauguration, Biden revealed that Obama gives Generational Theft Act a 30 percent chance of failure.&#160; </p>
<p>Last night, confronted with Biden&rsquo;s latest idiocy and breach of confidentiality, <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/toby_harnden/blog/2009/02/10/barack_obama_throws_joe_biden_under_the_bus">Obama slammed his VP</a>:&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>You know, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a slam on himself as well as a slam on Biden.&#160; Obama put Biden into this position.&#160; Had the president discharged his duties as a Senator instead of parlaying that office into celebrity, he might have gotten to know Joe Biden a little better.&#160; That Biden lacks a water bug&rsquo;s sense is well known in all of Washington.&#160; Biden is an idiot despite his amazing IQ.</p>
<p><strong>Talent Management Problems</strong></p>
<p>But Obama&rsquo;s talent management ineptness goes way further than that first decision upon which every candidate should finally be judged (according to liberals).&#160; <a href="http://www.californiaconservative.org/liberals/helluva-job-timmie/">Timothy Geithner</a> crashed the stock market today simply by speaking before the Senate.&#160; He clearly lacks the first clue of what to do about the economy.&#160; (<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/10/tax-cheat-wonder-boy-geithner-is-a-laughingstock/">Malkin</a> has more.) Other than warning Senators (and tax payers) that he will soon hit us up for yet another trillion dollars, he evaded every question.</p>
<blockquote><p>Administration officials were greeted with sarcasm and laughter Monday night when they briefed lawmakers and congressional staff on Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner&rsquo;s new financial-sector bailout project, according to people who were in the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, no, that quote didn&rsquo;t come from National Review.&#160; It came from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/10/administration-officials_n_165551.html">Huffington Post</a> (h/t <a href="http://michellemalkin.com">Michelle Malkin</a>).</p>
<p>Frighteningly, Geithner&rsquo;s evasions were not of the guilty sort (as in Clinton&rsquo;s testimony before the special prosecutor), but of the ignorant sort (as in &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a friggin&rsquo; clue what you&rsquo;re talking about Senator&rdquo;).&#160;&#160; No surprise:&#160; Geithner is less skilled than I am at figuring his taxes with TurboTax.&#160; </p>
<p>Other examples of Obama&rsquo;s horrible hiring record include Bill Richardson (indictments pending), the Performance Czarina (tax problems), and, of course, Tom Daschle (tax fraud and shakedowns.)&#160; Now Rahm Emmanuel might have tax issues, as well.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;F&rdquo; Word</strong></p>
<p>All of these leads some serious-minded people to ask:&#160; <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ebea1b8-f794-11dd-81f7-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1">Has Obama&rsquo;s presidency already failed</a>?</p>
<p>Expect Rush Limbaugh to re-release &ldquo;See, I Told You So&rdquo; shortly. </p>
