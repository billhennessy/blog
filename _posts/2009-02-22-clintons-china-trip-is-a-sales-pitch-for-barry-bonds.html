<p>Yesterday it seemed that Hillary Clinton's principal goal in China was to detach human rights from . . . well, from everything.&nbsp; Today's Washington Post reveals the real purpose of her trip:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/22/AR2009022200468.html">sales</a>.</p>
<p>Barack Obama has, in a month, made George W. Bush's deficits look like surpluses. And he or his cabinet members promise about another $1.5 trillion in direct debt before the fiscal year ends in September.</p>
<p>To finance this socialist expansion of government, Obama must sell bonds and lots of them.&nbsp; Much as war bonds fueled our efforts in WWII, these "Barry Bonds"&nbsp; are hoped to fuel the nanny state. </p>
<p>Last week, Ed Morrissey explained why he and others believe China has no choice but to <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/02/15/the-difference-between-owing-30k-and-3-trillion/" target="_blank">keep buying</a>.&nbsp; I'm not so sure.&nbsp; The debt China owns right now can garner a premium on the market.&nbsp; Combine that with the strengthening dollar, and you quickly see why China might want to cash out some of its US debt to build infrastructure in its own country.&nbsp; </p>
<p>China might also use domestic investment, financed by the sales of US Treasuries, to expand consumerism at home.&nbsp; The promise of a gigantic consumer market in the world's most populace country has failed to materialize.&nbsp; It seems to be the logical next step in China's financial maturation.&nbsp; </p>
