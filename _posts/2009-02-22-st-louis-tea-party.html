    Thomas,

    I understand.  I wanted to coordinate this with the Nationwide Chicago Tea Party whose organizers picked this Friday.  I agree that a weekend event would bring out more people.

    event... it's a 'no-show' for some of us who would otherwise be interested in
    going.,... some of us are still working to pay our mortgages :)

    the government using our hard earned tax dollars to do with whatever they want,
    all work for a living. Not so easy to attend on a Friday.

  content: "I understand that there will be two more Tea Party (or similar) protests:
    \ April 14 and July 4.  Both are on non-work days.  \n\nThis was just the first
    in a series to launch a movement.  I wish everyone could attend, but I know this
    movement will accommodate everyone before the summer's over. \n\nThe future is
    ours.  Your disgust with the borrowing and spending, your noble desire to restore
    the republic the founders wrought, those are the real protests.  The tea party
    is in our hearts and souls--the events are just the physical manifestations.  \n\nThank
    you for your desire to attend.  I will try to recruit two more people to represent
    you."

    administration.  Gatherings are allowed on Federal property (the west side of
    Wharf Street) but the National Park Service requires a permit.  It is easy to

  content: "So, this sounds exciting and I'm glad to see a swell of people supporting
    an end to wasteful government spending of the money it STEALS from the citizens.
    The federal government has no Constitutional authority to do 90% of what it does.\n\nThat
    being said, we also cannot simply ignore the fact that many so called \"conservative\"
    politicians(many with an \"R\" next to their name), participated in swindling
    the American populace out of $6+trillion under the Bush administration! Under
    the Bush administration, the size and scope of government thrived to levels that
    would make even Karl Marx blush. Those Republicans, who were complicit in the
    orgy of spending and big government greed, must be held responsible for their
    actions; and we must not merely go along with their anti-big government/anti-spending
    rhetoric now that they are out of power. To not look at the voting records of
    the politicians that reside in the the cesspool of criminality in DC would be
    very foolish if we ever wish to move forward as a country.\n\nWe need PRINCIPLED
    Statesmen in government; not those whose principles flutter in the wind! We need
    people who know and respect the Constitution and the rule of law. Not obeying
    the Constitution has led our country to the precipice of disaster and once we
    start picking up the pieces when it all comes crashing down, we need to get back
    to what made this country so conducive to liberty and economic prosperity. The
    government was meant to protect individual liberty from the mob rule of the majority
    and that's about it! \n\nAll that being said, I hope you are all committed to
    smaller government (which includes no Drug War, PATRIOT Act, REAL ID, barely any
    spending, etc) at all times and not just when the Democrats have power; nor when
    the Republican \"leadership\" issues an edict that infringes on individual liberty!\n\nNow
    let's brew some tea!"

    I would like to help.
    I attended at the ARCH and want to do more.
    We need a better speaker system or mega hailer.
    Dana was good but we need more in the way of loud ,big voiced people to whoop up the crowd.
    How can we nuild the crowd?
    This just can't be about the speding and taxation,you need to expand support for free speech and the right to defend our rights.

    yet called to verify my identity.  \n\nIf they don't call by today, I will post
    that letter here.  \n\nIn the meantime, there's nothing wrong with 1,000 or so
    angry people besieging gbailon@stltoday.com with your opinion of his editorial

    i know what your thinking, i am just a kid that knows nothing on the econimy,
    but you would be wrong on that. i know about how fannie and freddy were combining
    triple A rated mortgages with sub prime mortgages. i know how inflating the money
    supply to bail out the banks is a bad idea. there is a lot more i know that i
    want to tell the people. i want to show the people that even a 15 year old teen
    knows more than most buearocrats in washington. so please, give me a chance to
    speak. \n\nI await your answer,\nTravis Rolstead"

    In answer to the question asked you about what the Tea Party stood for other than being against everything, may I suggest that you ask the candidates to take the following:

    Pledge of Responsibility

    We the people of the United States of America do hereby ask our elected officials in Washington, D.C. to publicly take the Pledge of Responsibility to restore fiscal sanity to the country.

    1. Be it resolved that the Federal government will follow generally accepted accounting procedures in its financial reporting as the businesses and organizations of America do.

    2. Be it resolved that the Federal government will issue audited financial statements to the American people as the businesses and organizations the government regulates do.

    3. Be it resolved that the Federal government will sell or auction off asserts under its control that either can be operated by the private sector or for which the private sector should pay a fair market value to use.

    4. Be it resolved that each of the 535 directors of the Federal government plus the President and the Vice President will identify one program each that can be eliminated in its entirety as a pledge of their willingness to make the tough decisions and be it resolved that the funds saved will be used to reduce the deficit.

    5. Be it resolved that the Federal government will identify the core activities of the government and be it resolved that noncore activities will be discontinued, sold, or outsourced, as appropriate and be it resolved that the funds saved will be used to reduce the deficit.

    6. Be it resolved that the Federal government will review the operations of the core activities of the government to determine how they can be done more efficiently and be it resolved that the savings will be used to reduce the deficit.

    7. Be it resolved that the Federal government will institute no new taxes until it has demonstrated to We the People that it is capable of spending our money for the benefit of the country in a responsible and efficient manner.

<p>**Succinctly**</p>
<p>Hennessy's View has joined Top Conservatives on Twitter and is proud to help with:</p>
<p>St. Louis Nationwide Chicago Tea Party</p>
<p>Friday, February 27, 2009<br />
11:00 a.m.<br />
Foot of the Arch Steps on Wharf Street, St. Louis, MO, 63102</p>
<p>The official event sign-up page is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=67775481561">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=67775481561</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=67775481561"></a>Please, please, please show up in huge numbers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, and spread the word. &nbsp;We want our money back, dammit!</p>
<p>*****Original Post Follows*****</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Sorry this post is sloppy, but events are developing rapidly.)</p>
<p>**UPDATE** &nbsp;St. Louisans, listen to <a href="http://thedanashow.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Dana </a>Radio (<a href="http://www.971talk.com/" target="_blank">97.1 FM</a>) at 8:00 p.m. tonight, Sunday, February 22. Patrick Leahy of Top Conservatives on Twitter and Dana will discuss this Tea Party wave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I've started a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?sid=8fb0dbb65c1a39772fa0c2c39dc9d35c&amp;eid=67775481561" target="_blank">Facebook Group </a>to keep in touch.</p>
<p>***We now return to our regular blogging***</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2: &nbsp;Let's try to do this Friday, February 27, as part of a National Tea Party protest. &nbsp;Already more than 15 cities involved. &nbsp;Look here or on the Facebook page or follow #teaparty on Twitter for location and time.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 3: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?sid=7b1ffe1481bca8f1c3548f6414f33739&amp;eid=67775481561" target="_blank">Facebook event page </a>has all the details. &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.officialchicagoteaparty.com/form.html">National Chicago Tea Party Page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Michelle Malkin for popularizing the <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/21/tea-party-usa-the-movement-grows/" target="_blank">Tea Party Protest</a>.</p>
<p>Who's up for it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking March 14 before the downtown St. Patrick's Day parade.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Toss some tea into the Mississippi</li>
<li>Run 3.2 miles</li>
<li>Freeze for an hour</li>
<li>Drink some Jameson's and Mich Ultra</li>
</ul>
<p>If Seattle and Chicago can find enough patriots to oppose Obama's socialization plans, St. Louis sure can.</p>
<p>Track progress here, on Facebook's #dontgo group, or follow <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=dontgo" target="_blank">#dontgo</a> and <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=teaparty" target="_blank">#teaparty</a> on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, Look!&nbsp; Someone's written <a href="http://theconservativerevolution.com/freedomworks/how-to-organize-your-own-tea-party-protest/" target="_blank">a recipe for a Tea Party</a>.</p>
<p>How 'bout this;</p>
<p>Date:&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Saturday, March 14, 10:00 a.m.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday, February 27, 11:00 AM<br />
Where:&nbsp; Steps of the Arch, Wharf Street<br />
Bring:&nbsp; 5-10 friends, signs, and tea (but not in bags)<br />
