<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=67775481561" target="_blank">St. Louis Tea Party official event page</a></p>
<p>The list of cities with Tea Party protests scheduled for this Friday, February 27, is growing by the minute. I wanted to point out some important links and facts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=39436151621&amp;ref=ts" target="_blank"><strong>#TCOT</strong></a> and Patrick Leahy have done an outstanding job pulling this together in a very short time. [<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=39436151621&amp;ref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>]</p>
<p>Thanks to Bill Whittle and <a href="http://www.pjtv.com/?cmd=video&amp;video-id=1407" target="_blank">PJTV </a>who are doing an top job of covering the events.&nbsp; (I'll be a guest on Bill Whittle's upcoming show.)</p>
<p>I just heard from V<strong>incent David Jericho </strong>of <a href="http://www.ksgf.com/" target="_blank">KSGF</a> in Springfield, MO.&nbsp; He's rapidly pulling together an event in that city for lunchtime Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Be Effective</strong>.&nbsp; If you go to a Tea Party, please know the theme and talking points.&nbsp; Be ready to handle the media like a pro.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your event's Facebook page will have talking points.&nbsp; Pick your favorites and have them ready when someone asks why your at the protest and what you want to tell the President, Congress, and your fellow Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Watch the weather</strong> for Friday (or whatever day your Tea Party is scheduled).&nbsp; St. Louis is forecast to be 45 and cloudy, so please dress appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Bring tea bags</strong>, but please don't pollute.&nbsp; The tea leaves are bio-degradable; the bags and strings are not.</p>
<p><strong>Bring signs</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stimulate This!</li>
<li>Get Out Of My Wallet!</li>
<li>$2 Trillion and all I got was a tax increase</li>
<li>A trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon you're talking a real depression</li>
<li>Hope and Change looks a lot like Despair and Stagnation</li>
</ul>
<p>(Please post more ideas for sign slogans.)</p>
<p><strong>Have Fun</strong>:&nbsp; When was the last time conservatives took to the streets in cities all across America?&nbsp; We're standing for Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Lincoln, Reagan, even Kennedy.&nbsp; What would Buckley or Friedman or Ayn Rand say about these times and this legislation?</p>
<p><strong>Say it for them!&nbsp; Be their voices. </strong></p>
<p>Thanks, everyone, for digging in.</p>
