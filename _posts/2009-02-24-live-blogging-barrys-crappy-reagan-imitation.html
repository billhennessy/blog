<p>Ninety percent of live blog posts suck. &nbsp;So I did my blog readers a big favor: &nbsp;I tested my quips on Twitter. &nbsp;Here I present my instant reactions that were good enough to get retweeted. &nbsp;(You're welcome.)</p>
<ul>
<li>I wish he'd ask "the Democrat majority to ramrod one-sided legislation through Congress" just once.</li>
<li>BHO's funnier if you don't look at him, but Biden makes me laugh. What do I do?</li>
<li>socialized medicine! Reminds me--my license plates expire this week</li>
<li>If I'm ever prez, remind me to cure a bad disease in every speech</li>
<li>I miss the suspense of W sneaking up on "kazakishtan"&nbsp;</li>
<li>When will he thank China for making all this "investment" possible?</li>
<li>Read the 10th Amendment, Barry</li>
<li>When the hell did borrowing become the lifeblood of the economy?</li>
</ul>
<p>And the winner . . .&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to produce more solar power? I'm NOT financing a new Sun!</li>
</ul>
