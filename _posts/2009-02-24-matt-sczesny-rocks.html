  content: "I think my ancestors who were actually wounded in the Revolutionary War
    might be a bit upset that people who had never fought in a war were wearing red-painted
    gauze wrapped around their heads today. \n\nAlso, FYI, Ben Franklin started the
    nation's first publicly funded community hospital, offering health care to all
    regardless of ability to pay. He talks about it in his autobiography as one of
    his greatest accomplishments. I highly recommend Franklin's autobiography. It's
    excellent reading."

  content: "jaelithe,\n\nOn the gauze comment--I was a submariner. It doesn't bother
    me that Cary Grant honored submariners by playing one in a movie.  Even a comedy.
    \n\nI have no problem with a community funded hospital.  I want more of them.
    \ I don't want federally funded hospitals, though, because they are unconstitutional.
    \ They are not enumerated in Congress's powers, and the 10th Amendment prohibits
    the federal government from doing anything not required of it by the Constitution."

<p>Great coverage of the St. Louis Tea Party on KMOV Channel 4 by reporter <a href="http://www.beloblog.com/KMOV_Blogs/reportersblog/2009/02/the-st-louis-tea-party.html" target="_blank">Matt Sczesny</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Channel 4 has <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">not</span> posted the video (that I can find). <a href="http://www.kmov.com/video/topvideo-index.html?nvid=335682" target="_blank">&nbsp;I'll link or embed it as soon as it's available</a>.</p>
<p>Please say "thanks" to Matt and KMOV for a fair report.</p>

<p>Amy at Top Conservatives on Twitter has put together a convenient list of the <a href="http://tcotreport.com/MasterTeaPartyInfo.html">Tea Parties across the country</a>. &nbsp;This list is NOT exhaustive, as not all cities have a Facebook Event page. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have friends and family in other cities, please encourage them to attend their local rally. &nbsp;And remember, this is an exhibition, not a competition; please, no wagering. &nbsp;(h/t Letterman)</p>

<p>For our local St. Louis theme, I really, really like the <span style="color:#800000;">Red</span>: &nbsp;the blood of the patriots. &nbsp;We represent that vast stretch of land filled with strong, working people who rush to the shores when our Republic is threatened. &nbsp;We stand tall against enemies foreign and domestic. &nbsp;We bandage our wounds and march on, ever forward, ever humble, yet ever certain of our purpose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Red-stained guaze around our heads, red sweaters on our chests, the river at our backs, the Great Frontier before us. &nbsp;St. Louis was the far side of the America's Rubicon. &nbsp;All who travel there on Friday will set themselves on the trail to a future under the torch of our brilliant past. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Ben Franklin left Consitution Hall after the delegates had finally ratified the document that forever changed man's relationship to government, a citizen shouted, "Dr. Franklin, what have wrought us?" &nbsp;</p>
<p>Franklin replied simply, "A Republic . . . if you can keep it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>To hear our President doubt our steel, question our resolve, and deny our ability to right ourselves and help our neighbor without some immense government to guide us is to hear that Philadelphia citizen shout back at Franklin, "Can you keep it for us?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our red shirts tell Franklin, "Just watch."</p>
