<p>Go Dana. &nbsp;How 'bout a little equal time? &nbsp;Why does the WU prof get 80 percent of the time?</p>
<p>DELETED VIDEO EMBED</p>
<p>I detest videos that start automatically. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see the report on KSDK's web site. &nbsp;Not the best coverage, certainly not fair, but publicity is publicity. &nbsp;So thanks to Rebecca for visiting with Dana and selecting 7 seconds of the interview to air ahead of 30 minutes of some college professor who wrote a book in his spare time. &nbsp;(I wrote mine while I was in the Navy.)</p>
