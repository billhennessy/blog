<p>My light blogging owes to our efforts to change the world in a week.&nbsp; My role is, appropriately, miniscule.</p>
<p>When Congress listens, it will repeal the trillions of waste, fraud, and abuse it has produced over the past 4 months, it will stop proposed borrowing and bailouts, it will stop rewarding bad behavior in corporations and citizens, or it will <em>retire.</em>&nbsp; This time, there are no two ways.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image.png"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="255" alt="image" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb.png" width="388" align="left" border="0"></a> Using tools like Twitter, email, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=67775481561" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.tcotreport.com" target="_blank">TCOT</a> has provided at least 163 patriots a forum to voice its discontent on Friday, February 27 at 11:00 a.m. at the foot of the Arch steps in St. Louis.</p>
<blockquote><p>These citizens are coming out to tell Congress that we utterly reject its notion of borrowing its way out of debt, paying people and companies for failure, and building debt that must be paid through high taxes or high inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the past 24 hours, the House has spent $410 billion and President Obama has requested hundred of billions more for healthcare.&nbsp; When will it stop?</p>
<p>The stop starts on Friday.&nbsp; Join us.&nbsp; </p>
