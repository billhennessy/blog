    Bill &amp; Crew, thanks so much for organizing the first steps here in St. Louis.  I was glad to attend ("Party Like it's 1773" gal) and see there were so many others like me fired up and ready to make our voices heard.

    However, not all of us have Facebook accounts.  If you could post the Photobucket/Flickr links here on your blog for those of us not in the FB loop, it would be much appreciated.

    And keep us posted on future events.  I'd love to help organize.  Tax Day protest, maybe?

    BTW I'm the guy that shook your hand on the hill around 10:30 and thanked you for having the @3(($ to put this on! I will be at the next one with more folks in tow.

  content: I would hope that you would know that the Boston Tea Party was a protest
    against taxation without representation.  What you did today made no sense at
    all.  It was a huge waste of good tea.  May god help the city O&rsquo;Fallon,
    because if Hennessey is running the show it will be in trouble.

    Brad,

    First, thanks for coming down today even though you obviously didn't understand what we were saying.  I know these economics are difficult for some people to comprehend the first time they try.

    Second, I am not that Bill Hennessy.  And I don't spell my name that way.

    Cordially,
    WTH

    Bill,

    My family and I had a blast!  Thank you for all your hard work in getting this organized.

    BTW - Channel 4 or 5 lied and said there was only about 400 people there (I wasn't watching the television, my Libtard neighbor called me up to rub the inaccurately reported low number in my face).   That 400 number is an outright lie because I was counting and compared my numbers with two other people who were also taking count.  I had around 1500.  The other two had a few more than that.  The St. Louis Post Dispatch reported over 1000.

    It probably depended on when exactly the count was taken.

    Obviously, the television stations are trying to downplay it by reporting obviously wrong numbers. And, it seems to have worked on my Libtard neighbor... So, what else is new, eh?

    Cheers

    Would like a louder bull horn next time.  Couldn't really hear the speakers.
    And I agree with the comment above.  I don't have a facebook account and would like to be able to readily find out about other events without signing up for one.
    Thanks for your efforts today.  And thanks to the musician.
    And to the people who came with signs:  Great signs.  Great imaginations.  Great Americans.
    I was proud today to be part of this event.

  content: "Shirley, you and me both. That's my fault. I figured 50 people would success,
    100 would be magnificent.  When Dana told me she'd bring a megaphone, I appreciated
    it, but wondered if we even needed that!\n\nOne remarkable outgrowth of this event,
    which I will blog about later, is the closet conservatives who are telling me,
    \"Next, call me.\"  Some of these folks have direct access to the stuff we need
    for 1,500 strong events. \n\nThe signs were awesome.  I especially enjoyed the
    little girl with the \"Obama:  I need more toys--NOW!\"  and my buddy Bill Lux's
    Tax and Spend diagram."

    out there.  Do you know how she would hear of any rallies out there?  I recently
    was out there at a wedding, and I think met all the conservatives in California!\nThanks
    again!  Am looking forward to St. Louis' next rally. \nShirley"

    Shirley,

    I don't see one near Sacramento, but your friend can schedule one here:

    Bill,

    The St. Louis Tea Party is on the Drudge Report.  It links to the St. Louis Post Dispatch article.

    Cheers

<p>Thanks to the 1,000+ patriots who stood in the snow at the Arch, <a href="http://thedanashow.wordpress.com/">Dana "The Energizer" Loesch</a>, Doug Saur, the speakers, <a href="http://because-ihaveto.blogspot.com/">Michelle Moore</a> and Jeff who managed the fairgrounds, Desiree' the Poster Party Lady, and the true leaders at #<a href="http://tcotreport.com/">TCOT </a>who held my hand after I stumbled into this event. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9721" title="St.Louis 1000 Conservatives in 4 days" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/n1517255758_30223702_1100492-2-300x199.jpg" alt="St.Louis 1000 Conservatives in 4 days" width="300" height="199" />Today at the Arch in St. Louis was simple patriotic magic. &nbsp;I have to do some wrapping up of the event, but I'll say this:</p>
<p>America's future is not in the White House; it was on the steps of the Gateway Arch and dozens of other Tea Party locations today.</p>
<p>This was not an event; it was step in a march that ends with Repealing Pork by Retiring socialists.</p>
<p>The scene was simply unbelievable. &nbsp;Dana Loesch electified the crowd, and Hall of Famer Jackie Smith had them roaring. &nbsp;In between, American Issues Project President Ed Martin, conservative blogger Shamed Dogan, responsible mother and former candidate for State Senate Gina Loudon, and State Senator Lemke (sp?) &nbsp;sent a clear message that the 1,000+ adored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Republic will be in great hands. . . soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
<p>If you were at the St. Louis, event, upload photos and videos to Photobucket.com. &nbsp;See you Facebook messages for details.</p>

<p>Keep this movement growing; going isn't enough. &nbsp;Tell your friends to watch the news feeds, read the blogs, monitor #tcot. &nbsp;Don't stop. &nbsp;This wave won't crest until we have a conservative Congress, President, and SCOTUS.</p>
