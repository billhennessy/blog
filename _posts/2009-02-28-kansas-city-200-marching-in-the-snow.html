  content: "CONGRATS ON THE T-party. And NOW;\nA Call to Action        by  Average
    Man  2/17/09\n&ldquo;Im mad as hell and Im not gonna take it anymore&rdquo; This
    chilling yell from the movie Network was screamed from window after window by
    \ citizens fed up with a government  feeding them crap sandwiches. A government
    \ boldly flaunting  its arrogance and incompetence .That cry is as appropriate
    a display today as it was years ago in the movies.  But it is not enough. \nWe
    have a President who promised transparency , change  and hope just a few weeks
    ago, now preaching fear while increasing troop levels in Afghanistan and backpedalling
    on his promise to withdraw in 16 months from Iraq.  He tells us that the largest
    spending stimulus in history must be passed immediately with no time to even read
    the thing. Not exactly &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;.\nJust over a year ago, when
    the economic meltdown was becoming obvious, our Senate was holding public hearings&hellip;on
    steroid use in baseball. Now, amidst the most serious world economic meltdown
    in living history, there is serious talk from the government about Compulsory
    Civilian Service for our youth (a.k.a involuntary servitude without a declaration
    of war). I wonder what color will be their shirts.  \nGuns are flying off the
    shelves like hotcakes because the citizenry sees an assault on the constitution.
    New York&rsquo;s new senator supports the 2nd amendment since she went &ldquo;hunting&rdquo;
    \ as a child, but at last read, the word hunting did not appear in amendment 2
    ; And a concerted effort is underway to reinstate the &rdquo;Fairness Doctrine&rdquo;
    a most blatant and &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; assault on the 1st amendment if
    there ever was one. Limiting free speech in America! Who knew!  Our soldiers have
    fought and died to give you and you and you the  right to voice your opinion freely
    ; no matter how imbecilic it may be.\n  And so there is a movement to clarify
    the  10th amendment in over 20 state legislatures. That&rsquo;s the one that gives
    the States all powers not specifically granted to the federal government or prohibited
    by the Constitution . The States legislatures are wary of an over reaching central
    government, just as they were soon after 1776. They had no idea what was coming
    in the first decade of the 21st century!  \nWith a one party government ; and
    I do not mean  the Democrats controlling all 3 branches, I mean all of government
    being controlled by politicians and bankers and lobbyists.  Well maybe big media
    is in power too, from Fox to MSNBC and the print media that all provide just what
    it is they want us to know when they want us to know it. Oh, there is just enough
    difference between them to keep us busy while the men behind the curtain put the
    final nails in our country&rsquo;s coffin.  Riots in Europe, bankrupt countries
    like Iceland&hellip;shhh&hellip;don&rsquo;t tell the people of America&hellip;they
    might get ideas&hellip;BTW: how&rsquo;s our Bunker construction going?  What was
    that Sen Reid said about the &ldquo;smell&rdquo; of constituents?\nThe party makes
    little difference, that is a false dichotomy, a red herring to keep us focused
    while the real action is taking place in secrect; behind closed doors.The people
    have no say at all. Five hundred to one were the calls to many Congressmen  at
    the end of the last administration saying &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  bailout the banks&rdquo;,
    we know how much influence that futile effort had on political decision making.
    After all, these pols don&rsquo;t worry about re election anymore, not in any
    big way, the Senate is filled with Legacies. You know , father to son Senate seats,
    Senator dies, wife gets seat, Senator becomes VP, seat is held open for son to
    come back from war. Senator becomes Sec&rsquo;y of State, Unelected Governor appoints
    new Senator. Give me a break; this is not America! You will be shocked when you
    look that up.\nI truly believe that the Government is taking Rahm Emanuels advice,
    to let no crisis become a missed opportunity, or some such tyrannical thing. BUT
    I THINK THEY ARE MOVING ON THE PEOPLE TOO SOON.  \nWe WILL be awakened. WAKE UP
    you people;  no one is as blind as one who does not see. \nThis is a CALL TO ACTION:\nGo
    to the kitchen and get pots and pans and go outside . Tonight.  Right At midnight
    . Tonight. And every night.\nGo to your car, your truck,. GO TONIGHT  Go Every
    night. Go get your noisemaker, go to your yard, tonight . Right At Midnight. Tonight
    and every night at Midnight. BANG YOUR POTS AND PANS. BLOW YOUR DAMN HORN, MAKE
    SOME DAMN NOISE. \nLet everyone know that you are mad as hell and will not take
    it for long."

<p>More than 200 hearty patriots marched through driving snow and 20 degree temps in Kansas City today as part of the ongoing Tea Party Protest.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the organizers and demonstrators.&nbsp; You're simple act of rebellion against Obama's socialist power-grab is a noble statement of your intent to preserve and defend our Republic.</p>
