    First of all thank you for taking the first step to get these protests going!

    My biggest problem is I didn't know about this, or I would have been there as well.  May I suggest a grass roots campaign on FaceBook, MySpace, and other social networking sites?  Again - I know I would have been down there along with five friends (who said the very same thing).

    than those who showed up who are angry but couldn't make it :).
