    I started following your blog, after the Tea Party that you organized. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!
    I think that you were put in the right place at the right time. You have no idea  how many of us are waiting to do ANYTHING at all to change what is happening around us. We can only write so many letters to our congressman and argue facts until we start to feel discouraged.
    Friday I felt FREEDOM!! I'm one of those scaredy cats that does not like to speak my mind around liberals. They are flailing to get dirt to throw on us, because we protested with little $ and no major funding. WE THOUGHT FOR OURSELVES. Thousands and thousands of us all over the nation - on a weekday, while our significant others worked or took off work to be there!

    Nothing warms my heart more than watching a liberal get uncomfortable.

    Thank you Bill for this opportunity to join you and other patriots to take back our country. The one that I love so dearly. I'm truly excited for our future and am proud to be able to stand with such incredible people.

    See you on Tax Day!

  content: "Bill, First of all thank you, and Dana for organizing a combined voice
    for conservatism. This post has expressed my feelings to the letter and I am so
    impressed by the voices that have joined together to take back their country.
    I drove 3 hours to be a part of a united voice. It was an honor to stand at the
    side of ALL of the patriots at the Arch.\nI'm tired of trying to find just the
    right words to respond to liberals. Just the right words are \"I AM WE THE PEOPLE!!\"
    \nMy daughter sent me some the hoax accusations last night and my immediate thought
    was that they're squirmin. They're uncomfortable with this out of character uprising
    of Conservative America. They're grabbin at anything to define it. But I can help
    them out and define it for them, \"WE ARE WE THE PEOPLE!\"\nThey're just going
    to have to let go of the throat of our country -- because we're comin' through!\nI'm
    on the front lines with you with deaf ears for the liberal zombies. I'm fed up
    with their loud-mouthed hatred, I'm fed up with the entitlement whining, I'm fed
    up with the bogus racist fist pounding, I'm fed up with the pelosism mindset of
    government takeover. \nI enjoyed reading the panic stricken liberal prediction
    that the enthusiasm would pass away. Yeah, just keep thinking that. We've been
    suppressed for 30 years under their BS. Uh-huh, there's no pressure built up or
    anything...\nI'm in for the long haul!! \nSee you on Tax Day!"

  content: I also just wanted to thank you for pulling this together. If there's one
    good thing that has come out of Obama running for office is that I've become totally
    involved in the conservative movement. Before that I really didn't pay too much
    attention to politics (too busy raising twins). I'm here for the long haul &amp;
    I'm up for the fight. Thanks for giving us a voice.

  content: "The hard part is finding a voice which is heard over those who want to
    quash any momentum.  Will the Daily Show use the tea parties tonight as a joke?
    \ Look at the campaign directed at Rush Limbaugh since Saturday.  \n\nWe need
    candidates for office with the guts to talk over the prominent media who believe
    it is their job to protect the current administration and parrot the talking points
    they receive each morning from Rahm Emmanuel.  We don't need representatives who
    feel they have to placate the opinions of the media."

  content: Bill, you are awesome!  Thank you for your leadership in this!  I wish
    I could have joined your tea party.  (I used to live in St. Louis, but I now live
    5 hours away.) Anyway, keep up the great work.  I pray this movement continues
    to awaken and grow.  Conservatives are taking back America!  Let's roll!!

<p>Here's an example of the kind of emails I've been getting since Friday's Tea Parties:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope you don't mind me bugging you about this but I've been trying to find a group to get involved in that understands that some people have principles and they don't believe government is the answer to the mess we are in. I would really like any information you have on getting connected with like minded people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or the half-dozen people who approached me on the Arch grounds in St. Louis Friday and said, "I've been afraid to speak up.&nbsp; I was afraid people would ridicule me or my job would be threatened.&nbsp; When I saw this, I realized I can finally speak my mind."</p>
<p>Liberal America has waged a 30-year war on free speech in which the only acceptable speech is that which perpetuates liberal lies, slanders conservatism, denigrates the United States, accuses our Armed Forces, ridicules Judeo-Christian values, or vilifies business owners. </p>
<p>ENOUGH!</p>
<p>I don't care what liberals think about my views anymore.&nbsp; I won't go out of my way to pick a fight, of course, but I'm not going to let lies go unchallenged. </p>
<p>I'm sick of living in a country where children are taught to steal from people who have a higher income than they do.&nbsp; I'm fed up with whiny welfare ladies and lords demanding more confiscation from some to benefit others without an ounce of work.</p>
<p>If ACORN put half the energy into productive labor that they put into demanding other people pay their way through life, they'd be richer than Bill Gates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Health care is not a friggin' right.&nbsp; A right is something you'd have if you were alone an island.&nbsp; There you could say anything you want, build the hut of your dreams, kill the beasts that roam the land and the fish that swim in the sea and lagoon.&nbsp; You could make a rule for yourself that you will rise with the sun each morning, write 10 filthy words in the sand on the beach, and drink 18.5 fluid ounces of the ale you've learned to brew using native grasses and grains.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the things you lacked comprise that enormous body of that which IS NOT A RIGHT!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Our government was instituted BY US to ensure that we remained as free as if we were the ONLY PERSON ON THE ISLAND.&nbsp; On the island, you wouldn't have free health care except for that which you practiced yourself.&nbsp; You wouldn't have a free home except the one you built yourself.&nbsp; You wouldn't have a free car unless you managed to build one yourself.&nbsp; You wouldn't have a court to sanction a gull for his mocking reproaches that offend your self-esteem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Because our founders understood that other men are far less likely to encroach on your freedom and is government, they gave us Constitution that sets out a very small number of specific tasks which government may perform, forbidding the government from doing anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the 10th Amendment then Article 1.&nbsp; You'll start to get it.</p>
<p>And no group has a moral right to steal things from one of its members, even after a fair and democratic vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine if your co-workers took a vote at lunch and decided that you'll pay the entire bill no matter what anyone ate. They're justification, "You had a vote, Phil.&nbsp; It just didn't go your way.&nbsp; Buck up and pay for our lunches." </p>
<p>But Congress does just that.&nbsp; It votes to force some people to pay for other people's lunches!&nbsp; You cannot justify it.&nbsp; You can't.&nbsp; Smarter people than you have tried and they've failed utterly.</p>
<p>So knock of the entitlement crap and the whining about the rich.&nbsp; The rich got that way because the spent less than they earned.&nbsp; Tough formula, huh?&nbsp; If you make $100, spend $80.&nbsp; Next time do the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; And again and again and again. Pretty soon you'll have a POSITIVE NET WORTH.&nbsp; With America's savings rate and marginal propensity to consume over the past 20 years, you only need about $100 to be considered rich!&nbsp; </p>
<p>The next time you hear someone say, "The government should do this; why doesn't the government take care of that?" speak UP.&nbsp; Respond!&nbsp; Say, "You are the friggin' government, honey, why the hell don't YOU do something about it? If it's so damned important, then why do you wait for some mindless bureaucrat to fix it?&nbsp; Get off your miraculously spreading rump and take care of it yourself."</p>
<p>And one more thing for you lying bastards in the national media and the idiots who parrot everything you say:&nbsp; I didn't even have time to tell my sisters, cousins, nephews, or even my WIFE about this Tea Party thing it happened so fast.&nbsp; I was minding my own damned business last Sunday --something you lefties know NOTHING about--when I decided to put out feelers about having a protest against government spending.&nbsp; So many pissed off people said, "I'm in" that I had no choice but to take my own advice and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT MYSELF!!!!.&nbsp; We conservatives don't have government bureaus we can go to to stop government stupidity.&nbsp; We have to take matters into our own hands.</p>
<p>And after a week of working 50 hours and organizing a protest on 12 hours sleep in 5 nights, you ignorant bastards accuse me of a) being a friggin' billionaire and b) planning this thing for 2 years!&nbsp; Hell, we got 1,500 people marching in 4 days!&nbsp; If I had 2 years, we'd have taken over Congress!&nbsp; </p>
<p>And we damn well will take over the Congress in 2010, so help me God!</p>
