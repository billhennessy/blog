<p>The immediacy of our challenge in defending the Republic against Barack Obama's socialist,one-world ambitions reached new levels over the weekend.</p>
<p>*UPDATE: &nbsp;The eminent domain story appears to be a hoax. &nbsp;My apologies. &nbsp;I found it on several blogs that are generally reliable, so I assume the hoaxter is good at his craft*</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Eminent Domain Rights to China*</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">First, as Hennessy's View has predicted for months, the rate and size of US borrowing has reduced Uncle Sam's credit worthiness.&nbsp; China will no longer finance American overspending on America's word and has demanded collateral.&nbsp; The President of the </span><a href="http://www.blufftontoday.com/node/27498" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">United States offered</span></a><span style="text-decoration:line-through;"> </span><a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2009/02/obama-grants-eminent-domain-rights-to-american-land-to-china.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">eminent domain</span></a><span style="text-decoration:line-through;"> rights as collateral.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">If the United States is unable meet the terms of its bonds, </span><a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0f8_1235673139" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">China will take over American land</span></a><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>*CAUTION: &nbsp;I should have read more carefully. &nbsp;This is an unnamed source. &nbsp;There's been no named corroboration since story first appeared on 2/28. Repeat with caution.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminating Private Charity</strong></p>
<p>Second, following Saul Alinsky's manifesto for turning the US into a communist country, Obama's budget begins the process of eliminating private charities in the United States.&nbsp; The budget calls for limiting the deductibility of charitable donation for the top 5 percent of income earners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Top earners fuel America's churches and charities.</p>
<p>This should not have surprised me.&nbsp; Leftist think tanks, like the <a href="http://www.ssireview.org/site/printer/a_failure_of_philanthropy/" target="_blank">Stanford Social Innovation</a> Project, have pushed for elimination of private charities for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Theses veiled communist front groups believe that only government--and only government by those of their ilk--can properly allocate money.&nbsp; The fact that the government is six-times less efficient than private charity at getting money to the needy notwithstanding.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.generousgiving.org/page.asp?sec=4&amp;page=161" target="_blank">Generous Giving</a>, a foundation that tracks philanthropy trends, households with incomes above $300,000 annually give 4.4 percent of their income to charity, while those below give just 2.3 percent.&nbsp; This disparity is exacerbated by the the fact that 4.4 percent of $400,000 is a lot more than 2.3 percent of, say, $150,000.&nbsp; Moreover, the vast majority, about 70 percent, of all charitable donations come from individuals and families.&nbsp; By capping donations from the wealthy, Obama hopes to wipe our religious and other private charities, leaving government as the sole provider of relief.</p>
<p>Obama's Aim is Socialism</p>
<p>Ceding American soil to Red China and eliminating private charities are only two of Obama's long list of tactics in his war against our republic.&nbsp; But they are chilling and powerful reminders of the urgency of our quest to keep America free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patriots who believe that governments are instituted among men and derive their just powers from the consent of the governed should take a deep breath and prepare to fight, to sacrifice, to face scorn and ridicule.&nbsp; The American left will come after you.&nbsp; But the voices of the men and women who died and suffered to bring to life this grand experiment in self-government will haunt the weak and the timid who choose comfort over truth.</p>
<p>Let's begin with an 80 percent turnover in the House of Representatives in 2010.&nbsp; The next Tea Party rallies will be April 15.&nbsp; Give up that one day for your country.&nbsp; Do it in the names of those who gave up all their remaining days for your freedom.&nbsp; Do it in the names of our children and future generations who deserve to breathe the fresh air of the American republic.&nbsp; Do it for your church and your family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
