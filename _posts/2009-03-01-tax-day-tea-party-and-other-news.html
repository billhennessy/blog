  content: "I understand the symbolism of tax day, but isn't the Danger of a Smaller
    turnout too high to try our luck again on a Day during the Week?\n\nMaybe we can
    have in on the 12th and tie it in to Jefferson's Birth day on the 13th as well
    as tieing it in to Tax Day?\n\nThat way we will probably get a Good turnout, possibly
    bigger than before and we can tie it to a Founding Father who was an advocate
    for Limited Federal Goverment and low taxes.\n\nAlso on April 12, 1770 the british
    Repealed the Townshed Act except for the Tea which led to the Boston Tea Party.
    \ Could we not use this as well to Tie in the Date for April 12th?  \n\nUsing
    a Slogan like:\n\n\"Follow the British Example in 1770!  Repeal the Stimulis!\"\n\nOr
    Something along those lines....\n\nI know I can't make it on the 15th and I fear
    alot of others won't as well. I just hate to see the Cause Die early due to a
    Modern day sybolism...especially when we have plenty of Historical Symbolism available.\n\nThank
    You for your Consideration\n\nPatch"

    Forgot a few... April 19th is the Anniversary of the "Shots heard around the World."  The day the Minute Men fought the British at Lexington, Concord and all the way back to Boston.

    Or April 18th the Ride of Paul Revere.....


    Just a Few more Dates that would help tie in the return to a Constitutional Government.

    Thanks Again

  content: Is bill hennessy the pervert on craigslist or is it a friend of his who
    flags post stopping free speech. Yes folks the pervert slanders people and I think
    there is a connection with this sick individual and bill hennessy.I can see why
    the republican party is now down to a 21 percent poll rateing, people now see
    what they stand for.

    Folks go to craigslist political board and look at all the post from Monday and Tuesday of this week. See for yourself how a sick individual connected to if not bill hennessy has slandered a persons deceased parent his post titled tranny whore should be very interesting for you to read.I can see why Arlene Specter has left the rep. party along with over 200,000 people from Pennsylvania who joined the Democrats.The pervert on craigslist political board a short time back was bragging about hennessy being his friend then bill should stop this asshole from posting garbage before I do because my stopping him will be a permanent situation.If this doesnt do any good I will start posting about hennessy on Nation sites.
