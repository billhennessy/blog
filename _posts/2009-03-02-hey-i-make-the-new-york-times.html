    Congrats!  I saw the article this morning and came over here to let you know.  But, you beat me to it!  LOL

    BTW - There was a photographer from the New York Times who was taking photos at the St. Louis Tea Party.  Why am I not surprised that they didn't use his photos?

    Cheers

  content: Bill - congrats! I expected it to be a hit job, but luckily you didn't
    get the usual NYT treatment of conservatives.  (Can't say the same for Santelli.)
