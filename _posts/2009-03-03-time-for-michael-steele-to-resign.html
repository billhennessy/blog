  content: Steele is a true disappointment.  We lived in MD/DC for 35 years and, when
    he was Lt. Gov. of MD, he spoke a different message. At first blush, you may have
    the impression that he has abandoned his principles. Clearly, he has abandoned
    NOTHING, but is simply showing himself for what he really is - a carpetbagging
    member of the GOP, otherwise known as the Gutless Old Party.

    Steele is just playing politics. Unfortunately, he's not doing it very well.

    In a one week period, he managed to piss off both Rush Limbaugh's fans and Republicans who support civil unions for gay folks. Whether or not you're a Rush fan, whether or not you oppose civil unions, it's easy to see that Michael Steele is alienating Republicans by the millions at a time when we need to grow and strengthen the base.

    I supported Michael Steele's candidacy for RNC chair, but he's starting to look like a loose cannon and the Party can't afford that right now.

    If the GOP disbands, it will splinter into two or more weaker parties with no top dog emerging before the 2010 elections, so I don't think that's the answer.  We've got to work with what's in place, ousting people who aren't working for the people and promoting those who are.

    This is more than about Rush.  When the liberal talk show host said that CPAC looked like a bunch of Nazis Michael Steele nodded in agreement.

    Some said his nodding wasn't in agreement with that statement but still at the very least he was quiet and did not speak out against that outrageous statement.

    This is more than about Rush the person. This was about the speech he gave and if you listen to the speech and agree with it then it is not only Rush but YOU, that Micheal Steele has rebuked in the harshest of terms.

    Well, if that is the way the "leader" of the GOP feels about me then I say no, no,no, not God Bless the GOP, GOD DAMN the GOP. It isn't the party I thought I knew!

    I was so happy when Steele was voted in and made his first act firing the entire RNC staff, purportedly to replace them with *true* conservatives.

    Now I'm pissed at him.  What a tool.  Earth to Michael Steele: when someone likens you to a Nazi, you tell them to go to hell!

<p>When Republican Congressmen and -women are more conservative than the party chair, it's time for a new party chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Micheal Steele took his seat and immediately alienated conservatives, the backbone of the Republican party. &nbsp;By attacking Rush Limbaugh, Steele attacked one of the few people in the US with the courage to speak the truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For five years, Democrats have prayed -- PRAYED -- that Al Qaeda in Iraq would defeat the US Military. Yes, John Murtha, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, and the rest of the Democrat party rooted for our enemies and cheered American military deaths.</p>
<p>Steele was silent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when Rush Limbaugh rightly states that Obama should fail in his attempt to turn the United States socialist, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19517.html" target="_blank">Steele attacks Limbaugh</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steele is spineless. &nbsp;Let's call him Michael Tinfoil.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's time for the Republican party, itself, to disband. &nbsp;The guilty white men of the GOP have given us a series of failed candidates; they have exiled conservatives; and they have abandoned their bounden duty to preserve and defend this republic. &nbsp;While in charge of the C'ongress, they spent like drunken Democrats. &nbsp;Since losing power in 2006, they have continued to hijack Democrat policies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some conservative once lamented that if the Democrats introduced legislation to burn the Capitol to the ground, the Republicans would offer a counter measure to phase the fire in over 5 weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Steele would light the match. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's time for Steele to resign.</p>
