  content: "This is just one of the many things we have to look forward to, but with
    that said I find it all rather mind boggling especially with the UN Treaty that
    they want to pass, it kind of goes against what they're trying to accomplish here....\nthis
    is taken from the Preamble \n\nBearing in mind that, as indicated in the Declaration
    of the Rights of the Child, \"the child, by reason of his physical and mental
    immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection,
    BEFORE as well as after birth\", \n\nI capped the BEFORE because personally I
    think that is a good thing, probably one of the few things I would agree with....There
    is evil everywhere you look and unless we are willing to take a stand, and I am
    so glad you said EVIL because that is what this is all about.  GOOD and evil...Right
    and Wrong.... people who believe in GOD and those who don't. Those are the underlying
    points of everything we are seeing going on.\nI would invite all to read the UN
    treaty, while it has been around for quite a while there are those in power now
    who believe in this treaty and want it passed.  Hilary and Obama both are for
    it....this is just the beginning. Great Post and thanks for your hard work at
    keeping us informed!\n\nHere is the link\nhttp://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/crc/treaties/crc.htm"

<p>The Freedom of Choice Act, the most sweeping suppression of religious dissent ever considered in the United States, is poised to pass in Congress.&nbsp; This legislation will put the U. S. government on a collision course with the Catholic church that could fundamentally alter the relationship of the government to religions forever.</p>
<p>The Freedom of Choice Act would make it a crime for a hospital, nurse, doctor, or technician to refuse to take part in abortions.&nbsp; In other words, acting on one's moral belief would be grounds for arrest, trial, and imprisonment. </p>
<p>If Barack Obama signs this bill, which he co-sponsored as a Senator, every Christian who believes abortion is tantamount to murder will have no choice but leave the medical profession.&nbsp; Moreover, Christians will be compelled to actively seek the political emasculation of Obama through a sweeping overhaul of Congress in 2010. Anything less would constitute moral cooperation with evil.&nbsp; </p>
<p>U. S. Catholic <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/religion/story/E6E47067257DB95E862575710014DD57?OpenDocument" target="_blank">Bishops said in November</a> that they will <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/03/catholic_hospitals_might_close.html" target="_blank">shutter 624 Catholic hospitals</a> if the bill becomes law.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><p>"It would not be sufficient to withdraw our sponsorship or to sell them [hospitals] to someone who would perform abortions," Bishop Thomas Paprocki said. "That would be a morally unacceptable cooperation in evil."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think the Tea Party-ers are furious, wait until you see the protests inspired by the most evil legislation every passed in Congress and signed by a president.&nbsp; I cannot avoid comparing the Freedom of Choice Act to Hitler's final solution of the Jewish "problem."&nbsp; </p>
<p>The blood-thirst within the Obama administration is palpable.&nbsp; They not only want every possible baby to die, they want to compel everyone to participate in one. Again, from the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/religion/story/E6E47067257DB95E862575710014DD57?OpenDocument" target="_blank">Post-Dispatch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After Sebelius' nomination, HHS hinted that it would soon repeal another Bush administration rule &mdash; enacted in December &mdash; that allowed health care professionals to opt out of providing abortion or birth control procedures on moral grounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another era, Sebelius would hunted down in the streets for gleefully destroying the human life and for forcing the innocent to participate.&nbsp; Seriously, people, this is so evil that it would have made for an implausible movie plot just 20 years ago.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Two sponsors of the bill are St. Louis's own cowardly congressmen, Russ Carnahan and Lacy Clay.&nbsp; Neither "man" would talk to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporters about the bill.&nbsp; Because they're cowards!</p>
<p>See if they open their mouths when 11 St. Louis area hospitals close rather than cooperating in evil.&nbsp; </p>
