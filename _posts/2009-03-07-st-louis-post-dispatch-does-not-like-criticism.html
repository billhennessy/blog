<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch was once a powerful, respected cornerstone of the Pulitzer publishing company.&nbsp; Today, it's little more than a community newspaper.&nbsp; Some near-tomorrow, it will go the way of Rocky Mountain News.&nbsp; Its demise can be traced in large measure to the arrogance of its editorial board.</p>
<p>Take Eric Mink.&nbsp; This is a man who rose through the organization by leveling unfair, nearly libelous attacks on anyone who deviated from Mink's party line.&nbsp; In the early 1980s, when Mink was already over his head writing about television, he launched an attack against Douglas Leonard, then head of programming for KETC Channel 9.&nbsp; Mr. Leonard's crime was preempting a Nova episode of KGB, anti-Reagan propaganda.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This week, Mink's thin skin exposed itself in his editorial, "St. Louis Is Not Conservative."&nbsp; Mr. Mink's sole criterion for measuring conservatism is, of course, election results.&nbsp; In Mink's little mind, conservatives vote Republican, and liberals vote Democrat.&nbsp; To "prove" his point, Mink gerrymandered a statistical lie, weaving together 12 counties in the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri region which, added together, voted Democrat in their presidential votes in 2000, 2004, and 2008.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also this week, the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/the-platform/published-editorials/2009/03/tea-party-bring-food/all-comments/#comments" target="_blank">Post attacked the thousand-plus people</a> who attended the Tea Party Protest at the Arch.&nbsp; An unnamed editorial the people who gathered to preserve and defend our Republic of selfishness.&nbsp; Editorial board member, Eddie Roth, went even further in his denunciation of our protests.&nbsp; First, Roth extended the paper's accusation of pure greed against those who protested on February 27.&nbsp; Then Roth proclaimed that we protesters are imposters to the conservative creed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I also think that true conservatives recognize the dissonance of staging a rally in these times in which the chant, essentially, is &ldquo;me, me, me, me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We shall see.&nbsp; Mr. Roth, it seems, subscribes to the sick and twisted notion that only government can save us now.&nbsp;&nbsp; He ignores the fact that every step the government takes makes matters worse.&nbsp; Did the Wall Street bailout in September prevent a 6.2 percent GDP contraction in October through December? No.&nbsp; Did the stimulus pork stop the stock market from falling another 20 percent?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Did Obama's socialist budget stop the market from reaching mid-1990s levels?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Has the government arrested the acceleration in joblessness?&nbsp; No. </p>
<p>Mr. Roth may pray on bended knee before the alter of Big Government until his pants rot; I will march alongside my fellow patriots and conservatives and small business owners until Washington Repeals the Pork and its authors Retire from public life. </p>
<p>With great assistance from Ed Martin, I have submitted a response to that editorial and to Mr. Roth's little tantrum.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
