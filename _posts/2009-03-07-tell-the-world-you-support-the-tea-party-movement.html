  content: "I hope the Americans who begin to follow the American Tea Party activity
    realize they are putting themselves in danger, ultimately.  While it's all kinds
    of fun to talk tough about the President and various politicians, never forget,
    they have the guns.  In order to socialism to prosper at the expense of productive
    Americans, the political leaders will need to get guns out of the hands of the
    average American.  I expect to see this come about slowly, first by raising the
    tax on ammunition and on firearms, then through enacting a laborious registration
    law.  HR 45 is one such step.  The provisions of HR 45 will allow the federal
    govt to enter and search the home of any gun owner without that resident's consent.
    \ This search will be an \"inspection\" to make sure the gun owner has properly
    secured his guns so they can't be stolen or played with by children.  In addition,
    the legislation will allow the federal govt to order a mental evaluation of any
    gun owner to ensure the owner is right-thinking.  \n    Again, the parties are
    fun, but realize your name will be sought by govt agencies if you become too vocal.
    \ Just as our founding fathers understood, you threaten the power and plans of
    the central govt at your own peril."

    While I share your concern about erosion of 2nd Amendment rights, I believe HR 45 confines inspections to businesses that manufacture and sell firearms.:
    <blockquote><strong>SEC. 403. INSPECTIONS.</strong>

    In order to ascertain compliance with this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the regulations and orders issued under this Act, the Attorney General may, during regular business hours, enter any place in which firearms or firearm products are manufactured, stored, or held, for distribution in commerce, and inspect those areas where the products are so manufactured, stored, or held.</blockquote>

<p>Cafe Press has dozens of shirts, stickers, and mugs that let you tell the world you belong to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/stlouisteaparty.com/tax-day/" target="_blank">Tea Party Movement</a>.</p>
<p>The lefties proudly wear their Che t-shirts and those idiotic coexist bumper stickers.&nbsp; Conservatives shy away from Public Displays of Protest.&nbsp; </p>
<p>NO LONGER!</p>
<p>While we're brewing up some St. Louis-flavored Tea Party logos, grab the generics now.&nbsp; You're kids will thank you some day.&nbsp; </p>
