<p>Tonight on "The O'Reilly Factor," liberal journalist Juan Williams sided with O'Reilly and Bernard Goldberg&nbsp; in ripping the left-wing smear machine.</p>
<p>"It's real, and I'm a victim of it.&nbsp; I have the scars to prove it," Williams told O'Reilly.</p>
<p>The left-wing smear machine includes The New York Times, Daily Kos, and others.&nbsp; As Goldberg's forthcoming book, "A Slobbering Love Affair," points out, this smear machine is a loosely but skillfully orchestrated consortium of radical, anti-American organizations that seeks, not just win at the polls, but to eliminate conservatism and Constitutional government.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What you can do stop them:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Doubt everything you hear or read in the liberal media.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Debunk the discredited global warming (now, climate change) propaganda.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Read and understand the Constitution as written and as affirmed in state legislatures.&nbsp; (Ignore what the Supreme Courts says about it.)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Join the <a href="http://taxdayteaparty.com/teaparty/" target="_blank">Tea Party movement</a> and attend the Tax Day Tea Party in your area on April 15.&nbsp; (Find an event in your&nbsp; area <a href="http://www.taxdayteaparty.com" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; If there is none, start one today.)</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Write letters to the editor challenging every article and editorial that promotes socialism, liberalism, or that attacks Judeo-Christian tradition.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Teach your children.&nbsp; Even if you do not home school, you owe it to your children to ensure they know the truth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Challenge "polite" liberal lies.&nbsp; "We all have to do something about global warming."&nbsp; "Only the government can save the economy."&nbsp; "The Republican ideas didn't work."&nbsp; They're all lies.&nbsp; Don't them hang out there.&nbsp; Be polite but firm.&nbsp; "What makes you say that?" will make the speaker think.&nbsp; If the lies come from a confirmed lefty, ask, "Who told you to say that?"&nbsp; </p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Get over the anti-bumpersticker mentality.&nbsp; Conservatives, libertarians, patriots need to identify themselves.&nbsp; We are <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics2/23_think_government_represents_will_of_the_people" target="_blank">EVERYWHERE</a> but we hide our beliefs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Fight <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.1da91b565bedacc6461ea17550408182.661&amp;show_article=1" target="_blank">Barack Obama's Army of National Socialists</a>.&nbsp; He's organizing it right now.&nbsp; He's recruiting your children.&nbsp; And that army will come after everything you have.&nbsp; If you don't stand up against him and them, they will come down hard on you and yours.</p>
<p>Finally, there's nothing wrong with hoping Obama fails in his mission to turn the US into a socialist country.&nbsp; As his poll numbers fall, he will make more mistakes.&nbsp; Drive down his poll numbers.&nbsp; This isn't personal; it's the business of preserving our Republic.</p>
