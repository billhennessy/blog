    PLEASE....have all attendees send out e mail "chain letters" opposing the current spending plans.  I developed and sent out a chain letter 2 weeks ago that asked everyone to call their US Senators (all  the Washington Senate tel#'s were at the bottom of the note by State) and then forward the note to at least 2 other people.  I am just one person...but what would happen if thousands all sent out similar notes.??  Washington would be flooded with a tidal wave of protest calls. I wish someone  speaking at one of the Tea Parties would take up this idea and sell it to all those attending. You could take down their e mails at the protest rally, and then send each and everyone a "starter" chain letter.  Please write me if you want a copy of mine for reference.
     Sincerely   Kin Carmody

<p>We&rsquo;ve launched <a href="http://www.stlouisteaparty.com">stlouisteaparty.com</a> to keep non-facebookers up-to-date on the Tea Party movement in St. Louis.&#160; </p>
<p>The Tea Party is a grassroots movement that will overthrow Congress in a ballot box revolution in 2010.&#160; It gives voice to the silenced conservatives who have been told &ldquo;shut up and pay your taxes&rdquo; by administrations and Congresses R and D. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve found our voice.</p>
<p>Tonight I watched Glenn Beck&rsquo;s 912project.com launch with a hundred patriots.&#160; Many of them are Vietnam veterans whose love of country is unequalled even by my dad&rsquo;s WWII generation.&#160; They refuse to keep quiet any longer.</p>
<p>Please visit the site, comment, and come to Kiener Plaza on the evening of April 15.&#160; It&rsquo;s Tax Day, and you PAID for this protest! </p>
<p>Others gave their lives for it. </p>
<p>Honor them with a generous heart and loud voice.</p>
<p>Bring food for the needy&mdash;trucks will be there to take your generous donation.</p>
<p>And God bless you and the great nation you help build every day. </p>
