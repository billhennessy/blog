<p><em>*Originally posted February 15, 2009*</em></p>
<p>I know this is a little late, but I was waiting for Congress to spend another trillion dollars or so before committing my prediction to the public.&nbsp; Here goes:</p>
<p><img src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phYB9CAhk8DHd4DCloxLuOg&amp;oid=1&amp;output=image" alt="" /></p>
<p>GDP and unemployment will &nbsp;flatten and even improve a bit in first half of 2009 for a couple of reasons:</p>
<p>First, people will begin to look for excuses to spend money.&nbsp; This includes businesses.</p>
<p>Second, the hideous transfer of power from individuals to government that passed Congress on Friday will have a psychological effect on people making some believe that things will get better soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, let's call this mass hypnosis.</p>
<p>That hypnosis, though, will wear off when we begin dissecting first quarter 2009 numbers in April.&nbsp; The reality will then hit home:&nbsp; downward economic trends slowed or reversed because things couldn't get much worse.&nbsp; (Again, this is the psychological feeling, not economic reality.)&nbsp; In other words, people will stop thinking "It's getting better," and start thinking, "We're stuck on bottom."&nbsp; It'll be like old WWII submarine movies where the disabled sub settles on the ocean floor.&nbsp; The crew's not out of the woods--oxygen will run out eventually--but they've stopped descending toward collapse depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, of course, some idiot seaman rolls a bowling ball toward the bow, a rock they're sitting on gives, and the sub starts sliding into 38,000 foot trench.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other economic bowling ball that will hit the pins in early summer is Treasuries. &nbsp;With the uptick in private sector activity and the flood of Treasuries hitting the streets, investors--<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aP7DPb6vb0Eo&amp;refer=worldwide">especially China</a>--will shift their purchases away from government debt. &nbsp;This will drive up yields quickly until equilibrium re-establishes. &nbsp;I don't know what the level will be, but it will be high. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Having obligated over <a href="http://www.myprops.org/content/U.S.-federal-obligations-of-65.5-trillion-exceed-world-GDP/">$65 trillion</a> (with a "t") in promisory notes since September, the US government must issue massive amounts of bonds. &nbsp;If you're a bond salesman with crateful of US Treasuries, a weak economy is a wonderful thing--there's nothing else for investors to buy. &nbsp;But a growing economy makes Treasuries, which are now riskier than ever before, a less attractive alternative. &nbsp;Stocks and corporate bonds offer the possiblity of recovering some of the losses of the 50 percent stock market dive. &nbsp;Treasuries do not. &nbsp;Not until their yields hit the 12 percent range.</p>
<p>High interest rates will cause already skiddish companies to pull back even more, touching off a new round of layoffs and another dive in both stocks and GDP. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, I'm just a computer guy; I could be wrong.</p>
