<p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll" target="_blank">Rasmussen's</a> daily Presidential Approval Tracking numbers continue to show that Obama has lost more support in his first 50 days than any president since polling began.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image.png"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="484" alt="image" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb.png" width="557" border="0"></a> </p>
<p>Among the many factors contributing to Obama's falling popularity, in my view, is his <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/4991247/Barack-Obamas-aides-admit-errors-are-making-him-less-popular.html" target="_blank">scattershot</a> approach to the economy, inability to recruit and retain talent, and strong leftward lurch since taking office.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Americans do not want socialism. I hear over and over from disenchanted Obama voters that they didn't believe he was a leftist as some on the right made him out to be during the campaign.&nbsp; But now they realize we were right, as usual.</p>
<p>Rasmussen has <a href="http://rasmussenreports.predictify.com/p/rasmussenreports/q/what-will-barack-obamas-approval-index-be-on-april-2?results&amp;prd=1" target="_blank">an interesting new interactive poll</a>:&nbsp; What will Obama's approval rating be on April 30?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
