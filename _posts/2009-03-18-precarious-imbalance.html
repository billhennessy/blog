<p>There&rsquo;s some sort of kid&rsquo;s trick in which a spoon balances improbably&mdash;seemingly impossibly&mdash;on someone&rsquo;s nose.&#160; <a href="http://bindinestor.wordpress.com/2007/03/31/the-spoon-trick/">Or something</a>. You&rsquo;ve seen it, haven&rsquo;t you? Of course, it only works while you hold your head up straight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s America today.&#160; In the leadership vacuum created when the left eviscerated George W. Bush in 2006, America&rsquo;s precarious imbalance seems improbable.&#160; Impossible.&#160; </p>
<p>Perhaps it is.</p>
<p>Likely it is.</p>
<p>AIG people get bonuses and people are ready to tear down the AIG building.&#160; Obama and Geithner apparently knew all along but feigned outrage when you, the people, found out.&#160; I&rsquo;m sure Obama&rsquo;s mad at himself, too, for taking $101,000 bonus from AIG last year, just as he took $148,000 from <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Fannie-plans-bonuses-of-up-to-apf-14679491.html">Fannie and Freddie</a>, both of which are about to reward their executives with bonuses.&#160; </p>
<p>Christopher Dodd snuck in a provision to permit AIG to award the bonuses that enraged the President.&#160; Then, according to CNN<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/03/18/dodd-you-know-now-i-remember-adding-that-bonus-language/">, Dodd lied about it</a>.&#160; When CNN calls a Democrat Senator a liar, there&rsquo;s no need for a jury trial.&#160; </p>
<p>Add to these outrages Obama&rsquo;s $2 Trillion tax increase on energy and manufacturing, most of which will be siphoned off by the government, redistributed to Obama&rsquo;s base, and whatever&rsquo;s left used to fund other socialist initiatives.&#160; </p>
<p>Add to cap-and-trade Obama&rsquo;s confirmed plan to make heroes wounded in battle pay for their own medical treatment.</p>
<p>Add to that another $1.2 trillion that, today, the Treasury Department heaped atop $69 trillion of government debt and obligations.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that multitudes are preparing to take to the streets on Tax Day to protest the bailouts, the borrowing, and the Bolshevism of Obama&rsquo;s socialist revolution.</p>
<p>Add all these things, and more, together and you get . . . </p>
<p><strong>REVOLT</strong>.</p>
<p>The American people are on the verge of full rebellion.&#160; Doctors are preparing to quit their profession in droves, the Catholic church is preparing to shut down almost 1/3 of the nation&rsquo;s hospitals, the American Legion is conducting its most vocal rebellion against a sitting president ever, school teachers are ready to overthrow their administrations. </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t economic unrest; this is the start of a revolution that could get really ugly really fast.</p>
<p><strong>Blame liberalism.</strong></p>
<p>Liberalism told us&#160; that we&rsquo;re entitled to a free lunch.&#160; Liberalism told us that others owe us everything we want.&#160; Liberalism told us that some unnamed &ldquo;rich&rdquo; bastard is killing our kids, screwing our wives, beating our dogs, and selling crack on the street corner.</p>
<p>Liberalism lied, and you poor, ignorant bastards who listened and obeyed are about to find out and hard.&#160; </p>
<p>No one living in America today, I&rsquo;m pretty sure, knows what hyperinflation is like.&#160; But we can read about it.&#160; It sucks.</p>
<p>No one living in America today knows what civil war is like in a country still full of really tough, rich, heavily armed people.&#160; But we can imagine thanks to the movies.</p>
<p>No one living in America today knows how this will end.&#160; But we&rsquo;ll be in tears before it&rsquo;s over. </p>
<p>The time to choose is coming.&#160; The choice is stark, simple, and moral.&#160; On one side stand those who live to enslave.&#160; On the other side, those who would die for freedom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still time to pull enough to the side of freedom that the forces of slavery rescind their immoral pursuit of power.&#160; There&rsquo;s still time for the freedom lovers to capitulate and lay their necks on the block.&#160; But not much time. </p>
<p>I hate these moments, but they are, after all, why we&rsquo;re here: We&rsquo;re here to choose light or dark, good or evil, freedom or slavery, obedience or sin, God or Satan.</p>
<p>The other side doesn&rsquo;t believe so much in God and never bought the idea of Satan.&#160;&#160; The other side just can&rsquo;t see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s head is pitching forward.</p>
