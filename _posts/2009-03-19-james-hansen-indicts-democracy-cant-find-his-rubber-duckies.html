<p>James Hansen told some idiots who are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/mar/18/nasa-climate-change-james-hansen" target="_blank">bored enough to listen</a> to the world's foremost global warming fraudster that democracy is destroying the planet.&nbsp; This is the James Hansen who's been cooking NASA books for a decade to try to cover his 20-year-old error about CO2 and global warming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2008/12/23/missing-arctic-rubber-duckies/" target="_blank">90 rubber ducks</a> that NASA dropped on Greenland glaciers to track the speed of melting have never made it to the sea.&nbsp; According to our great NASA scientists, the ducks should have emerged in December, 90 days after they were dropped.&nbsp; It's been 180 days, and the ducks are still frozen on Greenland.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To NASA, this means that someone stole the ducks.&nbsp; To everyone else, this means that glaciers on Greenland are melting at half the speed NASA expected.&nbsp; The experiment is disproved.</p>
<p>Your tax dollars at work. </p>
