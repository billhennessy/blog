    'Put it all together and it&rsquo;s safe to say that Al Qaeda accomplished a lot more of its goals at the ballot box last November than it did with the 9-11 attacks.'

    Wow you really are pandering to a select few with this. You claim being conservatives means being more patriotic then others. How is this statement fit in? It's patriotic to bash the President when you don't like him? Ever hear about the shoe being on the other foot?

<p>The new Secretary of Homeland Security has replaced the word "terrorism" with "<a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/284583.php" target="_blank">man-caused disasters</a>."</p>
<blockquote><p>I did not use the word "terrorism," I referred to "man-caused" disasters. That is perhaps only a nuance, but it demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that appointing an idiot like Napolitano to the cabinet qualifies as a man-cause disaster.</p>
<p>On that note, Eric Holder said that he intends to <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/03/19/ready-to-welcome-your-friendly-neighborhood-gitmo-terrorist/" target="_blank">free Gitmo terrorists in the US</a>.&nbsp; Obama hopes to isolate Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Put it all together and it's safe to say that Al Qaeda accomplished a lot more of its goals at the ballot box last November than it did with the 9-11 attacks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Congrats, Osama.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/03/19/obama-reaches-iran-looks-engagement/" target="_blank">Obama LOVES Iran</a>.&nbsp; And makes fun of the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/19/obama-tells-leno-stunned-aig-bonuses/" target="_blank">Special Olympics</a>.&nbsp; (He was teleprompter-challenged.)</p>
<p>Hey, Christo Buckley--how does it feel to have voted for the destruction of Western Civilization?</p>
