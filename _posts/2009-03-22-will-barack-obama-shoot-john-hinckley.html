  content: "Barack Obama is slipping the tentacles of government and the poison of
    entitlements into every part of American society, thereby ensuring that when he
    wants to go even further, he can serve up AIG's \"too big to fail\" canard.  When
    the credit markets continue to flounder, when the jobless rate edges into double
    digits, he will tell Americans that government has pumped so much money into the
    economy that we can't stop now or it will be all for naught.  \n\nSo many people
    assume Obama's administration has the best of intentions - they just can't mentally
    process the idea that an American leader would preemptively destroy generations
    of American wealth to advance a political agenda.  But the stimulus and spending
    and sweeping legislative changes aren't a bitter pill we have to swallow to get
    better; they are a virulent pathogen that must neutralized before the vision of
    our founders is nothing but a distant memory."

<p>The speed with which Barack Obama has seized&mdash;is seizing&mdash;private enterprise amazes even radical conservatives like me. Quite honestly, I am losing confidence in anyone&rsquo;s ability to stop him from making the United States into a hip version of the old Soviet Union.&#160; In his first 100, Barack Obama will have transformed the US government, completely erasing Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s presidency&mdash;as it the 80s never happened.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/us/politics/22regulate.html">New York Times</a> piece gives a great example.&#160; This week, Obama will seize power to approve, reject, or rewrite private employment contracts.&#160; In other words, business people no longer work for their boards, but for the federal government.&#160; Reagan&rsquo;s ideal of limited government&mdash;shared with Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Washington, and countless other founders&mdash;has been more than reversed.&#160; </p>
<p>Then there was the Iran video in which Obama essentially capitulated to the world&rsquo;s largest terrorist state.&#160; While Reagan&rsquo;s mere presence in the Oval Office frightened the Ayatollah into submission, Obama gave the present regime new legitimacy and power.&#160; For its part, Iran said, &ldquo;Let us finish our nukes and obliterate Israel.&rdquo;&#160; Obama has not said &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Obama&rsquo;s budget is not a budget but a down-payment on true socialism of the Soviet-bloc, not UK, type.&#160; His <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/03/less-than-100-days-into-administration.html">deficits</a>, funded with inflationary policies at the all-powerful Treasury department, will continue the economic crisis permanently, allowing him to tell us that &ldquo;only government can save us now.&rdquo;&#160; Can wage and price controls be far off?&#160; </p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/history/2009/03/12/the-first-100-days-reagan-pushed-his-agenda-of-tax-cuts-and-less-government_print.htm">first 100</a>, Reagan reversed the massive and rapid growth of government intrusion into our lives.&#160; Reagan&rsquo;s results and methods were so effective that even Democrat Bill Clinton happily signed into law a sweeping reform of entitlement programs 10 years later.&#160; In less than 100 days, Obama has restored the socialist dream to Washington, devaluing hard work, thrift, and individual liberty.&#160; </p>
<p>One wonders if Obama will put the finishing touches on his anti-Reagan motif by shooting John Hinckley Jr. on March 30.</p>
