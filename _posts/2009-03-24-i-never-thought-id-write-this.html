    "I try not to say or write [sic] what I really thing about our President.  It isn&rsquo;t Christian."

    Don't worry about it. You clearly ain't a Christian.

    You just "thing" you are.

<p>I try not to say or write what I really thing about our President.&nbsp; It isn't Christian.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But when we were dating, my wife gave me the best advice I've ever received:&nbsp; If you really want to cut someone down, say at least one good thing about them, and make it sound sincere.&nbsp; For that reason, I keep in mind that Barack Obama is a fantastic communicator.</p>
<p>Until tonight.</p>
<p>He sucked.</p>
<p>And he sucked on 60 Minutes and on Leno.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What did I never think I'd say?&nbsp; Obama is a terrible communicator.</p>
<p>It's as if he spent his whole life preparing to run for president.&nbsp; And that's it.&nbsp; He's done.</p>
<p>I'm offended when people compare Obama to Reagan, for the same reason I'm offended when people compare their Squirt kids to Wayne Gretzky.&nbsp; But tonight, the difference between the two was stark.&nbsp; Consider this from one of Reagan's first press conferences as President:</p>
<blockquote><p>SAM DONALDSON:&nbsp; Mr. President, in describing the continuing recession, tonight, you've blamed mistakes of the past, you've blamed the Congress; does any of the blame lie with you?</p>
<p>REAGAN:&nbsp; Yes, because for many years I was a Democrat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I didn't listen too closely to Obama's press conference, but I watched it all.&nbsp; I don't believe he got a single laugh from the press corps--which LOOVVVES him.&nbsp; Reagan never failed to get a chuckle from his press corps, and most of them hated him.</p>
<p>For that matter, compared to our old nemesis, Bill Clinton, Obama looked puny.</p>
