  content: "John McCain was a war hero and is devoted to the United States.  He may
    not be perfect, and I suspect he would have done a lot of stupid things.  But
    he would not have been trying to destroy the United States and all that it once
    stood for.  I have come to believe that Obama is a terrorist, more effective than
    the 9/11 murderers.  He is on his way to murdering our freedom and our childrens'
    futures, assisted by the Congress and the Courts and the MSM.  \n\nWe've had it,
    unless we have millions, not thousands, showing up on April 15th.  \n\nAlso, no
    matter how \"dumb\" you think McCain was, he tried repeatedly to have Freddie
    Mac and Fannie Mae reformed, which are at the heart of our economic crisis, and
    both of those were controlled, and reform put down by, the Barney Franks and Chris
    Dodd's of the Communist Democrat party.  McCain WAS RIGHT. \n\nHealth care.  Obama
    has tried to adopt McCain's program that Obama lied about (he lies like most of
    us breath) but without the tax credits that would make the plan more affordable.
    \ Obama's version would cost everyone MORE.  McCain WAS RIGHT, and Obama is a
    thief who plagiarized the plan but left out the best part. \n\nBut, you are doing
    just like the One does himself...trying to demonize the opponent, a classic Saul
    Alinsky move, rather than try to show why the jokester Mr. Giggles Obama is not
    as evil as some of us believe he is.  \"Blame Bush\" and talk about McCain.  Great
    deflection of the criticism of the Communist-in-Chief."

<p>I won&rsquo;t write much:&#160; I&rsquo;m too angry. </p>
<p>He has not answered a single question without blaming Bush and the Republicans.&#160; He&rsquo;s blamed the Republicans for the Democrat Congress! </p>
<p>He claims that &ldquo;no one disputes&rdquo; his prediction of the fastest economic growth in the American' history beginning THIS YEAR!&#160; Of course no one disputes it!&#160; Rational people don&rsquo;t argue with insanity.</p>
<p>Finally, he&rsquo;s a Marxist bent on destroying American liberty!&#160; We don&rsquo;t need to know anything else. </p>
<p>You either love liberty or you love Obama.&#160; There&rsquo;s no middle ground.&#160; </p>
<p>Stop him!&#160; Stop him, now!</p>
