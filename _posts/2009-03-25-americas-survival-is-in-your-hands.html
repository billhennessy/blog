<p>Are you as amazed as I am at how quickly our country has descended into something resembling an oversized banana republic?&#160; Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/03/25/the-rule-of-the-mob/">Gangs of thugs</a> freely harass and intimidate AIG employees out of murderous envy</li>
<li>The Obama administration announced its willingness to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aqDuKEqQn39I&amp;refer=home">abandon the US dollar</a> as the international reserve currency</li>
<li>The administration shows no willingness to check <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0WTTkuqvspJpXkAAwjQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMHZkMjZyBHBvcwMxBHNlYwNzcg--/SIG=13lepic2b/EXP=1238110250/**http%3a//www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/25/china.military.report/index.html%3fsection=cnn_latest">China&rsquo;s menacing military</a> build-up, even though the Pentagon issued a warning just today</li>
<li>Secretary of State Clinton went to Mexico to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090325/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/clinton_mexico;_ylt=ApgajBPjIIDMpvU2nuLmlTSs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTJncWx1OXFkBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMDkwMzI1L2NsaW50b25fbWV4aWNvBGNwb3MDNARwb3MDMTIEc2VjA3luX3RvcF9zdG9yeQRzbGsDY2xpbnRvbnVzc2hh">denounce the US</a>, as if you and I caused the border problems and Mexico&rsquo;s lawlessness</li>
<li><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090325/ap_on_re_as/us_nkorea_missile;_ylt=AoJgVWdUEuNiysawJQAPZ5as0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTFoczVxNTV0BHBvcwMxMwRzZWMDYWNjb3JkaW9uX3RvcF9zdG9yaWVzBHNsawN1c25vcnRoa29yZWE-">North Korea</a> shows no fear of the United States as it prepares to test-fire a long-range, nuclear-capable missile</li>
<li>The president of the Czech Republic <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090325/ap_on_bi_ge/eu_eu_us_economy;_ylt=AjvqLj2sPhLNOAJbU807DeOs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTFiYmJjZTRhBHBvcwM0NQRzZWMDYWNjb3JkaW9uX3dvcmxkBHNsawNldXByZXNpZGVuY3k-">publically humiliated and denounced</a> our President&rsquo;s economic plan; and he&rsquo;s a natural ally of the US</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ayGYMQunti1w&amp;refer=home">Treasury bond auction</a> was barely able to dump the US treasuries because no one want American government debt</li>
<li>Congress passed a <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/03/25/to-give-and-to-serve-the-6-billion-national-service-boondoggle/">Marxist youth service</a> bill containing language that allows a bureaucrat to make service compulsory without the consent of the people and <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/03/obamas-youth-brigade-will-not-be.html">prohibits religious expression</a> (12 Republicans supported this bill)</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are just today&rsquo;s headlines.&#160; </p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s good news. The Tea Party movement is swelling.&#160; On Fox News Special Edition, Bret Bair <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,510618,00.html">reported</a> on the MSM&rsquo;s reluctance to cover the tea parties, citing an Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily story:&#160; "The real reason the major media aren't interested in these protests is that they don't agree with them."</p>
<p>If the major media are against us, we&rsquo;re doing something right.</p>
<p>The liberals in both parties who run our government seek to maximize their power and minimize ours.&#160; They hope to make the United States nothing more than sheepish, cowed, socialist land of myrmidons.&#160; No one in Washington will stand up to them.&#160; </p>
<p>But we will.&#160;&#160; We know that man is endowed with rights as natural as breathing.&#160; We don&rsquo;t need college classes on Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, anymore than we need classes on waking up.&#160; Freedom is our natural state. </p>
<p>Some liberals claim that progress requires that we surrender freedom, individualism, and the time of our lives to an all-powerful government.&#160; Sorry, but that&rsquo;s not progress; that&rsquo;s regress.&#160; If man&rsquo;s natural state is freedom, bondage is not a step forward.</p>
<p>Large numbers beget large numbers.&#160;&#160; If 20,000 people were to show up at Kiener Plaza on April 15, no news agency could ignore it.&#160; Traffic would be backed up for miles.&#160; If 100,000 attend the July 4 Tea Party in St. Louis, the whole world will notice.&#160; </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stop recruiting.&#160; We need the participation of every person who yearns freedom and human dignity, regardless of party affiliation or prior understanding of his or her ideology.&#160; Conservatism isn&rsquo;t political&mdash;it&rsquo;s moral.&#160; </p>
<p>In his introduction to &ldquo;God and Man at Yale,&rdquo; William F. Buckley wrote that the battle between individualism and collectivism is the same battle as God vs Satan, fought on a different plane.&#160; Your participation in the Tea Party movement is a moral choice.&#160; You and your family should be proud of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven&rsquo;t joined, please consider this question:&#160; when the gangs of thugs come after your home, when the government taxes 90 percent of your income, when inflation hits 120 percent a year, will you still believe that soccer games and &ldquo;American Idol&rdquo; were more important than restoring our republic?&#160; </p>
