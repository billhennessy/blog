  content: Interesting analogy - good points!  I'm not quite sure how well your title
    fits with your piece, but it's a good article!

<p>The parish or congregation that&rsquo;s most generous at the collection basket is not necessarily the church that sends the most souls to heaven. Nor is the best attended church the one that saves the most.&#160; Yet the purpose of every Christian congregation is to put souls through the Pearly Gates, not to put butts in pews. </p>
<p> Michael Steele&rsquo;s GOP made much, last week, of the fact that his party raised more money in February than did the Democrats.&#160; Yet, how much money the GOP raises and spends is of value to the republic only if the GOP&rsquo;s purpose is to preserve (or restore) that republic.&#160; In its current composition, the Republican party seems as willing to shred the Constitution and the rule of law as its supposed nemesis. </p>
<p>The Constitution was the animating document for our government.&#160; It authorizes others to do particular things on our behalf, and it explicitly prohibits those people from doing anything else.&#160; It is a specific, or limited, power of attorney attested by each of us to the federal government.&#160; When the government exceeds those explicitly authorized activities, it breeches the law and our trust.&#160; </p>
<p>The Democrat party, being an organ of what Mark Levin calls &ldquo;statism&rdquo; and what I call communism, hates the Constitution.&#160; The GOP under Michael Steele claims to love the Constitution, believes it loves the Constitution.&#160; But the GOP loves the Constitution the way congregants loves the church that&#160; makes them feel best about their sinfulness.</p>
<p>Political salvation is as simple to define and as difficult to achieve as theological salvation.&#160; In one, we must simply live, believe, love, and pray according to the example of Christ; in the other, we must reject the arbitrary rule of other men.&#160; Anything less results in slavery&mdash;slavery to the devil or slavery to the state.&#160; </p>
<p>One more thing:&#160; if God intended us to be free, as our Declaration states and as we all claim, then do we have the moral option of enslaving ourselves to the state?&#160; Is there a dime&rsquo;s difference between surrendering our political souls to Washington and selling our immortal souls to Satan?&#160; </p>
<p>Consider your answers carefully.&#160; If you get this one wrong, there could be hell to pay&mdash;and all the gold in the GOP&rsquo;s coffers won&rsquo;t pay that ransom.</p>
