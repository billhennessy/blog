<p><strong>Obama to Give Gitmo Terrorists Welfare and Home in the USA</strong></p>
<p>From The <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/03/welfare_for_freed_gitmo_detain.asp">Weekly Standard</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the detainees, deemed non-threatening, may be released into the United States as free men, Blair confirmed.</p>
<p>That would happen when they can't be returned to their home countries, because the governments either won't take them or the U.S. fears they will be abused or tortured. </p>
<p><strong>Blair said the former prisoners would have [to] get some sort of assistance to start their new lives in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;We can't put them out on the street,&rdquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, but we can tell our wounded warriors to pay for their own medical treatment.&#160; Gateway Pundit has more on this <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/03/unreal-welfare-for-gitmo-detainees.html">OUTRAGE</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Obama Giving Himself Access to Your Hard Drive</strong></p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t see this reported in the communist press in the USA.&#160; Obama is planning to spy on your computer activity:</p>

<p>If you want to know what life will be like in 4 years, read "The Gulag Archipelago" by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. </p>
<p><strong>Missouri Governor Nixon Accused of Gestapo Tactics and Intimidation</strong></p>
<p>Remember the Missouri report that warned law enforcement officers to treat <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2009/03/22/according-to-missouri-governor-jay-nixon-im-probably-a-terrorist-and-so-are-you/">conservatives as terrorists</a>?&#160; Well, <a href="http://mopns.com/2009/03/26/nixon-henchman-intimidate-citizen-who-filed-sunshine-request/">the blogger who broke that story</a> claims that Governor Jay Nixon has sent the Missouri Highway Patrol after him and his friends in a show of brute force intimidation.</p>
<p>If this is true, Nixon must be removed from office immediately and prosecuted.&#160; If it&rsquo;s untrue, then the blogger owes a big round of apologies. </p>
