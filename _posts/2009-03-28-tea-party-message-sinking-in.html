<p>Rasmussen's weekly report shows the Tea Party message of limited government and lower taxes is hitting home with voters.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/more_voters_than_ever_say_tax_cuts_help_the_economy">Tax Cuts</a>: &nbsp;More voters than ever now say tax cuts help the economy. &nbsp;Over 60 percent now agree with JFK, Reagan, Bush, and the undeniable facts of economic history: cutting taxes increases GDP and personal wealth. &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A separate survey released&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/66_say_obama_likely_to_raise_taxes_on_those_earning_less_than_250_000_a_year" target="_self">earlier today</a>&nbsp;found that 66% of voters think the president is likely to raise taxes on those who make less than $250,000 per year.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll" target="_blank">Obama Approval</a>: &nbsp;Obama's net favorability is down to +4 from + 30 after his inauguration. &nbsp;Rasmussen notes that Obama's flurry of exposure--The Tonight Show, 60 Minutes, primetime press conference, townhall--did not increase his favorability at all. &nbsp;In fact, it's fallen 2 points since last week. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/just_11_say_government_can_run_financial_institutions_better" target="_blank">Nationalized Banks</a>: &nbsp;Only 11 percent believe the government can do a better job running banks.</p>
<p>If these trends continue, Obama will be unable to influence key Democrats in Congress, and he will be a 3-year lame duck. &nbsp;That's the best the country can hope for.</p>
<p>You can help by spreading the word: &nbsp;Obama's plans for a socialist dictatorship are dangerous and un-American. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop him! &nbsp;Stop him, now!</p>
