  content: I must sadly agree with you on this one.  It has dangerous earmarks of
    totalitarianism.

<p>Barack Obama has asserted his dictatorial powers by <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20625.html">firing GM CEO Rick Waggoner</a>.&#160; The firing of a company&rsquo;s chief executive by a US president should send chills down the spine of every American.&#160; This is totalitarianism defined.</p>
<p>While Hennessy&rsquo;s View has been critical of Waggoner&rsquo;s leadership at GM, we oppose illegal and unconstitutional dictatorial powers in the hands of any US president.&#160; </p>
<p>Nothing in the Constitution permits a sitting <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/03/29/gm-ceo-resigns-at-obamas-behest/">president to direct a private company</a>.&#160; For that matter, the Constitution prohibits the US from owning stock in private companies.</p>
<p>The precedence is remarkable.&#160; Under its newly acquired, unconstitutional powers, the government could buy a minority position in any US company and replace its management team with hand-picked cronies.&#160; </p>
<p>American&rsquo;s should sign up for a <a href="http://taxdayteaparty.com/">Tax Day Tea Party</a> in their area immediately.&#160; They should also flood local media with their view that the Constitution, not a two-bit dictator, should control government activity.</p>
