  content: "Bill,  \n\nYou did a great job on Glenn Beck!\n\nLook, you folks need
    to put TEETH in your Tea Party, unless you want just another &lsquo;venting rally&rsquo;,
    after which you go home to more unraveling of our constitutional Republic.\n\nHave
    one of your rally speakers publicly read the &ldquo;Demand Letter to our Congressman
    and Senators&rdquo; (see the AmericaAgain! project website) and offer the local
    citizens the opportunity to sign up to organize a local  Citizens&rsquo; Homeland
    Security Association (CHSA).  \n\nA CHSA is like a Homeowners&rsquo; Association
    on steroids; the Covenants &amp; Restrictions you&rsquo;ll be enforcing against
    your two US senators and your US congressman are those in the U.S. Constitution,
    that have been violated for generations.  We the People never had a tactical enforcement
    mechanism.\n\nNow we do.  \n\nThe AmericaAgain! project is lawful, peaceful, and
    practical.  It requires We the People begin performing the duties of self-government.
    \ We tactically enforce the U.S. Constitution against our own members of Congress
    (at home in our own State Court, under State civil &amp; criminal statutes.  We
    begin to preserve, protect, and defend the U.S. Constitution against criminals
    for the first time in history.\n\nMike (host of the daily Mike Church Show on
    Sirius/XM) will introduce the AmericaAgain! project at the D.C. Tax Day Tea Party.
    \ Hopefully the St. Louis rally will have a speaker read the Demand Letter also.
    \n\nThis year, let&rsquo;s tell them: New Deck, New Deal.\n\nLet&rsquo;s Roll.

<p>Obama and his minions want to tell you how much you can make, how much water your toilet can flush, where you can work, what career you may pursue, where your kids can go to school, what your college-age kids can major in, the kind of toilet paper you can use, how many sheets of copy paper you may use in a month, and what you can name your children. &nbsp;Don't bother arguing with me--all of these controls are in place in European "democracies" or Canada. &nbsp;And the left want them here, in your country. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd rather be dead.</p>
