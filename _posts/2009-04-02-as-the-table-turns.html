<p>MoveOn.org is the perfect advocate for big government; neither takes &nbsp;responsibility for the results of its positions. &nbsp;In fact, they don't even review the results. &nbsp;They merely congratulate themselves on victory and seek a new horror to reign down upon the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to MoveOn's attack on President Bush, we're lucky that RedState is watching.<br />
