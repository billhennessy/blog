<p>The <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/">USGS&nbsp;</a>reports a strong, 6.3 earthquake in Central Italy [<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=42.4228,13.3945(M6.3+-+Central+Italy+-+2009+April+6+01:32:42+UTC)&amp;t=h&amp;z=7">map of quake]</a>. &nbsp;No news on major news sites yet.</p>
<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;<a href="http://foxnews.com">Fox News </a>now has banner but no story.</p>
<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,512623,00.html">moves fast</a>. From Sky News Service quoting&nbsp;Rafael Abreu Hael of U.S. Geological Survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This is a significant earthquake," he said. "This is a shallow quake but there is definitely a possibility of damage and even injuries. It is going to depend on what type of buildings are in the area."</p></blockquote>
<p>Location not far from Rome which felt the quake.</p>
<p>More from <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE53506120090406">Reuters</a>, but still few details on damage or injuries. &nbsp;Hopefully none.</p>
<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;4/6, 7:56 AM: &nbsp;Reuters reports that an Italian scientist who predicted the earthquake in January was muzzled by the government. &nbsp;The Italian government ordered seismologist&nbsp;Gioacchino Giuliani to remove all references to his prediction from the internet after the mayor of L'Aquila complained that Giulani's prediction was creating a panic.</p>
<p>This is not the first time governments have ostricized scientists who accurately predicted earthquakes. &nbsp;The US Geological Survey fired <a href="http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Sci/sci.geo.earthquakes/2006-01/msg00363.html">Jim Berkland</a> in the 197os, then launched a PR campaign to ridicule the man whose prediction accuracy far exceeds that of the USGS. &nbsp;Berkland's predictions, it seems, fall outside of the scientific consensus.</p>
