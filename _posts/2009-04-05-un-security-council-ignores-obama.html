<p>Jimmy Carter was the Rodney Dangerfield of international politics: &nbsp;he got no respect from the people who counted. &nbsp;The bad guys laughed at him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad guys must be rolling on the floor tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Leaders Respect Nothing But Strength</strong></p>
<p>Almost simultaneous with North Korea's&nbsp;<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/04/05/and-now-for-the-ineffectual-protestations-from-the-world/">launching an ICBM</a> in violation of international law and in defiance of US warnings, Barack Obama stood before the world and declared &nbsp;his intention to disarm the arsenal for democracy. Using irony fit for Oscar Wilde, Obama asserted: &nbsp;"I am not naive."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. President, yes you are.</p>
<p>In truth, Obama's vision of nuclear disarmament is like a fat guy's vision of wearing a size 43 regular suit: &nbsp;nice words, mere preference. &nbsp;A "goal" that "might not be achieved in my lifetime," is meaningless when coming from a man in his 40s and in good health. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In international politics, though, the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/05/obama-pledges-lead-world-nuclear-free-future/">speech screamed weakness</a>. &nbsp;By talking about disarmament as North Korea thumbed its nuclear-tipped nose in our faces, Obama gave the unmistakable appearance of capitulation to a nuclear North Korea. &nbsp;By default, this permissiveness extends to Iran. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our weakness was compounded by the US bungled handling of the missile threat. &nbsp;The US leaked veiled threats of knocking down the missile in the weeks leading up to the launch. &nbsp;When the missile was deployed, though, Secretary of Defense Gates indicated that the US had no intention of interfering with the missile's flight. &nbsp;Retreat is the ultimate form of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>No Port in a Storm</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">After North Korea's defiance and Obama's disarmament speech, the US President expected his buddies in the UN Security Council to save him with strong sanctions. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/05/obama-urges-action-decision-meeting-n-korea-launch/">That didn't happen</a>. &nbsp;Instead, the UN Security Council simply walked away. &nbsp;Fox News reports:</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="textbodyblack">Council members met for three hours, seeking above all a unified response, but broke up for the night without issuing even a customary preliminary statement of condemnation. Diplomats privy to the closed-door talks say China, Russia, Libya and Vietnam were concerned about further alienating and destabilizing North Korea.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><strong>Jimmy Carter II</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Those who remember the Carter Administration might feel some deja vu. &nbsp;Carter repeatedly displayed weakness prior to a confrontation, demanded international condemnation after the event, then accepted the UN's "leave us alone" response. &nbsp;Eventually, Iran got brazen, took 80+ American hostages for 444 days and helped give us the greatest president of the 20th century.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Expect "international crisis" to quickly sweep "econonic crisis" off the front pages. &nbsp;And let's hope the economy recovers. &nbsp;Obama is unqualified to handle a single challenge much less dual true crises. &nbsp;</div>
