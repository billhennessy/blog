    you must be kidding.  the anti-americans are the conservatives who hope, against hope, that their jesus-laden b.s. will rule the world.

    the only thing worse than prophecy is self fulfilling prophecy.  the only thing that has a chance of saving us is keeping the armageddonistas away from the levers of power.

  content: "If you are quoting Dick Morris, you lose all credibility. Morris is a
    paid shill.\n\nOur new president is hardly \"anti-American.\" Quite the opposite.
    He has realized -- correctly -- that American interests are not served in policies
    that isolate us from the rest of the world. \n\nYour utter hyperbole makes your
    beliefs silly and nonsensical. Obama has done NOTHING to \"bring about the destruction
    of the United States.\" He has instituted a large middle class tax cut, and he
    is facing squarely the horrendous mess that Bush left behind. \n\nI have one very
    large question for you tea baggers: What EXACTLY would you do to reduce our future
    debt? Obama has openly recognized that the escalating costs of Medicare and Social
    Security are an immense problem to be reckoned with. That is why his budget proposal
    is so large. What do you people -- with all your so-called \"righteous anger\"
    -- propose that we do about these two issues??? Are you all going to opt out of
    those programs??? What about the unfunded Medicare drug program that Bush instituted
    that ramped up the cost over-runs even more??? What do we do about that??? You
    people LOVE to talk about earmarks, but earmarks are less than 1% of the federal
    budget. Welfare and food stamps are also miniscule. The REALLY big problems are
    Medicare and Social Security. So if you are all SO smart -- tell us, please --
    WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE THAT WE DO???"

  content: "Really?  Dick Morris?  That's the best you can come up with?\n\nYour writings
    are actually more extreme than the Constitution Party platform!  The St Louis
    Tea Partiers would have been better served with a less extreme organizer.  \n\nYou
    compare the President to \"degenerate traitors like Benedict Arnold, the Rosenbergs,
    and Alger Hiss\", you call the President a \"shadow of a man... stupid, arrogant,
    childish, spoiled, naive, and dangerous\".  You refer to the majority of hard-working
    patriotic Americans with whom you have political differences as \"selfish and
    dimwitted\".   \n\nNow for rubbing your nose in your blatant misinformation:\n\nYou
    typed \"The FSB shall have the authority of &ldquo;regulation and oversight to
    all systemically important financial institutions, instruments, and markets...\"\n
    \nbut the cited document says:\n\n\"...the FSB should collaborate with the IMF
    to provide early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks and the actions
    needed to address them; to reshape our regulatory systems so that our authorities
    are able to identify and take account of macro-prudential risks; to extend regulation
    and oversight to all systemically important financial institutions, instruments
    and markets. This will include, for the first time, systemically important hedge
    funds...\"\n\nSee how you changed the meaning of the document by substituting
    \"have the authority\" for \"should collaborate with\"?\n\nFinally, how do you
    hope to restore the republic?"

    Excellent article.  Your writing continue to ring true...especially after April 15th.  It seems that Obama...lacking any experience....is stuck in the university and ghetto community influences....having no idea what it is like more 90% of real Americans (of course we cannot even seen is actual birth certificate).

    I was sadden by his staff's recent DHS report...but understand that the veterans are capable of uprising against his socialist policies....as soon as he figures out how to get the guns our of their hands.

    Keep up the good work!!!!

<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s shameful and anti-American behavior this past weekend in Europe deserves the kind of scorn reserved for degenerate traitors like Benedict Arnold, the Rosenbergs, and Alger Hiss.&#160; </p>
<p>On Thursday in London, the President of the United States transferred America&rsquo;s economic sovereignty from we, the people, to a small group of European central bankers.&#160; </p>
<p>In the words of former Clinton staffer <a href="http://www.dickmorris.com/blog/2009/04/06/the-declaration-of-independence-has-been-repealed/#more-568">Dick Morris</a>, <strong>Obama &ldquo;nullified the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</strong>&#160; Specifically, Obama signed an agreement to create the Financial Stability Board comprised of European central banks and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.&#160; The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g19Ud_lbAggIp4FGT5xE2es_juMAD97AFRVG1">FSB</a> shall have the authority of &ldquo;regulation and oversight to all systemically important financial institutions, instruments, and markets&hellip;[including] systemically important hedge funds.&rdquo;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>Having singlehanded, and in violation of the Constitutional requirement of obtaining the Senate&rsquo;s advice and consent for treaties, Obama went on to the continent to humiliate and denigrate his country.</p>
<p>Describing the United States&mdash;the country of which he is head of state and of government&mdash;to European students, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5100338/Barack-Obama-arrogant-US-has-been-dismissive-to-allies.html">Obama said</a> &ldquo;<strong>America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive&rdquo; to its allies</strong>.&#160; </p>
<p>Next, Obama promised to begin<strong> unilateral nuclear disarmament</strong>, leaving the whole world naked in the face of aggression from malevolent super-powers and rogue states like North Korea, Iran, and, potentially, Pakistan.&#160; Obama&rsquo;s disarmament promise came hours after North Korea test-fired an ICBM capable of reaching Hawaii or Alaska.</p>
<p>Finally, faced with brazen hostility from North Korea, Obama turned, not to his own power as President of the most powerful economic and military country the planet has ever known, but to effeminate and corrupt United Nations.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>I have few human feelings for this shadow of a man.&#160; He is stupid, arrogant, childish, spoiled, naive, and dangerous.&#160; He has sold the greatest nation on earth to envious European bureaucrats in order to obtain for himself the fleeting praise of shallow people.&#160; He has, with the help of millions of selfish and dimwitted American voters, undone 230 years of American progress and centuries of Western philosophical thought.&#160; His work would not be more effective had he gone back in time and convinced the mothers of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Rousseau, Adam Smith, and Thomas Jefferson to obtain late-term abortions.&#160; </p>
<p>There is one distinction between Barack Obama and the traitors I named at the top of this post.&#160; The others failed to bring about the destruction of the United States.&#160; Obama succeeded. </p>
<p>Now it falls on us&mdash;the Americans&mdash;to restore the republic Obama destroyed.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>NOTE:&#160; When <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2008/11/04/were-all-communists-now/">I wrote this on election night</a>, I was only half serious.&#160; Many of these &ldquo;predictions&rdquo; were mere sarcasm.&#160; In other words, Obama&rsquo;s march toward totalitarianism is worse than my exaggerations!&#160; </p>
