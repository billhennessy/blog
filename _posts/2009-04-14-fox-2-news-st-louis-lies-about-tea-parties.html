  content: "Typical lazy journalism, Jako should be ashamed of himself. \n\nHere is
    a link to the constitution party http://www.constitutionparty.com/ interestingly
    enough Ron Paul endorsed Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party for President
    during the 2008 elections, IMO that in itself speaks volumes for the Constitution
    Party. Far from a white supremacist group.\n\nHere is their description from their
    web site:\n\n\"The Democrats and Republicans have squandered the Founders' legacy
    of liberty and justice under the Constitution. Countless government officials
    in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government ignore their
    oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\n\nJoin the Constitution Party in
    its work to restore our government to its Constitutional limits and our law to
    its Biblical foundations.\"\n\nMy what a bunch of radicals they seem to be...Sounds
    like a group anybody who's serious about reforming government could get behind
    and support.\n\nJako is a sorry excuse for a reporter. I found this information
    in 1 minute on Google, I think he did too but of course the truth probably wouldn't
    be as exciting as all the BS he just fabricated.\n\nPS Bill thanks for all the
    effort you have put forward in organizing the Tea Party, I will be there this
    evening."

  content: An outragoeus slander. Frankly The Constitution Party is a little wacky
    (though not racist per se) but linking you with a marginal third party who they
    claim is racist is literally defamation. You should sue.

    interviewed, to get his take on how Jaco got the idea the CP was involved in the
    Tea Parties?

    extrmeist.  You think they would be more hysterical about the Socialist Nazi Party
    growing in MO; they have an Adopt a Highway sign somewhere near Springfield (I
    think) or at least the Islamic Centers and groups like CAIR  which are breeding
    grounds and/or money laundering for terrorist.\n\n\nThink we should be more than
    upset about the following:\n\n\n\nFBI spied on TEA Party Americans\n \nExclusive
    to the Northeast Intelligence Network &amp; Canada Free Press\n\nDouglas J. Hagmann,
    Director &amp; Judi McLeod, Founding Editor, Canada Free Press\n\nhttp://homelandsecurityus.com/?p=2659#more-2659\n\n\nSybil"

  content: Just one more slanted story from the channel's resident lefty.   Jaco does
    it on a regular basis.  No one with any brains takes his little "pieces" seriously.

    checks, \nwhat will these people do when they can't pay their monthly bills and
    buy food \nor their medicines? They already live in poverty. But we can send millions
    of \ndollars to other countries that never help use. Why can't we take care of
    our \nown first? Once the elderly that are on a fixed income get behind how are
    they \ngoning to get caught up? I' m furious with the goverment."

<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/04/breaking-st-louis-news-accuses-tea.html">Charles Jaco of Fox 2 News </a>in St. Louis filed a fabricated story claiming that a) the St. Louis Tea Party is organized by something called The Constitution Party, and b) the Constitution Party is an extremist, white supremacist group.</p>
<p>I will say only this:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Neither Dana Loesch nor I is a member of the Constitution Party. &nbsp;I did not know of such an organization before April 14, 2009</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The Constitution Party did not sponsor, organize, or advise the organizers of the St. Louis Tax Day Party or the February 27th Tea Party</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I have no evidence that The Constitution Party is a white supremacist group</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Charles Jaco has no evidence contradicting any of the above assertions</p>
<p>In short, Jaco lied. &nbsp;Every person attending today's Tea Party in Kiener Plaza at 6:30 p.m. deserves an on-air apology by the general manager, Spencer Koch. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;I just spoke a manager at KTVI. &nbsp;PLEASE DO NOT SEND THEM TEA BAGS. &nbsp;I didn't realize that they handle suspicious packages as carefully (FBI) as the government. &nbsp;My stupidity at play here, folks. &nbsp;I'm sorry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already followed my bad advice, &nbsp;please email. &nbsp;I'll contact the station and let them know. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, my apologies to you and to Channel 2</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">If you would like to see such an apology, contact Channel 2. &nbsp;I</span><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">n fact, why not send them some tea bags?</span></p>
