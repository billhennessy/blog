  content: Charles Jaco is a buffoon  and everyone knows it. He could not seethe truth
    if it hit him between the eyes

  content: Charles Jaco is a left-wing journalist. I didn't like him when he was on
    97.1 Talk with Jamie Allman and I turn him off when I see him on Fox 2. I also
    wanted to let you know that the word "Calendar" is misspelled in the header in
    the right sidebar of your site. It currently reads "Caldendar". Thx!

    His Wikipedia listing doesn't even mention the staged correspondence from the gulf.  So much for a social encyclopedia.
    If only these career-ending mistakes would end careers...

<p>Just watch.  And laugh.  Then call KTVI's General Manager, Spencer Koch at&nbsp;314-213-2222,&nbsp;and demand an apology for Sgt. Bilko's latest travesty reported on <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/04/breaking-st-louis-news-accuses-tea.html">Gateway Pundit</a>.</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z0VxWZszyg&w=425&h=344]</p>
<p>Too good to be true?  Ask Charles:  <a href="http://mailto:cjaco@charlesjaco.com">cjaco@charlesjaco.com</a>.</p>
<p>On April 13, Charles Jaco reported on KTVI News that an organization called The Constitution Party sponsored and helped organize the St. Louis Tea Party. &nbsp;Jaco also claimed that The Constitution Party is a white supremacist group. &nbsp;Despite no evidence of either claim, and the indisputible fact that The Constitution Party had no hand in the St. Louis Tea Party, Jaco persists with his lie and KTVI management refuses to apologize.</p>
