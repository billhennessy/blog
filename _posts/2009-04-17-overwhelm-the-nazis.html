<p>The American Nazis are holding a rally on the Arch grounds at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, April 18. &nbsp;<a href="http://regions.adl.org/missouri/events/rally-for-respect.html">The Anti-Defamation League </a>is sponsoring a counter-rally in Forest Park at the same time.</p>
<p>I will be at Forest Park.</p>
<p>So I have some strong disagreements with some of the sponsoring organizations of the counter-rally. &nbsp;Big deal. &nbsp;If the point of the counter-rally is to oppose Nazism, then I can easily look past those differences for a couple of hours. &nbsp;We'll pick up the other fights later.</p>
