<p>This is my last post on Hennessy's View, at least for some time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My work for the St. Louis Tea Party movement is very important to me and, in my opinion, to you. &nbsp;Our government is moving quickly to obliterate all vestiges of the free market republic that America once was. &nbsp;With the Republican party in disarray and the Democrat party in the hands of statist despots, the tea partiers are the only thing standing between liberty and tyranny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I choose liberty.</p>
<p>To better focus my attention on restoring the republic, reducing the scope of government, and rewriting Congress in the 2010 elections, I am mothballing Hennessy's View. &nbsp; I will continue blogging on <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com">St. Louis Tea Party's</a> web site. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Joining me on that site will be several other servant-leaders of the tea party movement in St. Louis. &nbsp;While I will miss writing about global warming nuts, pro-life movement, and party politics, I feel that God has put me in a position to make a real difference for our children and grandchildren. &nbsp;It would be a sin for me to ignore the opportunity and the duty He presents.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
