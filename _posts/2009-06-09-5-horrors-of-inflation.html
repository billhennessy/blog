<p>Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp wanted to index everything, especially Treasury notes and taxes.&#160; By "indexing," we mean tying rates (interest and tax) to the inflation rate.&#160; Calls for indexing subsided after Reagan and Volcker did what Ford and Carter could not:&#160; whip inflation now.</p>
<p>With a $2 trillion deficit this year and multi-trillion deficits projected a<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L6pDyjqqsvY/SirX9XTV4bI/AAAAAAAAb8A/-4syj1_sXwg/s1600-h/obama+deficit.jpg" target="_blank">s far as the eye can see</a>, inflation will return to ravage the American consumer.&#160; To make a former Economics professor happy, inflation deteriorates the purchasing power of a dollar.&#160; (Happy, Bruce?)&#160; But it does more than that.&#160; Here are 5 horrors of inflation that will come to pass thanks to your U. S. Government:</p>
<p><strong>Tax</strong><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/03/warning_bracket_creep_ahead.html"><strong> Bracket Creep</strong></a>:&#160; When your household income exceeds $110,000 (married filing jointly) a year, you lose a lot of deductions.&#160; For instance, the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p972.pdf">child tax credit</a>.&#160; As wages inflate to keep up with costs, millions of tax payers will cross this threshold and lose deductions.&#160; In fact, it's common for a family's take home pay to fall as a result of pay increase.&#160; You take home $60,000 a year after taxes and deductions, you get a $10,000 raise, and you're now taking home $53,000.&#160; Fun, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Interest Rates</strong>:&#160; Interest rates represent the price of cash and are most sensitive to inflation.&#160; If I lend you $1,000 for 10 years, the interest I charge must, at least, cover inflation.&#160; If inflation is 2 percent over the period, then I would charge 2 percent interest and you would pay me $1,218.99 in year 10.&#160; I break even.&#160; If inflation is 18 percent (and that's not unlikely), to break even I charge 18 percent interest and in 10 years you pay me $5,233.84.&#160; Big difference, huh? That's compounded annually.&#160; Compounded monthly, far more common, and you have to pay me over $5,900.</p>
<p><strong>Investments Lose Value</strong>:&#160; Having seen the effect of 18 percent inflation on a $1000, 10-year loan compounded annually, you can see how careful you'll be before investing.&#160; Would you buy a 10-year T-bill at Friday's closing rate of 3.84 percent if you knew inflation over the next 10 years would be 10 percent?&#160; Of course you wouldn't! You'd lose money.&#160; (To perform an easy future value calculation in Excel, type =fv([rate],[# periods],0,[present value]), for example:&#160; =fv(.0384,10,0,1000).&#160; A more accurate method for solving bond pricing with Excel is <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/EXCELHW.htm" target="_blank">explained here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Quality Plummets</strong>:&#160; If you were born before about 1968, you probably remember that the 1970s saw lots of really crappy, low quality junk on store shelves everywhere.&#160; It wasn't just a change in tase, it was a response to inflation.&#160; When prices of goods and services rise faster than consumers' incomes, manufacturers and retailers must find cheaper goods and services to fill a given need.&#160; Jack-in-the-Box was caught mixing oatmeal in its hamburgers.&#160; Plastic furniture replaced wood, steel, and leather.&#160; Polyester replaced wool and cotton.&#160; Men let their hair grow hideously long to save money at the barber.&#160; While you can argue all you want that buying low quality costs more in the long run, if you need toilet paper today, Charmin's higher quality at $5.00 a roll does you no good if have $3.00 to spend.</p>
<p><strong>Savings Dwindle</strong>:&#160; If you know the dollar in your pocket today will be worth $0.65 tomorrow, you'll spend it today.&#160; During periods of high inflation, the marginal propensity to consume skyrockets.&#160; True, it skyrocketed during the relatively low inflation periods of the 1990s and 2000s, but just wait to see what happens when generations of spenders meet years of high inflation.&#160; And every new round of fast spending drives prices higher, as more money chases after fewer, crappier goods and services.&#160; Why not buy that $5.00 hamburger today since it will cost $5.50 tomorrow and $7.00 next week?</p>
<p>These are just 5 horrors of inflation.&#160; Please use the comments section to provide your inflation horror stories.&#160; If you have any tips to help people prepare for and deal with high inflation, please add those, too.</p>
<p>Why would the government touch off inflation?&#160; Perhaps because, in the short term, inflation tends to help the poorest quintile, according to<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=g8tsKtx1jXMC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=inflation+hurts+quality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jO83buHKu0&amp;sig=KPPj5hvpQxqFtAl8yqTgP5f3UJs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QtorStDMN5aYMq7-jcUJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#PPA162,M1"> Heinz Herrmann</a>.&#160; While the inflation devastates the poor in the long run, a period of very high inflation over the next 2 years will allow the party in power to say, "Look, your wages have increased 10 percent since we took office."&#160; Of course, their taxes will have gone up 12 percent, prices 15 percent, and their standard of living will have fallen.&#160; But who wants to wallow in those sordid details?&#160; This administration is all about hype.</p>
<p>MORE:&#160; Gateway Pundit reports that<a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/06/us-loses-most-jobs-at-fastest-rate-in.html"> Obama is killing jobs </a>faster than any U. S. President in history.</p>
<p>*UPDATE*&#160; Fed is shocked--Shocked!--that multi-trillion dollar deficits are <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090606/D98L67500.html" target="_blank">driving up interest rates</a> instead of stimulating home buying.&#160; I suppose they don't teach Finance 501 in Harvard's MBA program.&#160; With interest rates rising, home buying will slacken, economy will sink.&#160; Hello, Jimmy Carter.&#160; <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Drude reports</a> that NYT will carry Monday morning story of tension gripping Obama's economic team.&#160; About friggin' time.</p>
<p>While we're at it, one of the best -- if not THE best -- article on what's wrong with the Obama economic plan is on NY Times today.&#160; Read it.&#160; It's very long, but you must read it.&#160; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/opinion/07cohanWEB.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1" target="_blank">Cohen and Lewis</a> skewer the White House like no one I've read to date.&#160; Intelligent, informative, penetrating, and convincing.&#160; This is the op-ed that could topple Obama's house of cards.</p>
