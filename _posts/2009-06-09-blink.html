<p><img style="margin:4px;" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-339" title="af1_photo1" alt="af1_photo1" src="http://stlouisteaparty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/af1_photo1-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />In "Blink*" Malcolm Gladwell explains the human mind's remarkable ability to arrive at truth instaneously.&#160; The book's&#160; first story involves a Greek statue scientifically proven to be authentic . . . except that every human expert who sees it instinctively knows something's wrong.&#160; Turns out, of course, that the humans are right and science is wrong.&#160; The statue was a fraud.</p>
<p>When I first heard the story of the AF1 fly-over of New York City that created panic on Wall Street, I immediately, instinctively knew that it the publicity photo story was wrong.&#160; Fraud.&#160; Lie.&#160; I wasn't alone. In fact, you couldn't squeeze all the skeptics onto Manhatten Island.</p>
<p>Since then, the White House has, through its inept cover-up, provided much evidence that we, the skeptics, were right.&#160; Ann Althouse has some <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2009/05/air-force-1-flight-over-nyc-cant.html">compellingly inconclusive observations </a>about the photo released on Friday, along with news that someone of insignificant position was fired over the matter.</p>
<blockquote><p>But this is just staring me in the face, and I feel required to say what I see. The pieces don't fit. I want to know more. The Caldera resignation does not turn the page. <span>Who was in Air Force 1?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Her closing paragraph, quoted in part above, sounds remarkably like the questions and comments of Greek statuary experts Gladwell quoted.&#160; The quotes came during a period when the statues were still scientifically considered authentic.&#160; The experts did not doubt the science.&#160; They simply knew the science was wrong.&#160; (Read "Blink*" to understand what I mean by that seemingly contradictory statement.)</span></p>
<p><span>I am not a conspiracy guy.&#160; In fact, I think conspiracy theorists suffer from some mental disorder that will someday have a name.&#160; But Ann Althouse is absolutely right on this, and everyone who spends 2 minutes thinking about the story knows she's right. </span></p>
<p><span>Something is missing here.&#160; It might something small and stupid that the White House should have released immediately.&#160; It might be, instead, something frightening and sinister for which the White House should gain a new occupant.&#160; Early in an administration, both incompetence and treachery are possible.&#160; The case of the AF1 fly-over involves something Obama doesn't want us to know.&#160; And by "us," I mean the American people--however they voted in November. </span></p>
