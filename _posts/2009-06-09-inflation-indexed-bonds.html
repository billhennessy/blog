<p>One single legislative act will stop government overspending in its tracks.</p>
<p>In 1978, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NWQyNWEyODdjNmQ0ZmFlNDE5MzY3ZGM4N2E4OGRmZjc=" target="_blank">Representative Jack Kemp</a> (R-NY) proposed legislation (which had no chance of passage in Tip O'Neill's Democrat Congress) designed to stop the government from defrauding investors with inflation: bond indexing.&#160; The measure would have the additional value of discouraging government spending.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman endorsed Kemp's proposal.&#160; Let's dust off this bill and push it through Congress as a memorial to Jack Kemp.</p>
<p><strong>What Is It?</strong></p>
<p>Bond indexing requires that all government issued bonds must be retired at their current value.&#160; In other words, the maturity payment of Treasury bond is face value plus inflation over the period of the bond's life.&#160; This keeps interest rates down, since the bond is guaranteed to match inflation, and prevents taxpayers from paying taxes on a loss, should inflation exceed the cumulative interest the bond paid.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Need It?</strong></p>
<p>Borrowing is great for governments.&#160; As the US government continues to break every borrowing record in the books, it realizes -- just as it did in the late 70s -- that the easiest way to retire these debts is inflation.&#160;&#160; A trillion dollars owed 10 years from now isn't that much money if the annual inflation rate is, say, 25 percent during those 10 years.</p>
<p>If inflation threatens to wipe out the interest earned on the bond, lender will require much higher interest rates.&#160; That Treasury buyers now settle for yields of about 3 percent on 10-year notes tells us the borrows do not expect much inflation--or they they plan to dump the bonds before inflation picks up.</p>
<p>Once inflation enters the scene, everything changes.&#160; If I expect today's dollar to buy $.50 worth of goods and services three years from now, I'll want each dollar of that bond to be worth at least $2.00.&#160; I get that return through higher interest rates--inflation plus something for the use of my money.</p>
<p>But the government taxes the lender on the return, so higher interest rates to cover inflation must go higher still to cover additional taxes.&#160; So if I want to realize a gain of 3 percent over 10 years after taxes and inflation, I'll need a very high interest rate should inflation kick up.</p>
<p>That yield-inflation-tax spiral destroyed the American ecnonomy in the 1970s, and threatens to repeat itself in the next 10 years.&#160;&#160; The government is simply borrowing too much, too fast, to sustain long-term, predictable growth.</p>
<p><strong>What Can I Do?</strong></p>
<p>Ask your Congressmen and Senators to introduce legislation requiring that all Treasury bonds be indexed to inflation. And treasure having shared the Earth with such as <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjMyZDNjY2M1ODRlYTQyOTZhM2ZiMjQ0ZTgxZjQ1ODc=" target="_blank">Jack Kemp</a>.</p>
