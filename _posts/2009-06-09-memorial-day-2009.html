<p>It's not a sale.</p>
<p>It's not a party.</p>
<p>It's not a day off work.</p>
<p>It's a memorial to those who placed freedom, liberty, and dignity above the tiny distractions of life.&#160; We memorialize the moments of our heroes' lives--moments that defined their legacy in God's book.</p>
<p>They raised their hands and swore to defend their country and Constitution. They were so young, then.&#160; I saw a young Marine, yesterday, at his girlfriend's high school graduation.&#160; His dress blues looked so empty.&#160; His face looked so young.&#160; "He looks like he's twelve," my wife said.</p>
<p>They swore to obey the orders of the President of the United States and of officers placed over them.&#160; They entered into a covenant with freedom without reservations or purpose of evasion.&#160; They endured humiliating, painful, exhausting training that seemed worse, to them, than any combat could.&#160; In this, they were wrong, but they had so little to compare against.</p>
<p>My dad returned from World War II and Korea.&#160; Many of my uncles returned from WWII or Korea.&#160; My cousins from Vietnam.&#160; None of these men talk much about their experiences, though my uncle Pat Mahon wrote about his experiences on the Catalinas in WWII.</p>
<p>Psychologists like to say these men, and others like them, are too traumatized by war to speak about it.&#160; Perhaps.&#160; Or perhaps, to them, silence is the greatest tribute to their fellows who didn't return--a statement in and of itself.&#160; What can the living say that's more profound than the actions of their fallen comrades?&#160; Lincoln understood this when he said, "The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here; but it can never forget what they did here."</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. today, please join millions of others in one minute of silence.&#160; Remember what you hear.</p>
