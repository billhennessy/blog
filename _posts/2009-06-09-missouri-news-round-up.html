<p><strong>Lefty Blogger Political Incest</strong></p>
<p>Since the November elections, Missouri state government has been infested with former left-wing bloggers, according to 24th State.&#160; More news on the revolving door between FiredUp and Nixon/Carnahan junta to follow on <a href="http://www.24thstate.com/2009/05/firedup-just-isnt-fun-to-read-anymore.html" target="_blank">24th State blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conservative Heartland Leadership Conference</strong></p>
<p>Dana Loesch and Bill Hennessy were privileged to participate in a Social Media Marketing panel at the<a href="https://www.conservativeheartland.org/" target="_blank"> Conservative Heartland Leadership Conference</a> held at the Millennium Hotel June 3 and 4.&#160; Ed Martin of American Issues Project masterfully pulled together the first annual even which could, someday, rival C-PAC.&#160;&#160; Watch the CHLC web site to stay up-to-date on next year's conference.&#160; If you can't attend, send a high schooler or college student.</p>
<p><strong>Home School Heroes</strong></p>
<p>Dana Loesch and others helped defeat a plot to <a href="http://thedanashow.wordpress.com/2009/05/13/missouri-making-a-huge-grab-for-homeschoolers-rights/" target="_blank">harrass home schoolers</a> in the Missouri legislature.&#160; Congratulations, home schoolers, for this victory.&#160; We should all take this as a reminder that the statists will never stop in their attempts to thwart our liberty. ( A well educated electorate is the <em>last</em> thing the left wants.&#160; )&#160; About 2,000 home schoolers turned out at the Capitol to fight the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Rumor: Jay Nixon Shutting Down Transparency</strong></p>
<p>Rumor has it that Governor Jay Nixon plans to shut down the <a href="http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Portal/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Missouri Accountability Portal </a>to hide his fiscial activities.&#160; The Portal, hailed as the international <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/taxonomy/term/missouri-accountability-portal/" target="_blank">model of government transparenc</a>y, allows citizens to see the check register of every penny spent by state government.&#160; Governor Matt Blunt started the portal as tool allow the people to police Missouri government, so why on Earth would Nixon close it?&#160; Tea Partiers should <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/contact/" target="_blank">write the Governor</a> and their local newspapers, radio and television stations demanding more transparency, not less.</p>
