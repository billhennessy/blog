  content: Tell me Mr. Obama, how would you feel if the ugly remarks made about Sara
    and Todd Palin's daughters by David Letterman were made about your daughters,
    what would the punishment be?   Do the right thing and intervene here.  It's time
    to clean up Television shows and people who prosper from such actions.   No parents
    want their children to have children out of wedlock, but it happens.   Life goes
    on.  You deal with it.  You love them.  But that does NOT mean you will allow
    others to publically abuse them.   This is not a political issue, the Palin Family
    are average people to whom the rest of us average people can relate.  Don't let
    them be the whipping tree for America any longer.

  content: Good for this movement!  I will gladly boycott JandJ, TMobile, Ford, Nissan,
    etc.  This means that I'll also sell my stock in Proctor and Gamble and The Gap....GLADLY!  If
    we all stand together, we'll make this arrogant beast realize how unnecessary
    it is to attack an innocent young woman.   N Pope

  content: Now that I have a list of the sponsor's of David Letterman's show, I will
    gladly join the boycott against each of these companies.  I am now in the process
    of writing letters to these companies to express my sincere displeasure in their
    choice of programming sponsorship. I encourage others to do the same. Let's all
    band together and make it clear that we will make our opinions known. Together
    we can make a difference.

  content: Seems as though they just keep up the double standard of hitting on those
    that do not go along with their way of thinking and especially those they are
    afraid of and attempting to tear down. But this was way off the charts and compares
    to the comments of Don Imus who was fired for the same thing. Until they fire
    Letterman our family WILL boycott his sponsors. In his arrogance he seems to believe
    that he is above any honest apology which has been evidenced. Maybe someone should
    start ragging on his family in order to bring home a point.

  content: Only a comedian could have this much impact on a joke of a politician.  I'm
    amazed that people support the brain-dead Palin.  Is this the best of the Republican/Conservatives?  If
    so, ouch.

    some male dinasaurs who still believe they are entitled to any woman when they
    have weath and power.

  content: I can't buy a Mazda or Toyota? Why not just boycott Letterman's show/products
    directly? Does this mean that all those companies approve of Letterman's comments?
    I think these companies just want more business. (I certainly don't agree with
    Letterman's views.)

  content: This has nothing to do with support for Palin.  It has to do with human
    decency.  He basically called her 14 year old daughter a whore.  Not funny by
    any standard and just plain mean spirited.  This is why I have stopped watching
    Letterman.
