<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9981" title="Secret" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Secret-300x220.jpg" alt="Secret" width="300" height="220" />As a candidate, Barack Obama swore he would throw open the activities of government to light of public scrutiny. &nbsp;In his inauguration, he swore to disclose everything. &nbsp;As President, he has instituted strict rules of secrecy on White House actions--except those of his predecessors.</p>
<p>Now, Newsweek's <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/202875" target="_blank">Michael Isikoff</a>, no friend of the right, notices the incongruity between Obama's promises and his actual openess.</p>
<p>He finds that Obama's openess executive order contains loopholes that the media have ignored until now. &nbsp;For example, the memo requires transparency only "if practicable." &nbsp;More limiting, transparency applies only to "pending legislation," not to the White House's continuing practice legislating by presidential decree.</p>
<p>But Isikoff failed to point out that the White House routine violates the legislation rules. &nbsp;Meetings, memos, and the legislation itself was intentionally hidden from public inspection.</p>
<p>Kudos to Isikoff for having the courage to point out this continuing act of hypocrisy by Obama. &nbsp;Let's hope he keeps it up after the White House revokes Newsweek's press passes.</p>
