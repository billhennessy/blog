  content: "This info on James Hansen is very old news. He was, in fact, fired and
    his work discredited by NASA. Much of the data used for his global warming crap
    was based upon data extrated from a number NASA scientist's work. The data was
    taken out of contex and not used in the manner the scientists had presented in
    the body of their work. These numbers were plugged into Hansen's computer model,
    with other bogus data, which produced his flawed theory. \"Garbage in . . . garbage
    out.\" \n\nThese NASA scientists along with 400 others, all at the top of their
    fields of expertise, presented their findings on global warming to The U.S. Senate
    Republican Committee on Global Warming. A summary report and the full reports
    of each of the 400 scientists were read into the \"The U. S Senate Minority Report
    on Global Warming\" which is now in the Library of Congress. (Google the report
    by name.)\n\nThis body of work disproves all of Hansen and Gore's positions on
    global warming and was available to all Senate and House Democrats. This includes
    then Senator Obama. It fell on deaf ears.\n\n\n\nThis body of work stands in stark
    contrast to that of the 27 scientist who prepared the data for the Hansen/Gore
    Global Warming Junk Science."

<p>Watts Up With That has a graph illustrating the ridiculous extent to which James Hansen has gone to perpetuate his global warming myth.  Hansen has rewritten US temperature data of the past 2 centuries--as if he was there.</p>
<p>It's time for NASA to fire Hansen.  The DOJ should open a fraud investigation. </p>
