    Health care in America costs twice as much per person than in other wealthy countries, e.g., Canada, Australia, Israel, Japan, Norway, France, Italy etc.

    It might be worth the extra expense if we had better health outcomes; but we do not.  In fact, approximately 10% of Americans do not have access to adequate healthcare and it has been estimated that 18,000 to 22,000 die because of this lack.

    No amount of childish ejaculation on your part can change these facts.

    Jeffery,

    Your facts are more suspicious than Biden's hair.  Of that 10 percent a significant number CHOOSE not to buy insurance, a significant number is illegals.  Additional, I could estimate that 18,000 to 22,000 people rise from the dead because of the quality of US medicine.  Meaningless.

    Finally, the US Constitution prohibits government activities not enumerated.  The rule of law means something, whether you and Barack Obama like it or  not.

  content: "Bill,\n\nAh, but I have facts.  And you?  And \"Biden's hair\"; that's
    comedy gold.  Who says Glenn Beck is the only conservative comedian extant??\n\nAccording
    to the CDC, \"The lack of health insurance in America leads to delayed diagnoses,
    life-threatening complications and, ultimately, 18,000 premature deaths each year,
    according to a report released Tuesday by the Institute of Medicine.\"  This report
    was released years ago during the Bush administration.\n\nSome Americans \"choose\"
    not to purchase health insurance for the same reason some Americans \"choose\"
    not to buy a Bentley.  Of the 12-20 million illegals how can 30 million of them
    not access health care?  And hasn't part of your argument been that illegals are
    draining us by using our social safety net?  Which is it; do they or don't they?\n\nHere's
    a simple core question that Republicans refuse to answer (and that you conveniently
    ignored).  Why do Americans pay double what the French, the Israelis, the Australians,
    the Japanese, the Norwegians, the Liechtensteinians etc pay?  The quality of care
    in the US is no better than in those countries.\n\nWhere does that unnecessary
    trillion dollars a year go?  We spend as much each year on excess payments to
    health insurance companies as the TOTAL expenditures on Social Security and Medicare
    COMBINED.  Let that sink in.  And please enumerate the innovations that the profit
    motive in health care insurance has given us.  Higher costs, poorer quality, incomplete
    coverage... which is your favorite?\n\nBut since your argument is not about facts
    but rather ideology, why do you harp on details?  \n\nYour point is that it is
    unconstitutional for the Federal government to be involved in health care because
    it is not enumerated, making at least Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy,
    Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, the Bush's, Clinton, Obama and all US Congresses
    lawbreakers, even criminals.   \n\nSecond easy question for you.  Should Medicare
    and Social Security be dismantled and eliminated?  Why not make that front and
    center of your anti-Fed campaign as it's fully a third of US government outlays
    each year?  End Medicare and Social Security now!  Think of the savings.\n\nFinally,
    (and I'll be sorry for asking) what is your basis for dogmatically stating \"the
    US Constitution prohibits government activities not enumerated\"."

    Jeffery,

    You fall into a classic logical fallacy with your talk of the past presidents: argument from authority (Person X is held in high esteem, considered to be wise or knowledgeable.  Person X says something.  Therefore that thing that person X said is correct, and don't bother to check and see if it really is).  If a thing is wrong or un-Constitutional, it's still wrong or un-Constitutional no matter how many ex-Presidents did it.

    To answer your final question, try reading the 10th Amendment.  Then read the Federalist papers (written by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay....the Constitution's writers, in case you missed them) about Article 2.  That should clear it up.

    Cheers!

    of the Tenth Amendment and Article I?  I was not using them to justify my position

    I, not II didn't you?  That's the one about the commerce clause, where the Supreme
    Court has ruled repeatedly that Congress can enact laws not enumerated.  Regarding
    the Federalist papers, is there an example in them that supports your thesis?
    \ I've read Amendment 10 many times and agree with every Supreme Court.\n\nHow
    do you envision a federal government since apparently every executive, congressperson
    and judge disagrees with your interpretation?  \n\nFinally, what percentage of
    Americans do you estimate agree with your interpretation?"

    Forgot to add:  Read Federalist Paper #44 (Madison)

    You might see why some (actually most) might disagree with you.

    Writes Madison:

    ...1. Of these the first is, the "power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."

    Few parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this; yet on a fair investigation of it, no part can appear more completely invulnerable. Without the substance of this power, the whole Constitution would be a dead letter. Those who object to the article, therefore, as a part of the Constitution, can only mean that the form of the provision is improper. But have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted?...

    ...Had the convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect, the attempt would have involved a complete digest of laws on every subject to which the Constitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the existing state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity may produce; for in every new application of a general power, the particular powers, which are the means of attaining the object of the general power, must always necessarily vary with that object, and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same....

  content: "I was pointing out your flawed logic, not making the argument that everyone
    in history is wrong.  Now you're constructing straw men to use in your defense.
    \ Let me try again....\n\nJust because multiple people, even highly esteemed and
    influential ones, take a certain position does NOT mean that position is correct.
    \ You do no benefit to your position to use this argument from authority to bolster
    it.\n\nYes, I meant article I.  Typo, thanks for pointing it out.  \n\nTo your
    question of percentage of population who agrees or disagrees here, I have no idea.
    \ It hardly matter what percentage of the population agrees with any particular
    point or not.  As before, any number of people can be wrong in exactly the same
    way.  And given that we're a republic, not a democracy, in this country, the opinion
    of the mob really shouldn't have that much sway in Constitutional matters anyway.
    \ Heck, something like a third of the populace of the country supported independence
    and the revolution, but I think we'd all agree that it was the necessary and right
    thing to do (if we'd lost we'd maybe be saying different now, but the victors
    write the history, eh?).\n\nYou got to the Federalist before I could finish this
    comment, but I'm not sure how your quote here bolsters your case.  He's talking
    about the need to empower Congress to pass laws for the purpose of executing its
    Constitutional powers, NOT for the necessity of Congress to do anything it chooses.
    \ He's refuting the notion that some had that every particular miniscule aspect
    of legislation had to be spelled out.  That makes no sense, as he rightly points
    out.  But it's much different to say that Congress should be impowered to make
    laws necessary to execute its duties that are enumerated under Article I than
    it is to say that it can make laws for ANYTHING.  If you deny the principal of
    enumerated powers, then you essentially say that there is no limit to what Congress
    can do.  The Papers are chock full of statements to the effect that the Federal
    government cannot do anything that the Constitution doesn't allow it.  Hamilton's
    arguments against a Bill of Rights in #84 is premised on this fact of Constitutionally
    enumerated powers.  He ended up losing the argument about the bill of rights,
    but at least in part to preclude the usurpations that he worried over, the 10th
    amendment was added as part of them to spell out plainly that federal powers are
    limited to those granted by the Constitution.  It's plain language, and hard to
    mis-read if you ask me.\n\nAs to the commerce clause, don't even get me started
    on that.  Have you ever looked at the convoluted \"reasoning\" used as the justification
    for some of these laws and rulings?  Laughably transparent and almost completely
    without substance is doing them a kindness.  But, those rulings and laws fit with
    the statist's interests, so what politician (who's sole desire is power, don't
    forget) is really going to object to them?\n\nHave a great day,"

    I wonder how many times the current administration has to say and show that illegal immigrants are not going to receive health care before the whiners comprehend.

    The opposition goal is no reform.  I wonder what they would say to someone who cannot afford health insurance.  I know, they'd say, "F*ck 'em."  Right?

    I must say I am quite surprised by the weakness of the arguments made here by those against health care reform.  Could it be that their arguments are so easily revealed as bullshit when read as words that the only "message" they have is an indecipherable drone to drown out those that actually want to have a discussion on the topic?

    As Tom points out where were those "tea baggers" when Bush threw away 1.7 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest 1% of Americans and didn't pay for it?

    Where were they when Bush lied America into an illegal war that has cost us 4331 lives and will end up costing 3 trillion dollars and didn't put it in the budget, borrowing money from China?

    I must have missed the big "tea bagger" protest when Medicare D was passed in the middle of the night handing out billions to drug companies and insurance companies stolen from senior citizens.

    Where was all the outrage over the destruction of the middle class during the Bush years when income disparity rose to overtake the gilded age?

    If you listen to the complaints voiced by the citizens at these tea bagger protests you can quickly get to the bottom of their real complaints: "I want my America back"

    hmmmm....now I wonder what that is code for?

  content: On the corner of McKelvey and Dorsett, almost every day, but especially
    on weekends, I see two elderly ladies on the corner nearest to Walgreens holding
    signs in protest of Obama's socialist agenda.  I honk in support every time I
    see them and one day soon, I will be there to join them.  I think it's a great
    spot especially on the subject of immigration since Maryland Heights is a "comfort
    zone" for illegals.  They walk up and down McKelvey from Dorsett to Page every
    day.  Every apartment complex in maryland Heights is filled with illegals.  A
    lady who owns a business in a small strip mall in the middle of one of these massive
    apartment complexes has told me that she is afraid to leave after dark as there
    are always very shadowy figures just hanging out and violent crime has gotten
    much worse in this area in just a few short years. You can barely get the police
    to respond to a meth lab (right next door to me) so I don't expect them to do
    much about the illegals.  If you pay any attention to the news, you may remember
    a young girl being killed by a hit and run driver that turned out to be drunk
    and illegal.  It was not his first offense.  Right now there are over 10 homes
    for sale in a 4 block area from me, but I'm not moving, I'm fighting back.  You
    can't move away from these problems, instead we need to stand and fight back.

    him that the economy required abundant, affordable energy to prosper.  I recommended

<blockquote>Excerpts of the President&rsquo;s Opening Remarks at Tonight&rsquo;s News Conference<br />President's words in bold.&nbsp; Patriotic response in <i>italics</i>.<br /><b><br />That is why I&rsquo;ve said that even as we rescue this economy from a full-blown crisis</b><br /><i>Obama promised to stop unemployment below 8 percent if stimulus passed.&nbsp; Stimulus passed and unemployment now 9.7 percent heading to 12 percent.&nbsp; If he rescues healthcare like he rescued the economy, we'll all be dead.</i></p>
<p><b>This is not just about the 47 million Americans who have no health insurance. </b><br /><i>Thirty million of whom are ILLEGAL-FRIGGIN-ALIENS!</i></p>
<p><b>And it&rsquo;s about the fact that the biggest driving force behind our federal deficit is the skyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid.</b><br /><i>Then get rid of Medicare and Medicaid!&nbsp; They are both UNCONSTITUTIONAL, Vladimir!</i></p>
<p><b>So let me be clear: if we do not control these costs, we will not be able to control our deficit. </b><br /><i>Really?&nbsp; You quadrupled the deficit in 120 days, you pencil-neck geek!&nbsp; The CBO and every economist outside the West Wing says your socialized medicine scheme will add at least a quarter trillion to that deficit!!!!!!&nbsp; STOP LYING, OBAMA!</i></p>
<p><b>I realize that with all the charges and criticisms being thrown around in Washington, many Americans may be wondering, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in this for me? How does my family stand to benefit from health insurance reform?&rdquo;</b><br /><i>No we're not, you twit.&nbsp; We're asking, "When the hell did America become a communist country?"&nbsp; We're asking, "Why can't we hold a no-confidence vote like the Brits?"&nbsp; We're asking, "Who in the name of God voted for this wicked fool?"</i></p>
<p><b>If you already have health insurance, the reform we&rsquo;re proposing will provide you with more security and more stability. </b><br /><i>BULLS**T!!!!</i> </p>
<p><b>It will keep government out of health care decisions, giving you the option to keep your insurance if you&rsquo;re happy with it. </b><br /><i>LIAR!&nbsp; One new bureaucracy, the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology,&nbsp;will&nbsp;monitor treatments to make sure your doctor is doing what the federal government deems&nbsp;appropriate and&nbsp;cost effective. The goal is to reduce costs and &ldquo;guide&rdquo; your doctor&rsquo;s decisions (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=aLzfDxfbwhzs">pp. 442, 446</a>).</i></p>
<p><b>It will prevent insurance companies from dropping your coverage if you get too sick. </b><br /><i>Unless you're old or infirm (Obama's words)--then you die.</i></p>
<p><i>In reality, you will go to jail unless you buy government's plan (House Bill pp. 167-168).</i></p>
<p><b>I have also pledged that health insurance reform will not add to our deficit over the next decade &ndash; and I mean it.</b><br /><i>LIAR!!! You said that unemployment would not pass 8 percent!&nbsp; You said you would not raise any tax on anyone making less than $250,000! STOP LYING, YOU WEASEL!!!</i><br />&hellip;</p>
<p>Folks, Barack Obama is the bold socialist ever to occupy the White House.&nbsp; If you do not leave the comfort of your home, the relaxation of your damn television, the seat at the ball game to get out into the streets and fight for your freedom like a rabid dog, then you deserve the toilet of a life you'll get.&nbsp; But, dammit, you have business dragging down me, my kids, and the good people who HAVE taken to the streets, written letters, called radio stations for our and your freedom. </p>
<p>Our friend in O'Fallon, MO, would like to organize DAILY PROTESTS FROM NOW UNTIL WE WIN BACK THIS COUNTRY!!! We will blog about this soon.&nbsp; Please get your sign made and your marching shoes on.&nbsp; Go stand on a corner with your sign tonight!!! What the hell is stopping you???????</p>
