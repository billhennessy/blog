    If it hadn't been for an experience I had recently with a very Republican bank executive, I would be able to, in an unqualified way, support the proposition that it is the President choosing to kill business in the US.

    Here is what was explained to me.

    I was in need of a loan to expand my business. We have a good record in the community, and we have collateral. However, the bank, in the name of free enterprise, has decided that the spread it can get by borrowing from the Fed at .25% and purchasing Treasuries is what it wants to do instead of creating jobs in our community.

    This bank executive told me straight out that business is business, and he is making the best decision he can relative to, well, business.

    That he is a Republican and a conservative, and that he has made this decision in opposition to the President's desire for the banks to lend to people just like me who want to expand the economy and provide jobs is, of course, amazing.

    All I can say is labeling the President as the problem, at least in our community, in the face of this fellow's behavior is just wrong.

    I didn't vote for Obama, and I am no fan. However, fair is fair.

    The banks, largely controlled by Republicans, are more than happy to deny funds even to established mid-level businesses with collateral.

    I know that is not how things are supposed to work, but there it is.

    If this bank executive is talking to the President, the President is giving him an argument.

<p>The most disappointing thing about leaving the military is that it usually means leaving the last bastion of leadership in America.&#160; If you open your own business or freelance, you probably don&rsquo;t notice the cowardly bastards populating corner offices in most American enterprises.&#160; You&rsquo;d puke, as Holden Caulfield might say.</p>
<p><strong>John Mackey</strong> of <strong>Whole Foods</strong> had the courage to oppose socialized medicine AND to defend his position and his right to say it. Gina Loudon led a Nationwide Tea Party Coalition <strong>BUYcott</strong> in support of Mackey.&#160; It was a wild success. How many corporate CEOs, COOs, CMOs, CIOs, or CFOs stood behind Mackey?</p>
<p>None. Because 99 percent of business executives are myopic cowards. They would rather strap on knee pads and crawl to the White House to beg Prince Barack for scraps from Andy Stern&rsquo;s bounteous plate than to stand on their own two feet and say, &ldquo;You, Mr. President, are destroying the American job engine.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.&#160; Maybe all you enterprise executives save puppies from burning buildings in your spare time.&#160; Maybe you jump on private jets to Afghanistan and kill jihadis when you leave the office, sleeping on the flight home. Maybe you&rsquo;re not self-serving cowards.</p>
<p>Prove it. </p>
<p><strong>Comment on this post</strong>.&#160; Tell St. Louis and America who you are, the company you help run, and what you&rsquo;re doing to stop the socialization of America?&#160; </p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t bother if you&rsquo;re going to tell me you give $2,000 to Republican candidates every year.&#160; The Republicans allowed this disaster to come about.&#160; The GOP made Barack Obama&mdash;the Democrats are too screwed up to to that. </p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you in the streets?&#160; Why aren&rsquo;t you funding conservative activist groups the way George Soros, Eric Schmidt, and Mark Cuban fund the commies?&#160; Why don&rsquo;t you take a stand even at the expense of a few customers?&#160; Mackey did it, and we stood behind him.&#160; Where the hell are you?&#160; Why aren&rsquo;t you belittling and ridiculing the White House&rsquo;s anti-liberty schemes instead of licking Obama&rsquo;s boots at a White House photo op?</p>
<p>Tell us here, you brave, tough leaders.&#160; Tell us.&#160; Tell us, because we&rsquo;re looking for someone to rally behind.&#160; We want another Mackey to buy from.&#160; We are ready to shop YOUR STORES.&#160; We&rsquo;re just looking for a few good leaders!&#160; </p>
<p>Yes, there are a few brave men and women among you. Damn few, though. Damn few. You want to know why ACORN and SEIU and all the other leftists keep shaking you down?&#160; Because you&rsquo;re cowards, and you pay. No one in his right mind would buy stock in ANY company in America that&rsquo;s run by a weasel who praises free markets, then bows to our socialist prince.&#160; Your profits are solely in the short term.&#160; You and your company are doomed to destruction because you are failing in your fiduciary duties.</p>
<p>Prove me wrong.&#160; Show us what you&rsquo;re made of, if it&rsquo;s anything but tapioca pudding.&#160; Comment.&#160; Go public.&#160; We don&rsquo;t shop in shady back rooms.&#160; Man up and act like Americans. </p>
<p>Comments section is open.&#160; Use it, ya weasels. </p>
