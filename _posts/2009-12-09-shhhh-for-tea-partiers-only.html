<p>I dwell on this too much, but my new ebook--<a href="http://wp.zenconservatism.com/store/#ecwid:category=151234&amp;mode=product&amp;product=313707">Zen Conservatism--is now available</a>.&#160; Currently, you'll have to pay by<a href="http://wp.zenconservatism.com/store/#ecwid:category=151234&amp;mode=product&amp;product=313707"><img style="border-bottom:black 1px solid;border-left:black 1px solid;border-top:black 1px solid;border-right:black 1px solid;margin:5px;" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1889" title="ZenCon235x195" alt="ZenCon235x195" src="http://stlouisteaparty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ZenCon235x195.png" width="235" height="195" /></a>Google Checkout.</p>
<p>The hard launch is scheduled for Monday, December 14, but I wanted to make the ebook available to St. Louis Tea Partiers early AND at a discount of only $6.50. (It will go up to $9.50 on Monday.)</p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="http://wp.zenconservatism.com/store/#ecwid:category=151234&amp;mode=product&amp;product=313707">Zen Conservatism ebook</a>, you can register now to become <a href="http://wp.zenconservatism.com/3-surefire-ways-to-be-happier-healthier-and-more-effective-in-3-5-minutes-a-day/">Happier, Healthier, and More Effective in just 3 Minutes a Day</a>.&#160; Become a Positive Journalist on&#160; <a href="http://wp.zenconservatism.com/">zenconservatism.com.</a> Read this article and follow the links inside.&#160; My goal is to have 1,000 people enter 30 positive stories before St. Patrick's Day.&#160; You can start today, even without buying a book.&#160; (Offer will end soon, so hurry if you want to blog without registering.)</p>
<p>Finally, thank you, all of you, for the most amazing year of my life.&#160; I start writing this book a week after the 2008 elections.&#160; I was writing to myself at first, but then I heard so much fear and anger that I decided to make it a book.&#160; Then the Tea Party started, and . . . well, I just didn't have the time to finish it.&#160; I took some time off of the Tea Party in October to dust off the file and wrap it up.&#160; I hope you like it.&#160; I know some of you will disagree with parts of it, and some might be disappointed with my honesty.&#160; I can't help that--I don't think you'd want me any other way.</p>
<p>Thanks,    <br />Bill</p>
