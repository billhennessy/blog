<p>John is a Vietnam veteran and retired business executive.&#160; He loves America and hates to see what&rsquo;s happened in Washington the past few years.&#160; He believes in liberty and Constitutional limitations on government growth.&#160; </p>
<p>He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if it&rsquo;s just him. </p>
<p>Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bond&rsquo;s (R-MO) office in Washington.&#160; He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.&#160; </p>
<p>According to John, the Bond staffer who answered the phone was terse, rude, and argumentative.&#160; She balked at being called a &ldquo;lady,&rdquo; though she couldn&rsquo;t think of an acceptable alternative. She hung up on the constituent and veteran twice.&#160; She threatened to call the police if he called back.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s offense?&#160; He had the audacity to ask about the earmark and state his view that Bond and his staff are our employees.&#160; </p>
<p>I was not able to speak to anyone at Bond&rsquo;s office to confirm, but John&rsquo;s story wasn&rsquo;t the first like it.&#160; Senator Bond, one of the biggest porkers in Congress, has a reputation for being rude to constituents . . . unless, of course, they come bearing campaign contributions.&#160; Now that he&rsquo;s retiring from the Senate, even donors are in trouble.</p>
<p>Bond&rsquo;s local office was more polite to John, but they still argued with him, claiming John&rsquo;s assessment of Bond&rsquo;s political career was unfair.&#160; </p>
<p>John contrasted for me his treatment with Senator Claire McCaskill&rsquo;s (D-MO) office staff.&#160; McCaskill&rsquo;s people were not only polite, they were polite while arguing policy with John.&#160; While John admits he can be short and direct, he felt that never went there with McCaskill&rsquo;s polite, professional, and enthusiastic staff.</p>
<p>Now, I agree with Sen. Bond on most issues and I disagree with McCaskill on just about everything.&#160; (Same for Tea Partier John.)&#160; Where John and I have more in common with Claire than with Bond is on the point of customer service.&#160; Claire understands how to treat constituents on the phone; Bond simply does not.</p>
<p>Want to know why the Tea Party is viewed more favorably than the Republican Party?&#160; This story tells it all.&#160; </p>
<p>Wake up, GOP.&#160; You&rsquo;re on the road to losing seats in 2010 rather than gaining them.</p>
