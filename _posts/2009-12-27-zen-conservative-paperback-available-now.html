<p>I began this book in December 2008, just after the election.&nbsp; My goal was to produce a book that would inspire people to restore our republic.&nbsp; At the time, conservatives were disheartened, dismayed, and distracted.</p>
<p>Then the Tea Party movement began, and I had to put my book project on hold.<br />
But thanks to your work, I've been able to return to my project.&nbsp; I've updated the original work with things I've learned in the Tea Party movement, but the basic idea remains the same:&nbsp; focus on the most important things and be happy while you do it.<br />
<b>I hope this book helps you (and all of us) reclaim our freedom without losing our souls</b><br />
If you would like the book, you can order online here (<a href="https://www.createspace.com/3417300">$1 from each purchase goes to St. Louis Tea Party</a>)&nbsp; or from<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Conservatism-Reclaim-liberty-without/dp/1449959040/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261857751&amp;sr=8-2"> Amazon.com</a>.&nbsp; I'd be more than happy to sign it at the next event.&nbsp; I hope to have a book signing in January.</p>
<p>The book will be available in bookstores every in January, but why wait?&nbsp; You can get it now for just $14.95 (plus shipping and handling).</p>
