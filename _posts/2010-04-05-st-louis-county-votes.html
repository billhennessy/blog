<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, April 6, is Election Day in St. Louis County.&#160; In some places, especially throughout South County, the only measure on the ballot is Proposition A: a sales tax increase. </p>
<p>Prop A&rsquo;s backers&mdash;principally County Exec Charlie Dooley and Chesterfield Mayor John Nations&mdash;claim this tax increase of up to $650 per family will allow Metro to grow. You know otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dooley and Nations cannot point to a specific plan.&#160; They point to four.&#160; </li>
<li>They cannot tell you how much any of the four plans costs.&#160; They tell you, &ldquo;a lot more than we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;&#160; </li>
<li>They cannot tell you that Proposition A will cover the cost of expansion. It will not.&#160; </li>
<li>They cannot tell you Proposition A won&rsquo;t pay for the sins of the past. It will.&#160; </li>
<li>They cannot tell you that Proposition A will be enough to run Metro for five years without another tax increase.&#160; It won&rsquo;t.&#160; </li>
<li>They cannot tell you that Proposition A will make lives of the poor and disabled better.&#160; It won&rsquo;t </li>
<li>Dooley and Nations cannot give you one positive reason to raise your taxes. They can only give excuses. </li>
</ul>
<p>In short, Proposition A is just another progressive strategy for taking your money and giving it to politicians to spent.</p>
<p> <strong>Vote No on Proposition A on Tuesday, April 6. No excuses. </strong></p>
