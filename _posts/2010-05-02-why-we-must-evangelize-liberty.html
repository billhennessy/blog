    "Evangelism" comes from the Greek word 'angelos' or 'messenger.'  It's the same root word as the word 'angel' or messengers of God.  In the Old Testament, the  Lord sends his messengers, the Prophets to the people, and they kill them.  He sends his own Son and the people kill him.  The Son sends forth the Apostles, also from the Greek, meaning 'the one sent forth.' They also, were killed by the people, except for John, 'The Theologian.'

    Many people think that the Apostles were aggressively engaging people as they spread Christianity in their evangelical missions.  The Eastern Church, has, however, preserved the accounts of the Apostles entering communities and following the direction of the Holy Spirit, engaging those to whom they were directed, living an example of Christ's message that so impressed the local population so that they wanted to learn more about The Annointed One.  It was not their persuasion that won converts, but their example which visibly set them apart from others' behaviors.

    The example of the Tea Party, while much maligned in the MSM, is a powerful one.  As powerful a contemporary witness to free assembly and free speech as and ever produced in this country.  To our skeptical neighbors, coworkers and friends, the message that engages them permanently may be, "come and see democracy in action, and meet the people who are committed to freedom.  They are like you and me.  Come and see."

    The truth and wisdom of this approach is borne out by the research of Dr. Rodney Stark, a sociologist, who has done work on the effectiveness of evangelistic approaches, including door to door appeals.  Mormon missionaries, for all of the hours invested, have the lowest rate of actual conversion.  Dr. Stark also studied the 'Moonies' from the time they entered the United States, and found that conversion was driven by the example of the people who were Moonies.

    Those most likely to convert in any case, are those who were'unchurched'or in the case of Liberty, those who do are not politically engaged are more likely to convert and become engaged than those who are already engaged in a political party. Your apathetic neighbor, or your 'middle of the road' or 'independent' neighbor may be more likely to become engaged if they will 'come and see' than anyone else.  People dissatisfied with the government are also potentially 'converts.'  Demonstrating a behavior that they also admire, like defending the rights of others, is more likely to engage someone who is skeptical about the Tea Party.

    It is the straw dog of bigotry so successfully repeated by the MSM that has alienated people from conservative principals.  It can just as effectively be used in a one-on-one conversation to build a bridge of respect between yourself and people otherwise unengaged.  It is the one-on-one relationships that must be cultivated to grow the engagement.

    Without presenting an 'organized' presence, individuals in patriotic shirts or hats, volunteering where ever possible in your community and demonstrating your humanity without handing out materials, but by being engaged with others, is probably the most effective way to expand the presence of Tea Party acceptance and invite others.  It's not a political party, is is the conscience of America.

<p>At Tea Party marches and rallies, we are surrounded by others who understand and cherish liberty.&#160; We know the horrors that occur when a government loses accountability to and, yes, fear of the people they govern.&#160; Such regimes become murderous, intolerant, and repressive. We know that such a regime in North America is just as dangerous as in Southeast Asia or Europe.&#160; </p>
<p>What we often forget is that millions of our fellow Americans don&rsquo;t understand these things.&#160; Public education, and even many private schools, have filled people&rsquo;s heads with nonsense. The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers have spent decades removing First Principles from our nation&rsquo;s classrooms.&#160; They have largely succeeded.</p>
<p>If we are to begin making fundamental changes in America, we must get out and introduce ourselves and our principles to those who have been enslaved by ignorance.&#160; We need to let our neighbors know that we don&rsquo;t have horns, we&rsquo;re not out to destroy them, and that our principles will allow them to achieve degrees of prosperity and happiness they never dreamed possible. </p>
<p>When the call comes, please be prepared to assemble your teams and his the streets in your neighborhood.&#160; Help us spread the good news of liberty to your block.&#160; In return, you&rsquo;ll get the peace of mind of know you emancipated a human being.&#160; You&rsquo;ll also get a government you desire and deserve.</p>
<p>Not bad for a day&rsquo;s work, huh?</p>
