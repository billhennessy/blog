<p>A truer leader never walked this land</p>

<p>In human relations, there is a fixed ratio between leaders and those they lead.</p>
<p>The people trust leaders as much as the leader trusts the people.</p>
<p>In my lifetime, no leader ever trusted me as much as Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>And I have trusted no leader as much as I trusted him.</p>
<p>And we never even met.</p>
