<p>The Obama Justice Department is quietly investigating the lawyers associated with the John Adams Project who may have violated a number of laws in place to protect our covert operatives and their families. But so far, with few exceptions, the media and their friends on Capitol Hill haven&rsquo;t found this case nearly as interesting as Valerie Plame. Could it have anything to do with the ideological bent of the perpetrators?</p>
<p>Great piece, Mr. Akin, and welcome to Big Government.&#160; </p>
