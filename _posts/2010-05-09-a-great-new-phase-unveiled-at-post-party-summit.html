<p>Ned Ryun, President of <a href="http://americanmajority.org/">American Majority</a>, has opened a new chapter in America&rsquo;s conservative grassroots movement. </p>
<p>On Saturday, a crowd of several hundred 9-12 Project and Tea Party organizers heard Ryun explain why it&rsquo;s time to move beyond the rallies at the <a href="http://www.the-912-project.com/2010/05/09/a-recap-of-the-american-majority-post-party-summit-in-kansas-city/">American Majority Post-Party Summit in Kansas City</a>.&#160; I have mentioned this before, and it seems to bother many people. I understand why.&#160; </p>

<p>The rally was the animating function of the Tea Party movement.&#160; We gathered.&#160; On February 27, 2009, we gather in about 40 cities.&#160; On March 13 of that year, we gathered in homes and taverns to watch Glenn Beck&rsquo;s &ldquo;We Surround Them&rdquo; program, and the 9-12 Project was born. On April 15, over one millions people gathered in 200 places to tell Washington, &ldquo;We made you; we can un-make you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Rallies taught all of us that we are not alone. But our rallies were recruitment and training.&#160; They were not &ldquo;action&rdquo; in the military sense.&#160; Rallies, like parades and passes-in-review, are internal functions to increase esprit de corps.&#160; </p>
<p>General McClellan believed in recruitment and training.&#160; And training and training and practicing and waiting. He hesitated. He waited for the perfect moment.&#160; He fought tiny battles of little or no strategic consequence. </p>
<p>Lincoln fired McClellan <a href="http://www.historynet.com/the-roar-and-rattle-mcclellans-missed-opportunities-at-antietam.htm">after the battle of Antietam</a>, McClellan&rsquo;s greatest victory.&#160; Antietam was a rally. Lincoln wanted victory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to march. It&rsquo;s time to elect the rightward-most, viable candidate for every office in every district in every state.&#160; The time for entertaining each other is long over.</p>
<p>When I worked at Anheiser-Busch, they told me, &ldquo;Everything you do will either make more beer or sell more beer. If you can&rsquo;t figure out how something you&rsquo;re doing contributes to one of those two ends, stop and ask. Either we didn&rsquo;t train you right, or you&rsquo;re doing the wrong thing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In our present battle, everything we do must contribute to flipping Congress.&#160; If you can&rsquo;t figure out how your activism contributes to that end, please stop and ask someone. Because if Obama keeps the Congress, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what happens in the states&mdash;we are all screwed. </p>
<p>P.S. If you have not been to one of the <a href="http://summit.americanmajority.org/">Post-Party Summits</a>, do yourself and America a favor and get to the last one: <a href="http://ppsindianapolis.eventbrite.com/">May 14-15 in Indianapolis, IN</a>. This is the best conservative grassroots conference I&rsquo;ve attended.&#160; It is a bargain. </p>
