<p>Earlier, I wrote about a little trick for <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2010/05/10/how-to-be-happier/">making your day a little happier</a> than it otherwise would have been. Now, there are a lot of reasons why I should wish to make you happier. But I have to admit that there&rsquo;s something in it for me.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t get 3 cents every time someone registers on <a href="http://thankfulfor.com">ThankfulFor.com</a>.&#160; But as a member of several grassroots organizations trying to change America, I want my teammates to be in the best possible spirits.&#160; For one thing, happier people are usually more fun to be around. More importantly, though, science tells us that happier people perform better.</p>
<p><strong>The Physician Study</strong></p>
<p>Happiness improves mental (cognitive) task performance. In one study, doctors were given a test. The physicians had to diagnose conditions based on symptoms as quickly as possible. They were graded on speed and accuracy. But first, the doctors were segmented into 3 groups. Group A was primed for happiness. Group B was primed for cognition by reading descriptions of the very diseases they were about to diagnose. Group C was not primed at all.</p>
<p>The results?</p>
<p>Groups B and C performed about the same. But the doctors primed to be happy blew them both out of the water. Group A was 50 percent fast and 80 percent more accurate. So if you're sick, find the happiest doctor, not the smartest one.</p>
<p><strong>And How Does This Apply to the Grassroots?</strong></p>
<p>Over a year ago, I started drawing a rough chart of how our moods should change over time:</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Untitleddrawing2.png"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;" title="Untitleddrawing (2)" border="0" alt="Untitleddrawing (2)" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Untitleddrawing2_thumb.png" width="482" height="239" /></a> </p>
<p>When we started on February 27, 2009, we were full of anger.&#160; Our solutions were very simple: gather and shout.&#160; </p>
<p>By election day 2010, we need to be mostly solutions.&#160; Solutions are much more difficult to advance than anger is to express.&#160; That&rsquo;s why a lot of people feel lost and argumentative right now.&#160; In fact, I think some folks are resisting the change from high anger to high solutions. That&rsquo;s understandable, too.&#160; But it&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>For the rest of 2010, we need to execute a strategy that results in more people voting for liberty than for despotism.&#160; That requires everyone on the right being on top of his or her game.&#160; Like the doctors who were 50 percent faster and 80 percent more accurate, must execute with minimal friction. Anger and in-fighting are the worst kind of friction. </p>
<p>So <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2010/05/10/how-to-be-happier/">try happiness for 21 days</a>.&#160; If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can also get pissed off at me and return it for a full refund of rancor. But I know you&rsquo;ll like happy better.&#160; </p>
