<p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/sites/tv/img/8350_happy_face.jpg" width="240" height="240" /> Happiness is a choice; anger is a tactic. </p>
<p>Anger will have to wait for a future post.&#160; This one is about happiness. So let me ask: would you do something that took less than a minute if that something would make you happier? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html" target="_blank">Martin Seligman</a> at University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s school of <a href="http://www.bdp-gus.de/gus/Positive-Psychologie-Aufruf-2000.pdf" target="_blank">Positive Psychology</a> has broken down happiness in more scientifically measurable components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive Emotion </li>
<li>Engagement </li>
<li>Purpose </li>
</ul>
<p>Other research has shown how to increase your happiness score.&#160; Before we discuss that, though, let&rsquo;s dispel some notions.</p>
<p>When we talk about increasing your happiness, we don&rsquo;t mean eliminating the bad or troubled things in your life. What we mean is increasing the happiness.&#160; You can be despite your troubles&mdash;look at Job and Mother Teresa.&#160; </p>
<p>Nor do we mean that you will rate yourself as &ldquo;Hap- Hap- Happy!&rdquo; if someone asks, &ldquo;How you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Before you wander away, though, consider this: if you do this thing for 30 seconds to a minute every day, early in the morning, at each point during the day, after each interaction, you will be happier than you&rsquo;d have been if you hadn&rsquo;t done this simple thing.&#160; </p>
<p>Even better, if you do this for 21 days in a row, the effects will last for six months.&#160; </p>
<p>Now, are you ready to be happier? Then here&rsquo;s how.&#160; </p>
<p>Every morning, write down five things your thankful for.&#160; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.&#160; If you want to get a reminder, <a href="http://thankfulfor.com/" target="_blank">register here</a> and they&rsquo;ll send you an email if you go twenty-four hours without recording things you&rsquo;re thankful for.</p>
<p>This works by instructing your subconscious mind to notice and note things that are positive.&#160; These could be very little things, like a little boy trying to close the tailgate of a very large SUV.&#160; </p>
<p>As you catalog more and more positive things in your life, you&rsquo;ll arm yourself with more and more solutions.&#160; But if you only recognize problems, then you&rsquo;re armed with more and more problems.</p>
<p>Try this for twenty-one days.&#160; If you&rsquo;re not satisfied, post comment.&#160; If you are satisfied post a comment.</p>
<p>BONUS:&#160; If you really want to make a difference, consider sharing the things you&rsquo;re grateful for.&#160; Tweet them or post them on facebook.&#160; <a href="http://thankfulfor.com/" target="_blank">ThankfulFor.com</a> makes this easy.</p>
