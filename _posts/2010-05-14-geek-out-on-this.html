<p>This eighteen minute presentation synthesizes almost everything I believe about leadership and inspiration. </p>
<p><strong>We own Why</strong>&#160; </p>
<p>We believe that God's law trumps Man's, and that the Constitution trumps Congress. And the President. And the courts.&#160; We believe that each one of us has the will and the capacity to dream our own dreams, live our own lives, and die our own noble deaths without government assistance or government contraints.&#160; We believe that our destiny is just that: ours.&#160; </p>
<p>And &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE0iPY7XGBo" target="_blank">we shall pay any price</a>, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We could use a man like John Fitzgerald Kennedy today. John Kennedy, who spoke of our &ldquo;belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God,&rdquo;&#160; would surely be proud that a Boston tradition of rebellion against despotism lives on today all across our country.</p>
<p>So ask yourself why you do what you do.&#160; Why do you believe what you believe.&#160; And tell the world why you do and believe as you do.&#160; The sound of freedom is irresistible: spread it far and wide.</p>
