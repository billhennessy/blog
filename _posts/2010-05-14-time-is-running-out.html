<p><a href="http://www.timburnsforcongress.com/">Money Bomb for Tim Bur</a>ns ends at 11:00 p.m. Central tonight!&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/jtowntea1.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;margin-left:0;border-top:0;margin-right:0;border-right:0;" title="jtowntea[1]" border="0" alt="jtowntea[1]" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/jtowntea1_thumb.jpg" width="103" height="79" /></a> If you want the satisfaction of replacing pork-barreler and Marine-basher, John Murtha, with <a href="http://www.timburnsforcongress.com/index2.php">fiscal conservative Tim Burns</a>, then contributing to the money bomb will help.</p>
<p>If you have friends or family in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional district, you might want to give them a call this weekend and ask them if they plan to vote in Tuesday&rsquo;s election. (People who are asked if they intend to vote are 40 percent more likely to vote than those who are not asked (<a href="http://influenceatwork.com/Media/RBC/E_Brand_principles.pdf">Cialdini</a>).) Make sure they&rsquo;ve looked at where <a href="http://www.timburnsforcongress.com/html/issues.html">Tim Burns stands on the issues</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, this important election to fill Murtha&rsquo;s seat is Tuesday, May 18.</p>
