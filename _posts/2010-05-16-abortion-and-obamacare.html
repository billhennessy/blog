<p>In Tennessee and Arizona, insurance exchanges created under ObamaCare are barred from covering abortions. Pro-life groups claim this trend will continue as more states realize that the bill passed earlier this year allows states to block abortion coverage by private exchanges. (Missouri&rsquo;s legislature sent a similar measure to Gov. Jay Nixon.) </p>

<p>Pro-abortion members of Congress are incensed, according to the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/16/abortion-opponents-capitalizing-new-health-care-law/" target="_blank">Associated Press and Fox News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Implementation of this reform should be about increasing access to health care and increasing choices, not taking them away," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a member of the Senate leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expect the White House to close this loop with strong-arm tactics.&#160; When insurance companies discovered that ObamaCare permitted insurance companies to exclude children with pre-existing conditions, HHS Secretary <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303410404575152100463512126.html" target="_blank">Kathleen Sebelius simply dictated</a> the loophole closed.&#160; Sheepish insurance companies yielded.</p>
<p>Dictatorships <em>are</em> efficient. They are also inhumane. </p>
