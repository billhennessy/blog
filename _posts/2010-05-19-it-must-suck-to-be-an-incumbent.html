<p>Whether you&rsquo;re the party darling or the federal office holder, 2010 is shaping up to be your&nbsp; last year in politics.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, Tea Party Republican, Rand Paul, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20005354-503544.html" target="_blank">opened a can of whoop-ass</a> on Republican party favorite, Trey Grayson. No single race proves the strength or impact of the Tea Party, but races like Paul&rsquo;s demonstrate that the right candidate with the right campaign team with the strong backing of the Tea Party and 9-12 Project can blow away the party candidate. Don&rsquo;t read anymore into it.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t read too much into the PA12 race to fill Jack Murtha&rsquo;s seat. This race involved a single district in Pennsylvania where Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one.&nbsp; Tim Burns's opponent ran to the right of Ronald Reagan:&nbsp; pro-life, pro-gun, anti-ObamaCare, and anti-Cap and Trade.&nbsp; Critz also was credited with being shovel man in Murtha's pork-barrel filling operation.</p>
<p>Additionally, thanks to traditional Republican circular firing squads, there were <a href="http://twitter.com/JayCost/statuses/14267608073" target="_blank">approximately 16,000 under votes in the special election</a>.&nbsp; Yesterday, Burn was not only the GOP candidate in the special election, but he was on the Primary ballot against establishment Republican, Bill Russell, for this November&rsquo;s general.&nbsp; It seems <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/55784/pa-12-results-are-bad-gop-just-how-bad" target="_blank">Russell&rsquo;s supporters were encouraged not to vote in the special election.</a> It's difficult for a Republican to beat both a Republican and a Democrat.</p>
<p>Russell's strategy backfired.&nbsp; He's losing the primary race to Burns.&nbsp; But he did succeed in ensuring Burns will face an incumbent Democrat.&nbsp; Way to go, Einstein.</p>
<p>Across PA, RINO-<em>cum</em>-Democrat, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/morning-fix/1-2-3-4.html" target="_blank">Arlen Specter lost soundly to Any Democrat</a>.&nbsp; In this case, Any Democrat was played by Congressman Jay Sestak.&nbsp; (Pronounced: who cares?) This commercial explains why cynicism, even naked cynicism, won&rsquo;t cell in 2010:</p>

<p>In Arkansas, it appears <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jA3RK25168k9lJMBWEsmJL15qQ5gD9FPMCQ00" target="_blank">Blanche Lincoln&rsquo;s career will be decided by a&nbsp; run-off</a> in June.</p>
<p>So what does it all mean?</p>
<p>1. Incumbents and party favors are out</p>
<p>2. Money can still buy votes</p>
<p>3. Republicans are still the only people who can beat Republicans&mdash;and they do it very well.</p>
<p>4. Pat Toomey (PA) and Rand Paul (KY) will be freshman Senators together next January.</p>
