<p>On December 28, 2008,&nbsp; I published my predictions for 2009.&nbsp; I should have graded myself in January, but I was still on hiatus from Hennessy&rsquo;s View.&nbsp; So let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>The Dow</strong>:&nbsp; The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:&nbsp; D. The average would be a pain to figure out, but <a href="http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/so-it-begins-moody-s-warns-us-credit-rating-fears" target="_blank">it looks like</a> it was closer 9800.</p>
<p><strong>GDP and Economy</strong>:&nbsp; By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation "Great Depression II."&nbsp; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall.&nbsp; Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q1</strong>:&nbsp; -.06</p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>: -1.5</p>
<p><strong>Q3</strong>: -6.5</p>
<p><strong>Q4</strong>: -2.0</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B.&nbsp; The combination of unemployment and GDP followed my track except that Q1 actual was worse than I predicted and Q3 better<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>US Treasuries: </strong>Moody&rsquo;s warns investors in US Treasuries that inflation could erode the real value of the paper dramatically but falls short of lowering bond ratings.&nbsp; China and Japan sell over $1 trillion in long-term US debt.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:&nbsp; C+.&nbsp; Moodys did release <a href="http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/so-it-begins-moody-s-warns-us-credit-rating-fears" target="_blank">several warning</a> about US debt hurting Treasury ratings, and China was a net seller most of the year.&nbsp; I overshot the amount of treasury sales by China and Japan&mdash;by a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Industry</strong>:&nbsp; The bridge loan isn&rsquo;t enough and the UAW refuses major compromises, but Obama and Congress block GM and Chrysler from bankruptcy.&nbsp; Instead, Congress authorizes $70 billion in exchange for voting stock and a seat on the companies&rsquo; boards.&nbsp; The companies oblige, effectively becoming government agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:&nbsp; B+.&nbsp; Everything happened as I predicted, but the companies went through bankruptcy anyway.&nbsp; On this, I was overly optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>Iraq</strong>:&nbsp; The slow drawdown of troops will continue according to the plan approved by Iraq in 2008.&nbsp; The net effect of Obama&rsquo;s win on Iraq is zero.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:&nbsp; A.</p>
<p><strong>Iran</strong>:&nbsp; The Obama administration achieves a pyrrhic victory by signing a non-proliferation agreement with Iran similar to the one Clinton (via Carter) signed with North Korea.&nbsp; By the end of 2009, Iran&rsquo;s cheating is obvious, but both the US and UN ignore it . . . until it&rsquo;s too late.&nbsp; Israel acts alone.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: D.&nbsp; Israel hasn&rsquo;t attacked Iran, obviously.&nbsp; Obama got way too friendly with Iran, but he&rsquo;s backed off.</p>
<p><strong>Key Legislation: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fairness Doctrine</strong> returns requiring television and radio stations to provide equal time to all sides of any news or science issue with the exception of climate science.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: F</p>
<p><strong>Emission Standards</strong> increased dramatically by Congress and rubber-stamped by GM and Chrysler boards.&nbsp; Ford sues claiming unfair competition and anti-trust violations.&nbsp; Suit will take years to settle.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: A</p>
<p><strong>Unions</strong> can demand to know a non-union&rsquo;s position on unionization votes.&nbsp; Many shops turn union; many anti-union workers are assaulted and threatened.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: F</p>
<p><strong>Medical workers</strong> are compelled to participate in abortions regardless of religious or personal beliefs.&nbsp; Thousands of doctors and nurses quit in protest.&nbsp; The Catholic church closes thousands of hospitals creating the greatest healthcare availability crisis ever in a post-industrial country.&nbsp; Congress prepares, by year&rsquo;s end, to take over the healthcare industry and all medical universities and colleges.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong> F</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>: D</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sports</strong></p>
<p>Several major professional sports teams fold as advertising dollars disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: F</p>
<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>
<p>No one really cares after reading the list above.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Michael Jackson died.</p>
<p><strong>Politics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Newt Gingrich</strong> prepares a presidential run in 2012 by quarterbacking a team of more than 200 Republican Congressional candidates on single agenda to win back Washington and capitalism.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Newt will run.&nbsp; He just didn&rsquo;t quarterback the Congressional Win-Back.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Change</strong>:&nbsp; 2008 was the coolest year in almost 20 years, and 2009 looks to be even cooler.&nbsp; A major flaw is revealed in the most sophisticated models.&nbsp; James Hansen refuses to admit he was wrong, but even the media stop covering climate change.&nbsp; Environmentalism shifts to potable water, an actual problem that will affect the US in 20 years as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogallala_Aquifer">Ogallala Aquifer</a> dries up.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:&nbsp; A++.&nbsp; How could I have known that <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100017393/climategate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-anthropogenic-global-warming/" target="_blank">ClimateGate</a> was coming down the pipe?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; You believe that?&nbsp; Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Composite</strong>:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give myself a C.</p>
