    The bill, sponsored by Earl Pomeroy ("At-large" and only Congressman for ND), is H.R. 3936, with the misleading title, "Preserve Benefits and Jobs Act of 2009."  If you look up this bill, and get the full text PDF from the General Printing Office, you will not only find that it is 106 pages long, but in searching the bill for the terms "union", "labor", "local", "SEIU", "AFL-CIO", they were not to be found.  Scanning the bill, I realized it was craftily written and thoroughly opaque, consisting of "replace the word 'A', section 'B', paragraph 'C', subsection 'D', with the word(s) 'X', and inserting a new section to be titled 'Y'...you get the idea.  COMPLETELY inscrutable to this mature and literate citizen.

    I wish I could confirm, for myself, what this bill does.  (Honestly, I am not going to live long enough.)  If it does what is alleged, since my "Republican" Congresswoman's husband is a lawyer, registered at the Missouri Ethics Commission website as a lobbyist for 12 unions, including two AFL-CIO affiliates, and my "Republican" Congresswoman is one of the 44 cosponsors of this bill, I think this is just a tad questionable.

<blockquote><p>Although right now taxpayers could possibly be on the hook for $165 billion, the liability could essentially be unlimited because these pensions have to be paid out until the workers die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember why we took to the streets for the first Tea Party Protests in 2009?&#160; It was bailouts. And those were bailouts of organizations that, at least, employed people. </p>
<p>Now the federal government is taking our money&mdash;our children&rsquo;s money&mdash;to bail out the SEIU?&#160; </p>
<p>SEIU and other big labor unions are in financial straights because they&rsquo;ve siphoned <strike>billions</strike>&#160; <a href="http://www.aier.org/research/briefs/1550-obama-thanks-his-friends-government-spending-and-union-support">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> from their members&rsquo; pensions to bribe lawmakers like <a href="http://casey.senate.gov/contact/">Bob Casey</a>.&#160; Now they what you to reimburse the workers.</p>
<p>I say it&rsquo;s time for the union rank and file to turn on their union bosses who squandered pension money to buy political influence.&#160; And they should start with Andy Stern. </p>
