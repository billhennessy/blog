<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jumpingmoon1.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="jumping-moon" border="0" alt="jumping-moon" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jumpingmoon_thumb1.jpg" width="240" height="191" /></a> A friend of mine explained an interesting theory to me the other day. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The natural tendency of the universe is to level everything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This entropic force leads us to just &lsquo;go with the flow.&rsquo;&#160; But what makes us human&mdash;what built civilization and made man noble&mdash;was when we finally <em>resisted</em> entropy.&#160; When we built a levy to keep our village from flooding, or when we learned to lure and trap, then farm, animals instead of tracking them.&#160; Those were acts of resistance.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Fascinating.&#160; And it rings true. And everything worth doing meets up against resistance.&#160; The universe likes disorder, and man&rsquo;s attempts to stand athwart entropy, yelling &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; just piss it off.</p>
<p>But we do it anyway. </p>
<p>And in standing up to the universe, we take a great risk. </p>
<p>Another way to describe this act of resistance is <em>raising standards</em>.&#160; If you&rsquo;re a <a href="http://www.tonyrobbins.com/" target="_blank">Tony Robbins</a> aficionado, that might sound family.&#160; In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Awaken-Giant-Within-Anthonny-Robins/dp/B000PGN0HO%3FSubscriptionId%3D0JTCV5ZMHMF7ZYTXGFR2%26tag%3Dhennesssview-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000PGN0HO">Awaken the Giant Within</a> </em>, Robbins admonishes us <a href="http://www.endurancecorner.com/raise_your_standards" target="_blank">to raise our standards</a> about everything.&#160; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, but <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/01/07/the-power-of-less-leo-babauta-zen-habits/" target="_blank">it&rsquo;s very difficult to successfully adopt more than one change at a time</a>.&#160; So let&rsquo;s put a little minimalism on this concept.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>The next time you&rsquo;re faced with any problem, raise your standards.&#160; </strong></p>
<p>The tendency&mdash;the way the entropic universe wants you to handle id&mdash;is to lower your standards.&#160; Got a lot of student loans?&#160; Take a job the government wants you to take in exchange for loan forgiveness. See a law you don&rsquo;t like? Complain to yourself.&#160; Don&rsquo;t like your Congressman?&#160; Deal with it. Someone flips you off?&#160; Flip back and yell. </p>
<p>Those are all examples of lowered standards.&#160; How could you raise your standards for each of these to force a different outcome?&#160; </p>
<p>How about getting a second job to pay off the student loan early?&#160; How about starting a foundation dedicated raising awareness about that law&rsquo;s consequences? How about supporting a worth candidate?&#160;&#160; How about smiling and saying a prayer for the bird flipper?</p>
<p>Do I follow my own advice?&#160; No.&#160; Not all of the time.&#160; I try, but I forget. I&rsquo;m not as diligent as I should be about raising standards and many other things. </p>
<p>One of the reasons I&rsquo;m stating this publicly, though, is to put more pressure on myself to raise my standards.&#160; By posting it here for friends and enemies to see, I will have to be more conscious of the need to lift my own standards whenever I&rsquo;m faced with a problem.</p>
<p>That means every problem, from my emotions to my lawn care.&#160; </p>
<p>Here are three simple questions that help find the higher standard?</p>
<ol>
<li>What do I believe that allowed this situation to develop?</li>
<li>What would I have to do to make this situation the way I want it to be?</li>
<li>What am I willing to stop doing in order to make it the way I want it?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to these questions will show you the path out of any problem and into a high standard for yourself.&#160; It&rsquo;s worked every time I&rsquo;ve tried it, anyway.&#160; I just don&rsquo;t try it often enough. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I would love to hear about your methods for raising your own standards in the comments below. </p>
