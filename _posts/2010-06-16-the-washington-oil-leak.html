<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/obama_fail_tshirt.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;margin-left:0;border-top:0;margin-right:0;border-right:0;" title="obama_fail_tshirt" border="0" alt="obama_fail_tshirt" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/obama_fail_tshirt_thumb.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a> You would think that the basement of the White House was gushing <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-16/bp-gulf-well-gushing-as-much-as-60-000-barrels-a-day-update3-.html" target="_blank">60,000 barrels of oil a day</a>, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&#160; After all, President Obama&rsquo;s entire response to the greatest ecological disaster of modern times has been empower Washington, DC.&#160; </p>
<p>The disasters are in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. President, and in the latest Gallup and Rasmussen polls. </p>
<p>Politicians who worship at the alter of omnipotent government have no answers to problems outside of government.&#160; That&rsquo;s why they fail&mdash;fail themselves, the victims, their parties, and their country. </p>
<p><strong>The slippery slope to a failed presidency is now greased with BP oil.</strong></p>
<p>In the two months&mdash;Two Months&mdash;since the crisis began, the President has thrown a dozen <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/president_party_boy_OWO4d25FxSlnKofFkCkEZJ" target="_blank">social events</a>, played numerous rounds of golf, vacationed, changed&#160; the number one priority of the nation three times, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJH-fLCgdWM" target="_blank">demeaned the office&#160; . . . daily, really</a>. </p>
<p>He took almost two months to even <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN16174261" target="_blank">speak to the company allegedly responsible</a> for the disaster.&#160; </p>
<p>He held a <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/38609.html" target="_blank">glib, pointless, rambling Oval Office address</a> (<em>sans</em> reporters) that lacked courage, vision, and hope.&#160; Worst of all, his make-up seemed to have been applied by an out-of-work mortician.&#160; </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s impotent attempt at a plan?&#160; Uh, more power for Washington. Forced conversion to clean fuels.&#160; Oh, and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65F5KI20100616" target="_blank">more salary dictates</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65F56220100616" target="_blank">Even a heavily Democrat Congress yawned</a>.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the points where the script called for the president to act, as in:</p>
<blockquote><p>POTUS:&#160; <em>Frowning. </em>I will not [<em>pound desk</em>] stand for this [<em>pause, glare into camera</em>] anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At moments I was almost convinced of his sincerity.&#160; And I&rsquo;m his harshest critic.</p>
<p>The bottom line:&#160; In the most serious crisis of his presidency, Barack Obama abandoned the office.&#160; As Democrat consultant Pat Caddell said, &ldquo;No one is in charge.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I&#160; have heard Obama called many names. <em>No one</em> is a new one and likely the most damaging. </p>
