    Way too many snarky comments about the Tea Party members for me to take Mr. Anonymous seriously.

    For instance:

    "They may not read much, but they all know their Ayn Rand."

    Really?  Gee, has Mr. Anonymous even tried reading one-thousand plus pages of an Ayn Rand novel?  Seriously, the only people who have that type of commitment are voracious readers.  I should know, I average about six books a month in my free time and, even then, it took me more than two weeks to work my way through Atlas Shrugged!  His statement is just ridiculous and contradictory.

    Furthermore, the tone of his writing is very condescending and Leftist in tone.  I can't quite put my finger on a particular quote, but I just get that vibe while reading it.

    Anyway, I just stopped by to congratulate you for finally making it in Playboy---and, you didn't even have to prostitute yourself by taking off your shirt!  LOL!

    Cheers

    What do you think of the second to last paragraph in the article?

    "Causing mayhem is not limited to dealing with the press. We&rsquo;ve quietly acquired Service Employees International Union shirts to wear at Tea Party rallies. For big labor, that&rsquo;s like handing out TSA uniforms in Kabul. And at a rally in St. Louis this March, fake SEIU protesters joined the Tea Party protest."

<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/playboy.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="playboy" border="0" alt="playboy" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/playboy_thumb.jpg" width="116" height="116" /></a> The Tea Party phenomenon has been with us for almost a year and a half already. We <em>finally</em> made it to the pages of America&rsquo;s most venerable . . . um,&#160; girly magazine. </p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.playboy.com/articles/rogues-of-k-street" target="_blank">Rogues of K Street</a> </em>is an anonymous Washington insider&rsquo;s view of the most effective and expansive political movement in at least half a century. </p>
<p>While the author may have overstated my contributions to the cause, the expose is important for historical purposes.&#160; These are the observations of a Washington political pro.&#160; This is how Washington views the movement, not how we or our enemies define us.&#160; In that, it is perhaps the most honest portrayal of the movement to date. </p>
<p>Whatever your views of the magazine, <a href="http://www.playboy.com/articles/rogues-of-k-street" target="_blank">this article deserves your eyes and thoughts</a>.&#160; Take a look.&#160; When you make history, every quarter must notice.</p>
