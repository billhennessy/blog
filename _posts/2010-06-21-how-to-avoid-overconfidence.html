<p>Do you worry that conservative grassroots might get overconfident and blow our chance to stop the advance of socialism in America?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do.&nbsp; I am concerned that we keep repeating the same tactics to the same audiences until both the audience and the actors become&nbsp; . . . well, bored.</p>
<p>When I read stories like this one, that <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2010/06/21/gallup-gop-enthusiasm-highest-ever/">GOP sentiment is at an all-time high</a>, I worry that some on our side might decide they can go back to their regularly scheduled programming.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t sit back, folks.</p>
<p>The Block Captain and Liberty Evangelism project is intended to swell our ranks, not get us fired up.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re already fired up.&nbsp; But we need to reach out.</p>
<p>Reach to whom?&nbsp; Well, about twelve percent of us say we&rsquo;ve participated in a tea party-type event in the past year.&nbsp; But <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/june_2010/62_say_politicians_want_government_to_have_more_power_and_money">58 percent want government to be smaller and less expensive</a>.&nbsp; We need to make sure that the 46 percent who want smaller government but who are not tea partyers are registered and ready to vote this year.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to get out and meet people. That doesn&rsquo;t mean reading blogs and talking to other outspoken critics of big government.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s entertainment, not action.&nbsp; Action requires a little bit more of us.&nbsp; All of us.</p>
<p>When was the last time you handed someone a Constitution and said, &ldquo;this is a gift. Please read it and decide for yourself whether we&rsquo;re living into to these documents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who was the last new voter you registered?</p>
<p>When was the last time you asked a friend or loved one to join you in the Liberty Evangelism program?</p>
<p>I can tell you that it&rsquo;s been over a week since I handed out a Constitution (except to new Block Captains), and I haven&rsquo;t handed out a voter registration form in two weeks. I&rsquo;m behind. (And I need to grab more Constitutions fast.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a temptation to wait for big rallies. There&rsquo;s a temptation keep doing the same actions over and over again&mdash;writing on facebook, tweeting pithy comments, calling Claire McCaskill&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Each of these actions is worthy, but they&rsquo;re not enough. In fact, most of those tactics have lost some value because we&rsquo;ve done them so often for so long.&nbsp; I mean, do you really think McCaskill&rsquo;s office is shocked that so many constituents oppose cap and trade?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying stop calling or writing or rallying.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m saying swell our ranks.</p>
<p>Polls tell us more Americans have decided, &ldquo;You know what? I can live my life better than Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi can.&rdquo; Every day our opportunity to create a sea change in history increases. In other words, people have heard and agreed with our message of smaller government, fiscal responsibility, lower taxes, and renewed federalism.</p>
<p><strong>But we will prevail in November only if we convert those frustrated people into passionate voters. </strong></p>
<p>That means we have to engage them, invite them, befriend them, court them, and register them.&nbsp; Then we have to remind them to vote.&nbsp; We should identify those who will take the extra step of engaging and recruiting others.</p>
<p>This is how we grow the base.&nbsp; And we must.</p>
<p>Can you spare two hours this week to talk to the <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2010/06/21/rasmussen-poll-the-end-of-activist-government/">58 percent who want to vote for smaller, cheaper government</a>?</p>
