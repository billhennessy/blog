<p>Existing home sales fell in May.&#160; As of this morning, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/109861/economy-weak-data-look-even-weaker;_ylt=AlbGESOk2DQLMWv14Ldo9gG7YWsA;_ylu=X3oDMTFhMXBwaDJqBHBvcwMzBHNlYwNzcGVjaWFsRmVhdHVyZXMEc2xrA2Vjb25vbXl3ZWFrZA--?mod=bb-budgeting" target="_blank">economists expected a six percent increase</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Economists expect new home sales to be worse than existing home sales.</p>
<p>And economists expected home sales to fall off the table in July and for the remainder of 2010. </p>
<p>But the actual housing market is already worse than economists were thinking. And now over <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704853404575322604214582736.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews" target="_blank">56 percent of economists expect home prices to fall</a> throughout 2010. </p>
<p>And the bad news keeps pouring in.</p>
<p>Europe is going on a spending and borrowing diet &ndash; the sort that tea partyers have advocated for the USA.&#160; But Obama wants to keep on borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending, extorting and bribing.&#160; The contrasting strategies threaten to <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Europes-tough-measures-expose-apf-3001017232.html?x=0&amp;sec=topStories&amp;pos=2&amp;asset=&amp;ccode=" target="_blank">create a rift in the G20</a> at a time when unity is pretty important for economic stability. </p>
<p>Obama wrote a letter to his European counterparts on Friday urging them borrow and spend more.&#160; Apparently, he wants the whole world to crash together. Are his projections so ugly that he&rsquo;s afraid Germany will be bailing out America?&#160; </p>
<p>Cuts in government spending now may cause some short-term pain in the US economy, but continue irrational borrowing will send the US off a cliff into debt slavery. That Obama and his minions no longer bother to argue that point tells me they don&rsquo;t care about the consequences of their policies.&#160; </p>
<p>See the W?&#160; </p>
