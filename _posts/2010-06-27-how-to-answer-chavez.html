  content: It is truely astounding that there has been almost no chatter about this
    in the MSM.  This is a serious thing!  A foreign government has siezed the property
    of an American Business, and our president has said nothing.  It is sad that we
    have chosen such an unaccomplished novice to lead this great nation.  This man
    has lazer focus for everything but the solutions to our pressing issues.

<p>Communist dictator Hugo Chavez has has stolen eleven oil rigs owned by the American company Helmerich and Payne. As Reuters points out, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65N0UM20100624" target="_blank">Chavez has now nationalized oil, telecommunications (including news), power, steel, and banking</a>. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re keeping score, Chavez leads Obama 5-3, as Obama so far has managed to seize only banking, automotive, and healthcare. But <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2010/06/27/obama-insults-americans-again/" target="_blank">Obama has vowed a comeback</a>. </p>
<p>Over the weekend, I had the pleasure of cutting and splitting some oak and hickory with a friend.&#160; His &ldquo;What Would Reagan Do&rdquo; answer to the question of foreign governments seizing American property?</p>
