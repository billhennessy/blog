    Not sure the country is in tune with what is going on -they just passed in Conference a 2000 page regulatory bill that no one will read until it happens; then, they will all holler . ..the country is in a "coma" when it comes to Obama.. .only half of the country see what is happening the other half are Il Duce lovers .. .hard to crack when the press adulates this man every day.

    We have had so many distractions in the country recently that Congress just sits there and passes these flawed bills and we have no choice in their legislation that will affect the country except in November.  Great article and when you see him tell him he has conveniently forgotten us here in Louisiana.

His purpose: to insult, threaten, and cajole the American people from an international stage.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm doing it because I said I was going to do it and I think it's the right thing to do. People should learn that lesson about me because next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step-up because I'm calling their bluff. We'll see how much of that, how much of the political arguments that they're making right now are real and how much of it was just politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This childish behavior reminds me of a very young manager who is unfamiliar with the subtleties of working through others.&#160; We all know the jokes about Second Lieutenants and Ensigns whose troops despise them. Unfit managers become tyrants, stealing the credit, passing the blame, and publicly humiliating instead of leading.</p>
<p>I have worked for such cretins.&#160; They always fail, though they often last longer than expected. Many people will put up with a tyrant a long time before someone stands up. </p>
<p>Standing up is what the tea party movement has been doing since Feburary 27, 2009.&#160; We&rsquo;re the American people the president threatened today from Toronto.&#160; </p>
<p>Remarkably, Obama is threatening to use the trillions of debts he generated to punish Americans.&#160; He spoke in dictatorial terms, like Chavez or Mussolini, warning his countrymen to fear his wrath.</p>
<p>For those who believe Obama has no ill-will for the USA, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2010/06/27/obama_calling_bluff_of_those_complaining_about_debt_he_created.html" target="_blank">let this be your wake-up call</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Getting back to the implied antecedent in &ldquo;I said I was going to do it.&rdquo;&#160; The &ldquo;it&rdquo; is clearly taking on massive government debt. In November, his party could lose control of Congress. So his strategy is clearly to induce economic collapse in 2011, blame it on the &ldquo;bourgeoisie&rdquo; Republicans, and hope the American people will give Obama even more dictatorial power in 2012.&#160; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the game, kids. Do you want a dictator?</p>
