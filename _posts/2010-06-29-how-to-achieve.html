<p>When a family&rsquo;s children are small, the family has such unity of purpose. Mom, Dad, and all the kids climb into the mini-van or the SUV and head to the store. From there, they visit her parents. Then stop at McDonald&rsquo;s on the way home.&nbsp; If one of the older kids is involved in an organized program, the whole family attends.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Achieving_Happiness1.jpg"><img style="display:inline;border:0;" title="Achieving_Happiness[1]" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Achieving_Happiness1_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Achieving_Happiness[1]" width="476" height="319" /></a></p>
<p>At bath time, the younger ones are bathed in batch.&nbsp; Everyone eats together. Bed time comes for all of the kids at once, although older ones might get to read a while before turning out the light.</p>
<p>Young families have unity of purpose.</p>
<p>Then the kids get older.&nbsp; Activities overlap, so the family must divide to accomplish them all. Soon, neither Mom nor Dad can stay and watch Trish&rsquo;s volleyball game, because other kids need to be shuttled from event to event.</p>
<p>Before you know it, Trish is catching rides with the older kids who have their own cars. In a blink, the kids&rsquo; afterschool jobs prevent them from eating dinner as a family. Now, even Grandpa&rsquo;s 70th birthday becomes a hassle to schedule.&nbsp; And, yes, life is so complex the anniversary of a man&rsquo;s birth has to be scheduled around other activities.</p>
<p>This is like any new organization, whether it&rsquo;s a business startup or a grassroots movement.&nbsp; At first, there&rsquo;s such excitement about the next event or milestone or release date that everyone focuses on that.&nbsp; Then teams get larger, and we divide our attentions.&nbsp; Some focus on the next milestone, while others engage in longer term planning. Before long, we have not one but three or four immediate milestones, and we&rsquo;ve divided the labor among specialists.</p>
<p>At this point, we no longer feel the excitement of the startup.&nbsp; We feel like we&rsquo;re in a big corporation with titles and departments.&nbsp; And we notice that we&rsquo;re missing a lot of targets and struggling for ideas.&nbsp; Worst, there&rsquo;s personality conflict and turf battles.&nbsp; Everything is hard work, and nothing feels like an achievement.&nbsp; Everything feels like a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>The way to combat this situation is three-fold:</p>
<p><strong>Know Your Intended Outcome</strong>:&nbsp; Have a single purpose around which everyone rallies, and make sure the whole organization understands why you exist.&nbsp; For example, the first Tea Parties in February 2009 had perfect unity of purpose: Repeal the Pork or Retire.&nbsp; That message was for Congress.&nbsp; The pork was TARP, Stimuli I and II, the massive Budget Plus bill passed to redistribute wealth from us to Obama&rsquo;s largest campaign donors.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why this whole thing came about: government spending and borrowing for things that we never gave government permission to do.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate the Unnecessary</strong>:&nbsp; Many activities should have been temporary but became permanent.&nbsp; Kill all of those.&nbsp; Weekly status meeting that came about because Project Y was behind schedule?&nbsp; Kill it when Project Y ships and fix the reason it was late.&nbsp; (Hint, meetings make projects later.) Is one project two generations behind because resources move to the other projects? Kill the feeder project. No one&rsquo;s interested.&nbsp; Any activity or project that does not directly address the Intended Outcome needs to stop immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Do One Thing at a Time</strong>:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=453264130&amp;sub=false" target="_blank">The human brain cannot multitask</a>. Give it up. Don&rsquo;t ask others to multitask unless you&rsquo;d ask them to be in two places at once.&nbsp; Once you&rsquo;ve eliminated the unnecessary and established a clear, constant reminder of your intended outcome, you should have only one important task before you. Do it.&nbsp; Then do the next.&nbsp; Then one after that.&nbsp; Trying to do two or more things at once will result in two or more crappy pieces of work.</p>
<p>If you feel that you&rsquo;re busier than ever but nothing&rsquo;s getting done, chances are you that you&rsquo;ve taken on too much, lost sight of your intended outcome, and divided your attention among too many things.&nbsp; Stop.&nbsp; Write down that intention, write down a list of everything that&rsquo;s in flight, then cross out every activity except the one that&rsquo;s most important to the intended outcome.&nbsp; You make a new list tomorrow.</p>
