    Wow, if 85% of people who identify with the Tea Party support Blunt, they must have no idea that:

    Blunt whipped 26 Republicans into switching their votes against the TARP/Bank Bailout to get it passed.

    He voted for Cash for Clunkers--twice.

    He voted for a historic expansion medicare.

    He supports federal involvement in local education (No Child Left Behind).

    He supported the historic move to mandate ethanol in our fuel along with "clean energy" subsidies.

    He is also top receiver of PAC donations from the mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in the history of the two government-sponsored companies (1989-2008). (Incumbent Sen. Bob Bennett, came in second, and Bennett served longer than Rep. Roy Blunt!)

    Bluntalong with Senator Obama and Senator Kerry are listed among the top ten recipients of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac donations between 1998-2008 by OpenSecrets.org.

    Connection? Rep. Roy Blunt voted for HR 5140 (the "stimulus"), which increased the loan limits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from $417,000 to $729,750 in high cost areas....

    Are those Tea Party values?

    Missourians do have a choice on August 3rd! Integrity does matter!

  content: Did anyone else hear Jamie Allman on 97.1 this morning call Chuck Purgason
    dangerous?  It was unreal.  Mr. Allman was discussing how Senator Purgason was
    blocking the state hand out to Ford and how he was removed from his committee
    chairmanship.  Mr. Allman ridiculed Senator Purgason by saying tax give aways
    to Ford are indeed good free market capitalism because Ford will get to keep more
    of its money.  What nonsense!!  Chuck Purgason is demonstrating great leadership
    and will expose the phony-baloney RINOs for their crony capitalism in the coming
    days.  We need him in the US Senate to combat the progressive Dems/Repubs.

  content: Actually Mr. Harry, you're a liar. I NEVER called Chuck Purgason "dangerous"
    and never ridiculed him and , in fact, agreed with him in principle regarding
    the need to cut taxes and not focus on tax credit shuffling and hurting small
    businesses. I was wondering whether it's indeed good policy to let EVERYONE hold
    on to more of their money not just Ford. It's all on podcast. Your best bet is
    to avoid embarrassing Chuck Purgason by fabricating statements made by others.

<p>Rasmussen Report has the <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/missouri/election_2010_missouri_senate" target="_blank">latest numbers from the Missouri Senate race</a>. </p>
<p><img style="display:inline;border-width:0;" title="Chuck_Purgason_49[1]" border="0" alt="Chuck_Purgason_49[1]" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chuck_Purgason_491.jpg" width="226" height="240" />&#160; <img style="display:inline;border-width:0;" title="roy_Blunt_rep_27" border="0" alt="roy_Blunt_rep_27" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/roy_Blunt_rep_27.jpg" width="205" height="239" /></p>
<p>The poll does not include any mention of Republican candidate <a href="http://purgasonforsenate.com/" target="_blank">Chuck Purgason</a>. Purgason seems to be enjoying something of a surge. He&rsquo;s doffed his toupee and traded the Bolo tie for a regular one. And Purgason&rsquo;s released a radio commercial in key areas around the state. </p>
<p>Rasmussen finds strong support for <a href="http://royblunt.com/" target="_blank">Roy Blunt</a> among those who consider themselves tea partyers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blunt has the support of 85% of Tea Party members and 50% of those who are not sure. Carnahan gets 61% of the vote from those who are not members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a very large plurality of Missouri voters support the Tea Party movement.</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, 43% of Missouri voters say the Tea Party movement is good for the country, while 27% view it as a bad thing.</p>
<p>Twenty-two percent (22%) of Missouri voters consider themselves members of the Tea Party movement, compared to <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/may_2010/46_say_tea_party_good_for_america_31_disagree">16% nationwide</a>. Fifty-four percent (54%) say they are not members, but 24% aren&rsquo;t sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font>Of the 24 percent who &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t sure&rdquo; whether their members of the tea party movement, I wonder what evidence they need to make up their minds</font></p>
<p>When it comes to the general election, Rasmussen pits Blunt against Secretary of State Robin Carnahan. Blunt leads Carnahan 48 to 43 percent.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Need Primary Poll</strong></p>
<p>It would be nice if a national pollster would check on Blunt vs. Purgason. The last poll of that primary race was in March and Blunt led 48 to 18 percent.&#160; Again, though, Purgason seems to have caught a bit of a tailwind in recent weeks, at least in the St. Louis area. </p>
<p>When we look at issues, it&rsquo;s a stark reminder of Robin Carnahan&rsquo;s hard left liberalism. One example: 81 percent of those who oppose Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law support Robin Carnahan.&#160; </p>
