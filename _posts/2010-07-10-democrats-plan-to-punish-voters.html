    The Republicans in the Senate need to filibuster everything the Dems/Statists will try to pass. That is a way to stop it. Getting the RINO's to go along is the trick. I have been calling for a filibuster of Kagan, but they do not seem to want to, coming up with the lame phrase of elections have consequences. Elections do not give them the right to destroy the country.

<p>Democrats are planning to punish the American people with draconian, destructive legislation during the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704293604575343262629361470.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop" target="_blank">lame duck session following November&rsquo;s election, according the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>That's why there have been signs in recent weeks that party leaders are planning an ambitious, lame-duck session to muscle through bills in December they don't want to defend before November. Retiring or defeated members of Congress would then be able to vote for sweeping legislation without any fear of voter retaliation.</p>

<p>Cowardly bastards.&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, chair of the Senate committee overseeing labor issues, told the Bill Press radio show in June that "to those who think [card check] is dead, I say think again." He told Mr. Press "we're still trying to maneuver" a way to pass some parts of the bill before the next Congress is sworn in.</p>

<p>In other words, these slimy frauds will retaliate against the people of this country by shoving more corruption down our throats. </p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t inspire every American to politically kick the teeth down the throat of the Democratic Party, nothing will. Let&rsquo;s defeat the s.o.b.s so completely they couldn&rsquo;t get elected dog-catcher in a town their family owns.&#160; </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with an enormous turnout on August 3 to send a clear message about ObmaCare by voting <a href="http://www.mohealthfreedom.org/" target="_blank">Yes on Proposition C</a>. </p>
<p>From Labor Day to Election Day, let&rsquo;s flood Missouri and Southern Illinois with the largest grassroots campaign for patriotic candidates in American history.&#160; While we don&rsquo;t have funding from billionaires to hire college kids, we have thousands of dedicated American patriots who will tirelessly.&#160; </p>
<p>Put in for vacation November 1, 2, and 3.&#160; Your country will need you to get out the vote the first and second.&#160; And you&rsquo;ll need to sit back and smile on November 3. </p>
<p>Fight, fight, fight, fight like your children&rsquo;s lives depend on it. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve strangled Pursuit of Happiness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve targeted Liberty. </p>
<p>Can Life be far behind?</p>
