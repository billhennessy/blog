    They want to SILENCE the Masses. There is a lot of pending legislation to cut down on information being distributed. The Net-Neutrality Bill and the Cyber Security Act to name some.Mark Lloyd is working on limiting conservative talk radio.There are groups trying to SILENCE the Tea-Party movement by calling them RACISTS. Look at what they have been doing to the so-called Main-Stream Media, the police told them to leave a public place when some military personnel chained themselves to the WhiteHouse fence and they did. Then they were restricted on the coverage coming from the Gulf. This is something Dictators like Hugo Chavez does (sorry Sean Penn).I guess Obama must of read Chavez's book.That is why the ELECTION in November is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

<p>Claim is <a href="http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/203321.php" target="_blank">it&rsquo;s a law enforcement issue</a>.&#160; But under the Obama Regime, anything seems possible.&#160; Anything at all.</p>
<p>I will spend this weekend backing up and downloading my blogs.&#160; </p>
<p>Who know.&#160; This could revitalize the mimeograph machine. </p>
