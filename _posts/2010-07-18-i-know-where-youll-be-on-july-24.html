<p>You&rsquo;ll be in Grove Park in Grafton, Illinois, for:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/2010/07/17/alton-tea-party-july-24th/" target="_blank">ALTON IL. T.E.A PARTY FIRST ANNIVERSARY</a></p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;1776 FREEDOM RALLY&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Saturday, July 24<sup>th</sup> 4pm-7pm</strong></p>
<p align="left">Think about it.&#160; You&rsquo;ve Fast Eddie&rsquo;s right there. You&rsquo;ve got two of the most haunted towns in America&#160; with Grafton and Alton.&#160; Great history, including homes that were critical to the Underground Railroad.</p>
<p align="left">[<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=main+street+grafton,+il&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Main+St,+Grafton,+Jersey,+Illinois+62037&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=AWZCTPSWCMP88AbA9OjPDw&amp;ved=0CBMQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=38.969286,-90.426965&amp;spn=0.02052,0.038581&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank">Map of Grafton</a>]</p>
<p align="left">In short, you get to help make history in a place where history was made. </p>
<p align="left">I am so honored to return to speak for the second year in a row.&#160; Even better, Dr. Gina Loudon, hostess of the hottest new show on radio, will be there, too.&#160; Not to mention the great people of the Alton Tea Party and 9-12 Project, Veteran Michelle Sharp, and more.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/alton.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0;margin-right:auto;border-right:0;" title="alton" border="0" alt="alton" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/alton_thumb.jpg" width="416" height="313" /></a> </p>
<p align="left">I have to tell you about the <a href="http://www.altonteaparty.com/" target="_blank">Alton Tea Party</a> and 9-12 Project people.&#160; These are the gold standard of <em>get out the vote</em> heroes. By turning on the afterburners, they made history in Madison County at the Illinois primary this year.&#160; How so?</p>
<p align="left">Madison County is typically a 2:1 Democrat vote in primaries.&#160; Not this year.&#160; Because of the ridiculous efforts of those two groups, Madison votes 3:1 Republican.&#160; Not only that, their voters understood First Principles.&#160; The demonstrated that understanding by voting over 40 percent for Adam Andrzjewski, the solid conservative who earned Lech Walesa&rsquo;s endorsement.&#160; That&rsquo;s 40 percent out of field of 6 candidates. </p>
<p align="left">Their efforts will make a difference again in November. Why not make the short drive to Grafton for this event. Then we&rsquo;ll all stop at Fast Eddie&rsquo;s for a cold one.&#160; You might even want to book a room at Pere Marquette State Park or one of the awesome, old hotels in Grafton or Alton. </p>
<p align="left">Please plan to join us at Grove Park in Alton next Saturday, July 24, at 4:00 p.m.&#160; It&rsquo;s been a long 17 months, I know.&#160; But we&rsquo;ve slackened the pace lately.&#160; Now it&rsquo;s time to gear up for Election Season.&#160; And there&rsquo;s no better organizations in the country to kick off elections than the Alton Tea Party and 9-12 Project. </p>
