<p>Between a touch of the flu and the flurry of activity over this very issue, I missed the best, most direct breakdown of Ben Jealous's misguided and&nbsp;hypocritical attack on the Tea Party. &nbsp;Read this <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/op_ed/view.bg?articleid=1267998" target="_blank">column by Michael Graham</a> on BostonHerald.com dated Thursday, July 15.</p>
<p>Money quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you&rsquo;re looking for bigots at a Tea Party rally, they&rsquo;re on the fringe. When you&rsquo;re looking for them at the NAACP, they&rsquo;re on stage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>When we find bigots, even on the fringe, at a St. Louis event, we drive them out. And we don't hide the fact that they were there.</p>
<p>At the April 15 Tea Party in Clayton, MO, <a href="http://sharpelbowsstl.blogspot.com/">Adam Sharp</a> and several others drove from the park a guy wearing Nazi crap. They did it by standing next to him with a sign that read "Fake Tea Partier" while Sharp verbally challenged him. &nbsp;Lee Fang, a "researcher" with American Progress with<a href="http://www.verumserum.com/?p=7649"> a history of shredding the truth</a>, has doctored Sharp's great video (without legal permission). Here's what actually happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the NAACP treated the racists and anti-Semites in their midst the way the Tea Party does, Mr. Jealous wouldn't be so busy <a href="http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/07/breaking-naacp-prez-tries-to-weasel-his-way-out-of-controversial-attack-on-tea-party-patriots/">back-peddling from his hypocritical lies</a> today.</p>
<p>By "racists" and "anti-Semites," I mean Louis Farrakhan, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axu1i_DS6jo&amp;feature=related">Rev.&nbsp;Jeremiah&nbsp;Wright</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm">Jesse Jackson</a>, and Al Sharpton, to name only a few. &nbsp;As Mr. Graham pointed out, "This is the leadership of the NAACP, not some lone kook in a vast crowd."</p>
<p>Now that the President and <a href="http://poedpatriot.blogspot.com/2010/07/biden-tea-parties-not-racist.html" target="_blank">Joe Biden have admitted that the Tea Party is not a racist movement</a>, it seems Mr. Jealous and the NAACP are all alone, twisting in the wind.</p>
<p>Mr. Jealous seemed to want us to admit we're intolerant? &nbsp;We are. &nbsp;We don't tolerate racism. Period.</p>
