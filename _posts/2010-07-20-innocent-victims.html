<p>When the NAACP&rsquo;s Ben Jealous fired a reckless volley at the Tea Party, he missed his marked and struck an innocent woman. </p>
<p>One week ago tonight, the news cycle was alive with the excitement of a heavyweight fight.&#160; The NAACP&rsquo;s Ben Jealous needed to raise money and restore a sagging membership. He decided to pick a fight with the Tea Party.&#160; </p>
<p>On Monday, the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2010/07/11/2076909/naacp-takes-critical-look-at-tea.html" target="_blank">NAACP leaked a resolution to the Kansas City Star</a> that stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The resolution . . . calls upon &ldquo;all people of good will to repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties, and to stand in opposition to<strong> its drive to push our country back to the pre-civil rights era. </strong>[emphasis added]&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By painting as &lsquo;racist&rsquo; the 20 million people who have attended a Tea Party event, the NAACP forced the hand of Tea Party organizers. That response came from the <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/2010/07/13/st-louis-tea-party-condemns-naacp-slur/" target="_blank">St. Louis Tea Party with a resolution</a> condeming the NAACP for lowering itself into the gutter. </p>
<p>The fight continued into the Sunday talk shows.&#160; The NAACP backtracked, softened its resolution, and softened its rhetoric in the wake of criticism.&#160; At times, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39783.html" target="_blank">Ben Jealous even tried to claim</a> he&rsquo;d never said what he&rsquo;d said. </p>
<p>Then on Monday, video emerged of a USDA bureaucrat, Shirley Sherrod, addressing an NAACP meeting. In the video, Sherrod talked about withholding information and assistance from farmer because the farmer was white. The audience approved.&#160; The woman was forced to resign under pressure from the White House. The NAACP denounced Sherrod&rsquo;s blatant racism.</p>
<p>But that was only half the story.</p>
<p>If anyone had bothered to watch the whole tape (over 40 minutes long), they&rsquo;d have learned Sherrod&rsquo;s story was a story of redemption. </p>
<p>Shirley ended up going above and beyond to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/07/20/2010-07-20_shirley_sherrod_exusda_worker_white_house_forced_me_to_resign_over_fabricated_ra.html" target="_blank">help the farmer save his farm</a>.&#160; She got over his whiteness and helped his humanity. Though she tells her story in subtle tones, it is a rich story of transformation. </p>
<p>Starting fights is easy.&#160; I&rsquo;ve done it myself. But the consequences are often far worse than intended. The suffering rarely limits itself to the combatants. There&rsquo;s always collateral damage.&#160; </p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing to come from Ben Jealous&rsquo;s recklessness was&#160; not a discussion of race, which I believe we have too many of. The lesson here is: be very careful before throwing the first stone, because you have no idea who it will strike.</p>
<p>I said nasty things about Shirley Sherrod yesterday online. I hope no one read them, but I know that&rsquo;s a false hope. I am sorry.&#160; I should have waited for all of the facts, but I did not.&#160; Shame on me. </p>
<p>Take an hour and listen.&#160; You may not agree with everything Shirley says. That&rsquo;s okay. But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be able to avoid the conclusion that is a good woman trying to do the Lord&rsquo;s work the best she can with the life she&rsquo;s given. That&rsquo;s about as American as you get.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#160; Or maybe not. Dan Riehl thinks I&rsquo;m being a softy. Is she a <a href="http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2010/07/video-shirley-sherrod-is-a-racist-and-a-marxist.html" target="_blank">Marxist and an unrepentant racist</a>? I&rsquo;ve been too willing to see the best in people before. </p>

<p><a href="http://thedanashow.wordpress.com/2010/07/21/on-shirley-sherrod/" target="_blank">Dana Loesch has more</a>. She points out that Sherrod calls out the NAACP for starting a fight where none was needed. But also points out that the &ldquo;post-racial&rdquo; Obama has intentionally fomented racial mistrust that has fostered this nasty environment.&#160; </p>
<p>Darin Morley: &ldquo;Fifty years ago we were segregated by law. <a href="http://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2010/01/race-american.html" target="_blank">Today, we're segregated by our own choices</a>.&rdquo;</p>
