    Bill -

    Thank for succinctly stating the reality of why racism exhists.  As you said last night at The Wood, this woman has allowed her growth, personal and financial, to be stunted.

    By the way, the singer I was telling you about is Krista Brandt.  Her song "I Am America" is Fantastic!!

  content: Bill, spot On, I have had a difficult time understanding this dilemma.
    The Mainstrean media, has it wrong,,,please look at the proper context and dig
    deep to see and her her real message and the of the Mainstream media. They missed
    the Boat, once again, President BARRY HUSSEIN OBAMA, spoke too soon without the
    facts,,,reminds me of Beergate,,,none too soon ,Regards Scott

<p> To no one&rsquo;s surprise, leftist idiots and hate-mongers like David Frum, Keith Olbermann, and the staff of CNN point their crooked, hostile fingers toward Andrew Breitbart as the cause of Shirley Sherrod&rsquo;s pain. That&rsquo;s like blaming Ron Howard for the problems on board Apollo 13.&#160; </p>
<p>What Breitbart and Big Government did regarding Ms. Sherrod was identical to what every television news program does every day of the week. They produced a news story based on information reasonably available to them.&#160; </p>
<p>Unlike the paid liars and libelists at MediaMatters, ThinkProgress, and MSNBC, Breitbart&rsquo;s journalistic integrity was close to perfect in the Sherrod story.&#160; </p>
<ul>
<li>Facts were correct</li>
<li>Persons were properly identified</li>
<li>Video and words were propoerty attributed</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, the tale of redemption part of the speech was absent from the video Breitbart received.&#160; We all wish he&rsquo;d received the whole video. But he didn&rsquo;t. He honestly believed he had the whole story, and he ran with it.&#160; </p>
<p>The accusations against Breitbart, including those leveled by Shirley Sherrod herself, are shameful and unsubstantiated. They reveal the despair of a dying ideology, not the considered judgment of reasonable men and women.</p>
<p>Andrew Breitbart accurately demonstrated with that video the NAACP&rsquo;s overt racism. That&rsquo;s why Olbermann and Frum are angry: Andrew let us in on the truth.</p>
<p>But Shirley Sherrod was wronged.&#160; She was wronged by Barack Obama, the hyper-racial President who has worked overtime to create racial hostilities. She was wronged by Ben Jealous and the participants of the NAACP&rsquo;s recent convention whose malicious and bigoted lies about Tea Party attendees demanded Breitbart&rsquo;s (and others) search for truth.&#160; She was wronged by the White House staff&rsquo;s paranoid fear of the power of Glenn Beck and Fox News.</p>
<p>Mostly, though Shirley Sherrod was wronged by a lifetime of miseducation. Her entire worldview was formed from a pack of lies&mdash;lies that all of hear every day, but only some of us are lucky enough to see for what they are.</p>
<p>The public schools, the racist faculties of most American universities, the press, the destructive parasites of the Civil Rights Industry conspire to convince good people like Ms. Sherrod that they are incapable of making it on their own. Over her lifetime, Ms. Sherrod has been pummeled with lies that resulted in a contempt for whites from which she&rsquo;s happily extracted herself. But she has not overcome the false teachings that others owe her happiness and money. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pray that Ms. Sherrod will have an epiphany that frees her from hatred of achievement just as she&rsquo;s been liberated from her former contempt for white people. </p>
