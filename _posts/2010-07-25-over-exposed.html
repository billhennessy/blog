  content: What drives me nuts about cases like this is that she knows that Andrew
    made a mistake, he has openly come out and said that his source failed to provide
    him with the full tape. However, Shirley, knowing this comes out and says he's
    a racist! After Andrew has apologized to her a number of times. They make a whole
    scene out of a mistake that has been admitted!

<p>Just before her beatification, Shirley Sherrod jumped the shark. </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Fonziejumptheshark_1247001426.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;" title="Fonzie-jumptheshark_1247001426" border="0" alt="Fonzie-jumptheshark_1247001426" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Fonziejumptheshark_1247001426_thumb.jpg" width="459" height="349" /></a> </p>
<p>On Thursday, CNN&rsquo;s Anderson Cooper let the embattled former USDA director talk for an hour. Bad idea. It was bad for CNN, bad for viewers, and really bad for <a href="http://biggovernment.com/publius/2010/07/23/sherrod-breitbart-wants-blacks-to-be-slaves-again/" target="_blank">Sherrod, who lost her mind</a> on the air. This is what she said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think he&rsquo;d [Andrew Breitbart would] like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery, That&rsquo;s where I think he&rsquo;d like to see all black people end up again. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sad tale gets sadder. </p>
<p>If Anderson Cooper&rsquo;s purpose was to expose Sherrod as a bitter, racial, crank, then he did yeoman&rsquo;s work.&#160; In that one hour special of All Shirley, All The Time, Cooper didn&rsquo;t just knock Sherrod off of her pedestal&mdash;a pedestal <a href="http://biggovernment.com/amarlow/2010/07/25/shirley-silenced-sherrod-kept-out-of-sunday-talk-shows/" target="_blank">I helped place her on</a>&mdash;he hit her in the head with it.&#160; </p>
<p>But the destruction of Shirley Sherrod was not Cooper&rsquo;s intent, I&rsquo;m sure.&#160; He hoped to canonize the woman. It&rsquo;s a comedy of errors all around. Sherrod&rsquo;s media performance was so terrible <a href="http://biggovernment.com/amarlow/2010/07/25/shirley-silenced-sherrod-kept-out-of-sunday-talk-shows/" target="_blank">she was banned form the Sunday talk shows</a>. If we ever hear from her again, it will be after intense media coaching from the best the DNC has to offer.&#160; But no coaching or make-up will cover her seething anger toward everything that doesn&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/Examiner-Opinion-Zone/Shirley-Sherrods-Disappearing-Act-Not-So-Fast-98846149.html" target="_blank">hand her cash</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, Andrew Breitbart&mdash;the man who broke the story&mdash;got it just about right. He said all along that Sherrod hadn&rsquo;t gotten past race.&#160; </p>
<p>Jonah Goldberg said <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzIzN2ExNzJkMDhjNjcwMzdiYWY1Mjg5Y2JlZGUwZjk=" target="_blank">Shirley Sherrod owes Breitbart an apology</a>. I agree. But don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>
