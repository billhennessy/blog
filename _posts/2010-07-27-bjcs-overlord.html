  content: I heard this on The Dana Show today &amp; not surprised.  Welcome to Bureaucratic
    Jammed healthCare.  The atmosphere in the system is oppressive.  Doctors seem
    to be losing the ability to be what they were trained to be.  Care is already
    being driven by 'national' mandates on best practices.  Which in essence tells
    the doctor what to do (translates into what to do to get reimbursement**IMHO).  It's
    crazy.  We as nurses are being forced to make sure the doctors do this.  I could
    go on &amp; on.  I've already gotten wind of some snarky comments from the Adm.
    of my facility about me so I'm afraid to be too open with my views.  Just to put
    a face to this post, I sat next to you at the Cards/Arizona game.

    &ldquo;Nothing changes.  Except that Lipstein and his authoritarian friends in Washington will gain the power to tell you what you may or may not buy with your money.&rdquo;

    Bingo. This isn&rsquo;t about healthcare, anymore than the finance bill&rsquo;s are about finance or the glowbull warming bills are about the climate, or the campaign finance bills are about &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; &ndash; they are all about those in power being able to negate the idea of Individual Rights, and assert their power where your Rights used to be.

    As John Adams noted early on, the royal road to power requires only that you pave over the Property Rights &lsquo;of only a few&rsquo;; he and the Founders knew that Property Rights are the political linchpins to every Right we can ever hope to claim &ndash; or lose. In this snippet, Adams demonstrates his ability to see the future (amazing what principles and a real Education can do for you), in  considering what would happen to a society once it allowed the <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s15.html" rel="nofollow">property rights &lsquo;of some&rsquo;</a>, to be overlooked in favor of &lsquo;the greater good&rsquo;,

    "<i>"...Property is surely a right of mankind as really as liberty. Perhaps, at first, prejudice, habit, shame or fear, principle or religion, would restrain the poor from attacking the rich, and the idle from usurping on the industrious; but the time would not be long before courage and enterprise would come, and pretexts be invented by degrees, to countenance the majority in dividing all the property among them, or at least, in sharing it equally with its present possessors. Debts would be abolished first; taxes laid heavy on the rich, and not at all on the others; and at last a downright equal division of every thing be demanded, and voted. What would be the consequence of this? The idle, the vicious, the intemperate, would rush into the utmost extravagance of debauchery, sell and spend all their share, and then demand a new division of those who purchased from them. The moment the idea is admitted into society, that property is not as sacred as the laws of God, and that there is not a force of law and public justice to protect it, anarchy and tyranny commence. If "Thou shalt not covet," and "Thou shalt not steal," were not commandments of Heaven, they must be made inviolable precepts in every society, before it can be civilized or made free."</i>"

    Vote Yes on Proposition C... to begin with!

    I have been in this man's private office during work. He has several pictures of him with our smiling president and his minions. No one should be suprised that he is pulling for Obamacare and it's ruinious effects on our economy and healthcare.

    Of course he will never be denyed coverage or receive rationed care as will be the case for the rest of the unwashed masses. It begs the question as to how much he was paid by our dear leader to push OBAMACARE

<p> Steven Lipstein is president of BJC Hospitals.&#160; He is part of well-funded, national campaign to deny Missourians the right to NOT purchase something they don&rsquo;t want. </p>
<p>In a preposterous letter to his employees, Lipstein attempts to argue that human beings have no right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to health insurance.&#160; As self-anointed overlord of our spending, Lipstein questions the very foundations of America&rsquo;s guiding philosophy when he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can a citizen decide not to buy health care services, and with that decision, not be required to buy health insurance? The answer is not as straightforward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really, Steven? Because you sell medicine, you deny me the right not to buy it? </p>
<p>He goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, is an individual's choice not to purchase health insurance an issue of "freedom"?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When educated men start to believe that human beings have no right to NOT buy something, despotism lives. </p>
<p>John Dickinson of Pennsylvania explained rights 240 years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kings or parliaments could not <em>give</em> the <em>rights essential to happiness . . . </em>They are not annexed to us by parchments and seals.&#160; They are created in us by the decrees of Providence, which established laws of our nature. They are born with us; exist within us; and cannot be taken from us by any human power, without taking our lives. In short, they are founded on the immutable maxims of reason and justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dickinson perfectly stated the basic belief of the United States.&#160; But let&rsquo;s look quickly at the consequences of Dickinson&rsquo;s words. </p>
<p>If our rights are inherent in our nature as human beings, then they exist independently of any government, any industry, any technology, or any invention.&#160; Adam and Eve after the fall had precisely the same rights as a child born in Barnes Hospital as I type.&#160; Rights cannot be added or subtracted by humans.</p>
<p>If man does not, in 2010, have the right to not own insurance, he never had the right not to own insurance. Again, rights cannot be added or subtracted. </p>
<p>Nor can healthcare be a right. No one can be compel someone else to become a physician. If we are free to choose to be doctors are not, are we not free to choose to visit a doctor or not?&#160; If we are free to be an insurance agent or not, are we not free to not buy an insurance agent&rsquo;s services?</p>
<p>Lipstein makes an argument that we lost our right to not buy insurance because of a law that requires hospitals to render emergency treatment to anyone.&#160; This argument is already invalid since neither Lipstein nor the government has the power to eliminate a right. But his argument is economically invalid, as well.</p>
<p>Barnes will treat the same number of emergency cases regardless of compulsory insurance because they are compelled to do so.&#160; Further, those who cannot afford insurance today will not be able to afford insurance under the new law.&#160; Instead, those who can afford insurance today will pay for the insurance of the indigent.&#160; Nothing changes.&#160; Except that Lipstein and his authoritarian friends in Washington will gain the power to tell you what you may or may not buy with your money. </p>
<p>In the end, his motives are obvious.&#160; Mr. Lipstein would like to use the power of government to force us to buy what he sells.&#160; Well, I ain&rsquo;t buyin&rsquo; it, and neither is John Dickinson, Thomas Jefferson, or the majority of Americans. </p>
<p>If you believe that governments cannot create or destroy rights, then you must vote <a href="http://www.mohealthfreedom.org/" target="_blank">Yes on Proposition C</a>. </p>
