<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/paris_vote.jpg"><img style="display:inline;border-width:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="paris_vote" border="0" alt="paris_vote" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/paris_vote_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a> On Tuesday, Missouri becomes the first state in the union to vote on ObamaCare. If being a Tea Partyer means anything, it means you vote Yes on Prop C on Tuesday.&#160; I urge not to wing it.&#160; </p>
<p>Most elections, I wake up and think &ldquo;it&rsquo;s election day.&rdquo;&#160; Then I take a shower and go to work.&#160; I think about stopping to vote, but I don&rsquo;t want to walk into the office at 9:00.&#160; So I decide to skip out early to vote instead.&#160; Then a big meeting pops up late in the day, and I don&rsquo;t get out until 5:30. Then traffic sucks.&#160; Then I stop to get a loaf of bread and decide I need to run home, drop off the bread, change, and <em>then</em> go vote.&#160; And I do.&#160; But I barely make it, I&rsquo;m in a long line, and I&rsquo;m cursing myself for being so unprepared for such a simple task.&#160; </p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what you can do right now to make yourself a far better voter than me.&#160; Answer these questions for yourself right now. Write down the questions and answers on a sheet of paper.&#160; And keep that paper with you until you&rsquo;ve voted Tuesday, August 3.</p>
<p><strong>Question One:&#160; Do you plan to vote on Tuesday, August 3?</strong></p>
<p>*Yes or no.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Question Two:&#160; What time of day do you plan to vote on August 3?</strong></p>
<p>* Morning, Lunch, Afternoon, Evening?</p>
<p><strong>Question Three:&#160; Where will you be coming from when you vote on August 3?&#160; </strong></p>
<p>* Depends upon time of time, probably, so think about traffic, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Question Four:&#160; What will you be doing immediately before voting?</strong></p>
<p>* This is important. If you&rsquo;re doing something that involves a bunch of kids, for instance, or your dog, what will you do with them while you vote?</p>
<p>Missouri&rsquo;s Secretary of State expects 24 percent turnout statewide.&#160; That&rsquo;s a big jump from the 2008 primaries when only 16 percent voted.&#160; Have your plan in place for voting right now.&#160; Don&rsquo;t let circumstances overcome your chance to vote <a href="http://www.mohealthfreedom.org/" target="_blank">Yes on Proposition C</a> and to decide numerous important primaries.</p>
