<p>I received a couple of phone calls this morning. Maybe because of the primary election in Missouri. Or is the stifling, stale heat of August that drove the calls?&#160; Either way, I believe the calls represent very good news.&#160; </p>

<p>Back in April, I sensed a dip in the burgeoning grassroots movement.&#160; By June 1, my suspicions were confirmed and <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2010/06/01/the-dip/" target="_blank">I blogged about The Dip</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dip is resistance, according to writer <a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/">Steven Pressfield</a>.&#160; If you quit now, no one can criticize you. You won&rsquo;t be embarrassed.&#160; Hell, after the past fifteen months, walking away from grassroots stuff will give you more time than you&rsquo;ve ever imagined.&#160; You can fix up your house, take a long vacation, read that stack of books that you&rsquo;ve assembled but haven&rsquo;t cracked.&#160; You&rsquo;ll be able to learn a new language and grow your own organic vegetables.&#160; Maybe you&rsquo;ll take up knitting or quilting to scrap-booking.</p>

<p>I was hoping that the cooler weather of September and the massive <a href="http://teapartypatriots.org/Recycle/Recycle.aspx" target="_blank">Tea Party in St. Louis on 9-12</a> would pull us out of The Dip.&#160; I still hope that. But we seem to be pulling out already.</p>
<p>Those calls I received today should give you great hope. They came from folks who were very active in 2009, but who wandered back to their own lives in 2010. As I said in my original blog, no one can blame them.&#160; We barely had time to breathe <em>before</em> this tea party thing started.&#160; </p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re back.&#160; The patriots who needed a breather are refreshed and are returning to the battle.&#160; They&rsquo;re tanned, rested, and ready. They&rsquo;re here to soldier on with us, to their energy when ours fades.&#160; They are indispensible, and we should thank them for recharging. </p>
<p>More importantly, they will provide some of the 1,000+ Block Captains and Liberty Evangelists we are calling on now for the largest conservative voter drive in St. Louis history.&#160; From St. Charles to St. Genevieve, we&rsquo;ll channel our energy to overwhelming Congress on November 2. </p>
<p>That will be the peak of our post-Dip surge, the election on November 2. </p>
<p>So if you hear new names in the coming months&mdash;if you recognize old friends from Tea Parties of 2009&mdash;warmly welcome them back. And thank them for bringing us fresh energy. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re climbing the hill to the summit, now, and that&rsquo;s a tough climb.&#160; But it&rsquo;s a climb.&#160; The graph slopes up to the right.&#160; Our ALICE packs are heavy, but our neighbors will help us. </p>
<p>Nothing can stop us now.</p>
<p>We survived The Dip.</p>
