<p>A lot.</p>
<p>Today, Congress gave failing states and cities <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/40842.html">$26 billion in Chinese loans</a>. More failed policies bolstered.</p>
<p>Today, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-10/fed-to-reinvest-principal-on-mortgage-proceeds-into-long-term-treasuries.html">reversed its plan to pay down the debt</a> in order to put off economic downturn until after the election.</p>
<p>Today, the Fed announced that <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0567152a-a49c-11df-8c9f-00144feabdc0.html">our future is bleak</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we learned that the government probably <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/another-revision-q2-gdp-number-jpm-firm-now-estimates-real-economic-performance-was-13-24">overstated 2nd quarter economic growth</a>&mdash;by almost double. (h/t <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2010/08/10/productivity-wholesale-sales-fall-in-latest-reports/">Ed Morrissey</a>)</p>
<p>Today, we learned that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/08/wholesale-sales-declined-in-june-inventories-rose/61229/">inventories increased because people and businesses</a> aren&rsquo;t buying.</p>
<p>Today, we learned that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704164904575421051109791586.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews">productivity fell last quarter</a>, meaning workers are on the job, but there&rsquo;s less for them to do.</p>
<p>If that much can go that bad in just one day, imagine how much more damage will be done by November 2.</p>
<p>And then the Democrats have 60 days to exact revenge on voters for retiring them at the ballot box.</p>
<p>*UPDATE*</p>
<p>But there's something you do about it. &nbsp;Hurry. <a href="http://www.rightklik.net/2010/08/ten-buck-fridays-august-8-13.html" target="_blank">Vote for Ed Martin in the Right Klik Poll</a>. &nbsp;Now.</p>
