<p>Congressional Democrats plan to hold a special session in August to pass yet <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/08/09/days-decide-democrats-roll-dice-education-aid-vote/" target="_blank">another $26 billion bailout for states</a>.&#160; Specifically for states that have create welfare empires they can no longer sustain.</p>
<p>So responsible states now have to pay for irresponsible states at the point of a federal gun.</p>
<p>It looks like the Democrats want to completely bankrupt America before they lose power in January. </p>
<p>Of course, this also gives empty suits like Russ Carnahan an excuse not to debate their opponents, talk to constituents, or hold town halls.&#160; </p>
<p>Idiot Republicans like Bob McConnell of Virginia don&rsquo;t help the matter.&#160; Bob&rsquo;s hand is out, big time.&#160; Virginia has a bloated, expensive education system as <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://pajamasmedia.com/eddriscoll/files/2010/07/Obamacare-Chart-7-28-10.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://pajamasmedia.com/eddriscoll/2010/07/&amp;usg=__Hj4zZcujQFI1ktsdT7K2zuHI1MU=&amp;h=600&amp;w=771&amp;sz=161&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;sig2=Nghi98sFkkiqxecPAeEESw&amp;tbnid=daJ6bmVQt1zcwM:&amp;tbnh=143&amp;tbnw=183&amp;ei=cDxhTNGCGIeglAf56pydCQ&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dobamacare%2Bchart%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D735%26tbs%3Disch:10,200&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=537&amp;vpy=341&amp;dur=452&amp;hovh=198&amp;hovw=255&amp;tx=116&amp;ty=117&amp;oei=cDxhTNGCGIeglAf56pydCQ&amp;esq=1&amp;page=1&amp;ndsp=24&amp;ved=1t:429,r:20,s:0&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=735" target="_blank">complex as ObamaCare</a>, and Virginia wants responsible states to bail them out.</p>
<p>McConnell&rsquo;s all for fiscal responsibility&mdash;right after his state gets some Missouri money.&#160; He told CNN &ldquo;the federal government is running out of money.&rdquo;&#160; WRONG!&#160; The federal government IS out of money.&#160; It&rsquo;s BEEN out of money. It will REMAIN out of money until we STOP BORROWING! </p>
