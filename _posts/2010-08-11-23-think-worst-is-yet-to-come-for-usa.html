<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704901104575423674269169684.html?mod=WSJ_hps_MIDDLETopStories">Wall Street Journal headline</a> is grim:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Grim Voter Mood Turns Grimmer</h3>
<p>Underpinning the gloom: Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the economy has yet to hit bottom, a sharply higher percentage than the 53% who felt that way in January.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow.&nbsp; I think the<a href="http://" target="_self"> barrage of terrible economic news this week</a> has people realizing that you can&rsquo;t borrow your way out of a debt problem.</p>
<p>So far this fiscal year, the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704901104575423601722830706.html">US has paid more in interest on its rapidly rising debt</a> than it&rsquo;s taken in from all corporate taxes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just the service on the debt, people.&nbsp; And interest rates are at all time lows.&nbsp; From the WSJ.com:</p>
<blockquote><p>Years of deficit spending by Washington have led to a mounting national debt. Interest payments so far in fiscal 2010 amount to $185.25 billion; by contrast, corporate taxes collected by the government during the same 10 months were $139.71 billion. Interest payments in July alone were $19.9 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fed and Treasury officials admit they&rsquo;re out of options for dealing with economic crisis.&nbsp; As a nation, we are living paycheck to paycheck.&nbsp; Yet we&rsquo;re STILL maxing out every credit card we can get.</p>
<p>Soon, we won&rsquo;t be able to get more credit cards. Then we&rsquo;re totally screwed.</p>
<p>Barack Obama inherited a bad situation and made it orders of magnitude worse.&nbsp; In July, he and the Democrat Congress spent twice as much as they took in.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t make it up in volume, Nancy.</p>
<p>To be honest, I would hate to be a member of the next Congress.&nbsp; They will face a crisis that few living Americans have ever seen. And it looks like Republicans have a better chance of controlling the House, at least, with each passing headline:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans, meantime, are gaining ground on a number of issues that have traditionally been advantages for Democrats. More Americans now think the GOP would do a better job on the economy&mdash;an advantage the party last held briefly in 2004 but has not enjoyed consistently since the mid-1990s. On one of the Democrats' core issues, Social Security, just 30% now think the party would do a better job than the GOP, compared to 26% who favor the Republicans. That margin was 28 points in 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>No matter how you spin it, business is being stifled by two things: debt and taxes. Obama campaigned on raising both. At least he kept that promise.</p>
<p>Now, will the American voter keep alive the promise of America?&nbsp; We have 83 days to make it happen.</p>
