    Ok Bill, lets say we get rid of Fannie and Freddie. If the government guarantees the loans anyway, like many Republicans want, what changes? Absolutely nothing.

    And if the 30 year mortgage goes away, which was discussed on your favorite network, CNBC, then house prices will plummet like you have never seen. Maybe that is what we need, to start over. But if the IMF comes in and tries to rule our treasury like they want to rule the Eurozone, we will play into the hands of the richest once again.

    I don't know the solution, just that right wingers can be burned just like everyone else if the massive deflation advocated by the IMF prevails. I am not against some cutting, some alignment of prices, and some decline of commodity prices. We are not competitive as a nation and we need that. But if you implement it too fast, like by taking away the 30 year mortgage or by the massive raising of interest rates no government guarantee would cause, then you will have the IMF messing in our business Bill. And you don't want that.

  content: They want to get rid of Fannie &amp; Freddie to be able to destroy any
    evidence that might exist against the Democrats and some Republicans. Anyone that
    got a sweetheart deal loan seem to be politicians so the destruction of Fannie
    &amp; Freddie answers itself, doesn't it??

<p>Remarkable. &nbsp;Is this is a true change in heart, a real wising-up, of one of Congress's biggest Fannie and Freddie supporters? &nbsp;Or is Barney Frank playing some angle here.</p>
<p>Let's hope it's the former. &nbsp;The best thing for America would be an awakening among big government Democrats. Imagine if Frank became a deficit hawk and a Tenther!.</p>
