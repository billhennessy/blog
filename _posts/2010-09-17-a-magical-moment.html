    Hello Bill

    I'm grateful to my boyfriend,he left the radio on your station What a relive it is to hear you. I'm Californian worst I'm Russian immigrant (20 years in a country) American citizen single mother paying 34% taxes and feed up with all what is going on in our country. Never want Obama in power(If I can I torn him down from his tron), my fault never vote before, listening to your show make me register to vote,just did this morning so I can be accounted for November election. Conservatives!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S STICK WITH THAT. I left Russia for my daughter feature back then America it was a land of opportunities, now I'm scared for mine own feature ,what will become of us? No jobs(all go over sea they don't pay taxes into our bucket.) no freedom, no opportunities, it disappear in less the an year. I'm NOT against immigrants.Just want all to be accounted for taxation, pay tax us I and other do. Don't want to support our schools ,hospitals and government programs on my dollar. I'm living from check to check and I do have a salary above average, I'm poor paying for all and all I'm tired and looking to move out of the country ,I just can't support India China and Mexico no more. Love America hope my grand kids will be able to survive here :(

<p>On November 5, 1980, ABC News Nightline was devoted to the aftermath of the election.&#160; Ronald Reagan won 51-41 over incumbent Jimmy Carter.&#160; Republicans took the Senate and picked up 30+ seats in the house.&#160; </p>
<p>The YouTube clip below shows us only the beginning of the program.&#160; But it&rsquo;s a great reminder of what lies ahead for movement conservatives.&#160; Well, what lies ahead IF we continue to focus on moving the conversation toward first principles and away from the class warfare and Balkanization that Democrats love so much. </p>
