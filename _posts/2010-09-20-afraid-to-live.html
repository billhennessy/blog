    If I can insert one between #1 &amp; #2,

<p>Leftist philosophies lead to despotism. Despotism appeals to some people because:</p>
<p>1. They don&rsquo;t have to think.</p>
<p>2. They won&rsquo;t face consequences.</p>
<p>Problems arise when the people who <em>thought</em> they didn&rsquo;t want to think decide to think for themselves.&#160; Traditionally, the despots either kill or incarcerate the thinkers.</p>
<p>Eventually, too many people think, the prisons overflow, and the people kill or incarcerate the despot.</p>
<p>Instead of living through this cycle of violence again, why don&rsquo;t we stop the despot now?</p>
<p>Vote November 2. Vote for a candidate who believes in people, not government. </p>
