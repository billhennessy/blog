    John Taylor Gatto has written a lot of really incisive books and articles on this critically important topic: http://www.lewrockwell.com/gatto/gatto-uhae-7.html

    Hard to believe, but we probably have Prussia to blame!

    Oh I tell you what, it's good to see that quote of Wilson's getting some airplay. I've got some other background to it <a href="http://blogodidact.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and to put it into a bit more of a chilling context, Wilson said that in a speech to a federation of high school teachers.

    Where did our progressive left come from? We raised them in our schools, and that didn't begin with Wilson, he was just the fruit of the first crop.

    Gatto is a good one for more info, also Richard Mitchell, especially his <a href="http://www.sourcetext.com/grammarian/graves-of-academe/index.html" rel="nofollow">'Graves of Academe'</a>.

    "The Tea Party scares the hell out of the ruling class."

    Yep. Mitchell summed up the NEA &amp; other Bright's position with this:
    "In the Country of the blind, the one-eyed man is King... and the two-eyed man is a threat."

    If you have eyes to see with, rest assured there are those out there who see them as bull's-eyes.

<p>For 100 years in America, government, business, and the education establishment built schools and laws about education. The purpose of these government schools and education laws was to produce <a href="http://garr.posterous.com/seth-godin-on-how-schools-teach-kids-to-aim-l" target="_blank">compliant, unimaginative, order-taking automatons</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me?&#160; Here&rsquo;s Woodrow Wilson, educator and president, speaking on the American plan for education:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity in every society, to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tea Party scares the hell out of the ruling class. The NEA, Washington, DC, and Washington University fear the idea of the class of people they programmed to &ldquo;perform specific manual tasks&rdquo; thinking and voting independently. Think unions want workers who think independently and create things of meaning?&#160; Are you kidding me? </p>
<p>We who march, rally, speak, make videos, and vote are the enemy of the ruling class, not a mere alternative.&#160; </p>
<p>We are the people, and we no longer need rulers. And that has <a href="http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/09/it-begins-top-dem-official-calls-tea-party-fckers-video/" target="_blank">the rulers panicked</a>.</p>
<p>November 2 marks the beginning of the end of elitism in America. </p>
