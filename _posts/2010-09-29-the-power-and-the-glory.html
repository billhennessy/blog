    that played him!

<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>"For over a thousand years Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeteers, musicians and strange animals from conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conquerors rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children robed in white stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting."           <br />- Gen. George C. Patton</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2008, the world hailed Barack Obama. Even staunch conservatives voted for him.&#160; I know some. They deluded themselves, of course, but they voted for Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Today, his supporters politely heckled him in a back yard in Ohio. </p>
<p>The Tea Party has effectively seized the Republican Party. Glory is not yet ours.&#160; We need to find 38,000 new voters in the 3rd District alone.&#160; </p>
<p>And even then, glory is fleeting.&#160; Eyes will be on us.&#160; Not just the angry eyes of our enemies, but the hopeful eyes of the unemployed. The praying eyes of the disillusioned. The proud eyes of our believers.</p>
<p>Glory flees regardless of what we do, but we can move from triumph to triumph, seizing new glory and&#160; releasing the old. </p>
<p>We can also squeeze glory and feel it slide between our fingers and float away. That&rsquo;s what Obama did. And Clinton in his first term.&#160; </p>
<p>All glory is fleeting. Letting go leaves your hands free to grab the next triumph.&#160; </p>
<p>Learn to let go and keep your eyes open.&#160; </p>
<p>The next chance to shine is every day between now and November 2.&#160; Come to 4512 Hampton Avenue, Monday through Saturday after 10 am.&#160; </p>
