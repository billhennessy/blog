    This is a very interesting post and observation.  The landscape has indeed shifted into a darker and more hostile place since 2008.  The real impact of the upcoming election is to find out how much power we, the electorate, still have.  NGO's have been set up to regulate without our authority, the government at all levels has ignored our Constitution, global and corporate power brokers have usurped our authority, Congress is more or less a bad joke, academics with no practical experience are imposing ideologies we don't believe in, crises are being manufactured in order to manipulate the public, etc.  It is a very different place in which we find ourselves.  The question remains: Can America survive this?
    I guess we'll see...

<p>While we&rsquo;ve been building the tea party, the world has changed.&#160; Our world has changed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers consume less</li>
<li>Inflation is limited to food, fuel, and gold </li>
<li>Experiences and human connections are more important than possessions and promotions</li>
<li>Debt shifted from people and businesses to government&mdash;which means to all of us</li>
<li>The government took out a $48,000 loan in your name</li>
<li>Both major parties looked bad when we examined them</li>
</ul>
<p>When the 112th Congress convenes, the priorities of February 27, 2009, may be irrelevant.&#160; Be ready. Even if the old questions remain relevant, the context will have changed.&#160; </p>
<p>Read <em>Linchpin</em> by Seth Godin before Congress convenes in January. Understand that the economy is not exactly as it was two years ago when Lehman Brothers fell. It&rsquo;s not. And it won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Conservatism isn&rsquo;t about hanging onto old stuff but hanging on to what&rsquo;s permanent.&#160; Wisdom means letting go of the unnecessary so you&rsquo;re free to latch onto opportunity.&#160; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve asked for a chance to lead.&#160; If we keep working hard, we&rsquo;ll get it.&#160; Be prepared. And don&rsquo;t fool yourself into thinking you already have the answers. They changed all the questions. </p>
