    Bill, thank you for the posting.  To save this country, we must look in our own backyards first before we can change Washington or what is going on in some of our State Capitols.  We must change what is going on in our local schools, communities, cities and counties.

    Currently in St. Louis County we hold 10 Republican State Rep seats; just a few short years ago it was 29!!!

    As much as we think we are involved in our schools, volunteering,seating on district and building committees, fundraising, ptos, etc.....we are so busy we can't see what is happening in our own backyards.  If we close enough we will see the "Washington Elites" working in right in our own communities.

    We can't change Washington until we change our own communities.

<p>Here&rsquo;s a passage from a fine <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ravelstein-Penguin-Great-Books-Century/dp/0141001763" target="_blank">roman a clef</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>[I]f the worst were to happen and a local armed militia were to descend on me and drive me out as a Jewish alien, their offense mainly would be against the Jew, not against the landowner. And in such a case my concern would be for the U.S. Constitution, not for my investment. The rooms, the rocks, the vegetation had no hold on my vital organs. If I were to lose it, I&rsquo;d live elsewhere. But if the Constitution, the legal foundation of it all, were to be destroyed, we would return to the primal chaos</p>
<p>-- Saul Bellow, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravelstein" target="_blank">Ravelstein</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bellow" target="_blank">Saul Bellow</a> and the subject of that wonderful novel, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Bloom" target="_blank">Allen Bloom</a>, are gone.&#160; They these days coming, it seems.&#160; Allen Bloom&rsquo;s 1987 masterpiece, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Closing-American-Mind-Allan-Bloom/dp/0671657151" target="_blank">The Closing of the American Mind</a>,</em> warned the world of the dangers posed by the modern American university. </p>
<p>But did we listen?</p>
<p>In tribute Bellow, a great American writer, and Bloom, a great American philosopher, let&rsquo;s begin the hard work of turning back our descent into &ldquo;primal chaos.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>We have 28 days until the election. </p>
<p>Give <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/" target="_blank">just one hour in the next 28 days</a> toward phone banking, lit dropping, or Constitution distributing. Generations will thank you.</p>
<p>Visit 4512 Hampton Avenue, St. Louis, MO, 63109 to get started.&#160; </p>
<p>Time is running out. </p>
