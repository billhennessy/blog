<p>Someday I&rsquo;ll write more &ndash; much more &ndash; on this.&#160; But it&rsquo;s important to remember what&rsquo;s at stake in America, in the world, this election: beauty.</p>
<p>Totalitarian regimes despise beauty.&#160; They bury it in palaces where the rulers roam, their cancerous eyes raking over someone&rsquo;s masterpiece the way raw sewage pollutes a clear stream after a pipe&rsquo;s failure. </p>
<p>Regimes, in their attempts to hoard beauty, bury it. </p>
<p>In free America (remember it?) high art never made it big because such beauty surrounded everything. Little country churches with their Godly whiteness graced the eye, their choirs the ear, with a love no painting or opera could equal. </p>
<p>But the regime wants beauty controlled, corralled, and collected in government warehouses to be doled out&mdash;distributed&mdash;like&#160; . . . like money. </p>
<p>If freedom dies, beauty hibernates.&#160; </p>
<p>Let freedom ring; let God&rsquo;s light fill the earth.&#160; </p>
<p>Vote November 2.&#160; Vote for yourself. Vote for the people. Vote against the regime. </p>
