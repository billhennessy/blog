<p>Tonight at Victory Center, the phones were packed with volunteers, and it made a difference.&#160; We made over 1,600 calls and canvassers visited over 200 homes.&#160; But it gets better.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/HQCallCenter.png"><img style="display:inline;border-width:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="HQCallCenter" border="0" alt="HQCallCenter" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/HQCallCenter_thumb.png" width="244" height="151" /></a> </p>
<p>Because of the energy and enthusiasm in the room, the quality of the calls was fantastic.&#160; Veteran callers said that the people they spoke to were more engaged and pleasant than on past nights.&#160; That&rsquo;s because success and energy drives enthusiasm, which people respond to even over the phone. </p>
<p><strong>But we&rsquo;re only beginning. </strong></p>
<p>We need to have our phone bank packed 6 days a week.&#160; And that&rsquo;s where you come in. </p>
<p>If you believe that the Tea Party movement is more than just a rally, then we need you to help make difference on election day.&#160; That means getting involved before election day. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/TeaPartyHQ.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;margin:0 0 0 10px;" title="TeaPartyHQ" border="0" alt="TeaPartyHQ" align="right" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/TeaPartyHQ_thumb.jpg" width="228" height="244" /></a> </p>
<p>Over 40,000 people have attended Tea Party events in the St. Louis area since February 27, 2009.&#160; If each of them give just one hour between now and election day, we will be able to claim victory&mdash;in Missouri&rsquo;s 3rd District and across the state.</p>
<p>Moreover, we&rsquo;ll be able to build a permanent, conservative grassroots operation to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>So, please, do this right now.&#160; Mark on a calendar the hour you will come down to the HQ.&#160; Decide whether you want to go door to door, make calls, or take part in a corner lit drop.&#160; (If going door to door, please start before 5:30 pm so you can finish before dark.)&#160; </p>
<p>We are here at 4512 Hampton Avenue Monday through Friday, 10 am to 8 pm, and Saturdays 10am to 3pm.&#160; Those hours will only expand as we approach the most important election of our lifetimes.</p>
<p>Please come down and help us restore the republic, just as pledged to do on the steps of the Arch last year. </p>
