<p>It seems impossible that nearly nineteen months have passed since I met Dana Loesch for the first time.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/10181.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="1018[1]" border="0" alt="1018[1]" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/10181_thumb.jpg" width="130" height="154" /></a> It was on the sidewalk on Leonor K. Sullivan Blvd, 27 February 2010.&#160; Snow flurries drifted and bounced like little kids playing around at a wedding reception.&#160; Two-hundred or so people had already arrived, and Dana brought the cutest little megaphone you&rsquo;ve ever seen.&#160; With that megaphone, we announced the first St. Louis Tea Party, and 20 people standing directly in front of us hear ever word.&#160; (The rest cheered politely, anyway.)</p>
<p>Today, <a href="http://thedanashow.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/big-news/" target="_blank">Dana announced a new step</a> in her meteoric career: <a href="http://bigjournalism.com/dloesch/2010/10/11/allow-me-to-introduce-myself/" target="_blank">Editor-in-Chief at BigJournalism.com</a>. </p>
<p>The rise of Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bigs&rdquo; and the rise of Dana Loesch are good news&mdash;mark that, Great News&mdash;for movement conservatism and for America.&#160; Hell, it&rsquo;s great news for liberty and justice, too.&#160; Mostly, though, it&rsquo;s good new for journalism in America, which has been teetering on the cusp of irrelevancy since Walther Cronkite became a leftist filter of inconvenient facts.&#160; </p>
<p>Dana&rsquo;s brand of fearless reporting now receives greater, and much deserved, amplification. Bretibart has plugged in the amp on a voice that liberals hate and conservative cheer.&#160; But most importantly, Dana&rsquo;s voice grasps the hearts and minds of those who&rsquo;ve felt left out of 21st century&mdash;the tea party people.&#160; </p>
<p>Fox News, Al Gore&rsquo;s Internets, talk radio, and Breitbart&rsquo;s Bigs had already accelerated the demise of Old Journalism.&#160; Adding Dana Loesch to national scene stamps a firm expiration date on canned liberal news. The Grey Lady is dead . . . long live Dana. </p>
