    I am running as a Republican for Missouri State Senate District 22 and it is for two reasons. First, because I love my country and want to do my part as an American citizen to protect and uphold the freedoms afforded to us by the U.S. Constitution. Second, I seek to prevent any adverse legislation that is passed down from Washington and presented to Missouri residents.
    It seems to me that many politicians like their names attached to as many pieces of legislation as possible. I guess it is to make it look like they are doing something. They like to be commended for maintaining our roads.  However that SHOULD BE EXPECTED, because that is why we pay gasoline taxes. I believe we are overregulated and have too many unnecessary and duplicitous laws.  Governments look for ways to make money and generate revenue through taxes, fees, and fines.  For example, they adopt red light traffic cameras, which Ryan McKenna is in favor of, and say it is under the guise of safety.  But speaking as a former police officer, it is really all about the money.
      McKenna did not support putting Prop C on the ballot, but then voted for it in the name of political expediency.  Just like Claire McCaskill did when she voted for Obamacare to get 60 votes, then voted against it when the Senate only needed a simple majority. They want to be on both sides of the issue. I believe as an elected official you should take a stand on a position and be willing to back up that position.
    Now, McKenna denied that he opposed Prop C.  However, in 2007 he co-sponsored SCR 23, which urged the United States Congress to enact the United States Health Insurance Act sponsored by U.S. Representative John Conyers, which was similar to Obamacare and called for a Single Payer System.
    When it comes to jobs, McKenna preferred a sports complex over an iron ore processing plant in Crystal City.  The processing plant is to be built on an old industrial site and would create 1700 permanent jobs, not counting the construction jobs to build it, whereas a sports complex would create just a handful of jobs once it is completed. The difference between McKenna and me is that I prefer to look at the broad picture. The processing plant would be more beneficial to putting more people back to work.
    I base my decisions on two principles: common sense and fairness. I believe people should be able to keep the bulk of their money. My philosophy is to teach and encourage people to be self reliant and less dependent on government. I want less government intrusion into citizens&rsquo; lives. I believe in following the Constitution, limited government, listening to your constituents, actually reading legislation and cutting out needless and duplicitous laws.

    There is much work to be done to get America back on track and it starts with electing common sense conservatives to be representatives for the people.

    Republican Candidate for MO Senate 22

<p>Political candidates want to meet everyone. &ldquo;If people would just meet me,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll realize I&rsquo;m a regular&#160; . . .&rdquo; guy/gal/tea partier/whatever.&#160; This seems a good thing&mdash;willing to stand before the voters and be judged. </p>
<p>Missouri&rsquo;s State Auditor, Susan Montee might want to keep her name, her history, and her record out of the spotlight.&#160;&#160; That&rsquo;s because Susan Montee is about as hard left as you get. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo; just a sample:</p>
<p><strong>Questionable Ethics</strong></p>
<p>Montee shocked an AP reporter by stating she intended to <a href="http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2010/sep/20/montee-denies-releasing-audits-for-political-gain/" target="_blank">&ldquo;front-load&rdquo; audits before the election</a>.&#160; Apparently, Ms. Montee feels political intimidation will help her campaign against Republican Tom Schweich.&#160; But David Lieb, the AP reporter, points out Montee&rsquo;s blatant ethics problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did Montee really line up audits for release in the final few weeks before the election?</p>
<p>No, Montee responded when asked about Friday if the public should expect a burst of audits before the Nov. 2 election in which she faces Republican Tom Schweich.</p>
<p>So why did she suggest she did during the Obama fundraiser?</p>
<p>"Why not?" she responded. "I was just saying I'm trying" to work hard in the job.</p>
<p>"If I could actually control it in the way that could make political sense, I'd look at it," Montee said. "But I can't actually do that."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Loves Obama</strong></p>
<p>Susan Montee was Missouri first state-wide office holder to endorse Barack Obama in 2007. In fact, Montee abandoned Missouri for months campaigning for Obama against Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>Montee also led the <a href="http://www.mogop.org/2010/03/1793/" target="_blank">Obama Truth Squad in Missouri</a>&mdash;a dangerous and corrupt operation in which Democrat law enforcement officers vowed to target Obama&rsquo;s opponents, including private citizens, for speaking out against Obama&rsquo;s plans to &ldquo;fundamentally transform&rdquo; American society. </p>
<p><strong>Cronyism</strong></p>
<p>Montee&rsquo;s relatives were <a href="http://www.mogop.org/2010/03/1793/" target="_blank">awarded two license fee offices</a>.&#160; Has she audited that transaction?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more.&#160; But that&rsquo;s enough for now. </p>
<p>Susan Montee is an entrenched, hard-left liberal who is willing to abuse her office to shut down opposition voices.&#160; That&rsquo;s called tyranny, and that&rsquo;s what the United States was formed to prevent. </p>
<p>While many conservatives supported Allen Icet in the primary, the choice on November 2 is clear to me.&#160; You have a pro-life fiscal conservative in Tom Schweich or the woman who claimed Barack Obama is the best representative of Missouri values.&#160; </p>
<p>Wait . . . that&rsquo;s a not a choice after all.&#160; <a href="http://www.tomschweich.com/" target="_blank">Tom Schweich</a> is the only viable candidate who represents Missouri values. His qualifications for auditor are impeccable.&#160; With billions of stimulus dollars floating around and countless Jay Nixon and Susan Montee cronies to gobble them up, don&rsquo;t you want a solid Republican auditor keeping them in check? </p>
