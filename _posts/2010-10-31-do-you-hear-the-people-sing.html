It's been almost two years since we met. At the time, I had no idea where this was going. Or what I was doing.</p>
<p>I still don't know what I'm doing, but we all know where America is headed.</p>
<p>Beginning Tuesday, because of your passionate, tireless efforts, America is returning to the right course to meet the destiny our founders envisioned.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, your vote, joined with millions of others, will turn the country around. &nbsp;Or at least arrest the dangers drift we've been on.</p>
<p>We will elect national candidates like Ed Martin and Roy Blunt. &nbsp;We'll replace the pro-Obama Auditor with Tom Schweich. &nbsp;And we'll elect countless qualified State legislators like Paul Curtman, Gary Fuhr, Brian Nieves, and others.</p>
<p>Join us Tuesday evening for a watch party and celebration at 4512 Hampton Avenue, just south of Hampton Village. &nbsp;We'll have&nbsp;trolley&nbsp;service to Ed Martin's and Gary Fuhr's celebrations.</p>
<p>Thank you for the most amazing journey of my life. &nbsp;And thank God it's only the beginning.</p>
