<p>Six hundred fourteen days from the first Tea Parties to Election Day.&#160; That&rsquo;s 307 days in 2009 and 307 in 2010.&#160; </p>
<p>In that time, we&rsquo;ve met so many people.&#160; We&rsquo;ve made too many friends. (Psychologists and sociologists and anthropologists believe that a person can manage no more than 150 human relationships, so there is such a thing as too many friends.) Most of us, I&rsquo;m afraid, have seen friendships end, too.&#160; Some ended because of our politics; some for other reasons. </p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve seen stars emerge.&#160; As much as many of us would like to think of ourselves as stars, there are really only&#160; a few: those in the arena.&#160; They&rsquo;re the stars.&#160; We asked for leaders, and we got them.&#160; We asked for people to go to Washington and Jefferson City and Springfield and to there serve us well.</p>
<p>Some stepped forward. </p>
<p>Today we pay tribute to those who took up the challenge.&#160; We cast our votes.&#160; The wise and patient will ignore petty differences with this candidate or that and elect the best candidate who can win.&#160; And we all know what that means. In some places, it means voting for a so a called third party, like Tom Tancredo of Colorado. But in most places, it&rsquo;s usually the Republican.&#160; </p>
<p>Tomorrow night, we&rsquo;ll gather in hotels and Tea Party headquarters and watch the tally.&#160; We&rsquo;ll cheer most races. We&rsquo;ll mourn a few, too.&#160; </p>
<p>In the end, we&rsquo;ll have made the country stronger.&#160; The frayed friendships will, as the passions of election season wane, mend themselves, I think.&#160; We&rsquo;ll realize how much we&rsquo;ve accomplished&mdash;this odd collection of people called &ldquo;The Tea Party.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a strange and stressful 614 days, friends.&#160; Thank you for taking me with you.&#160; </p>
