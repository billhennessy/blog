<p>&ldquo;Winning isn&rsquo;t everything&mdash;it&rsquo;s the <em>only</em> thing.&rdquo;&#160; -- Bud Wilkinson</p>
<p><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;" border="0" src="http://stlouisteaparty.com/wp-content/uploads/frugal/edbillboard.png" width="466" height="117" /></p>
<p>Think you can vote without a plan?&#160; Maybe you can. Or maybe you&rsquo;ll get too busy, traffic will be a mess, the weather will turn bad, or your boss will send you on a wild goose chase at 5:30.&#160; Without a voting plan, there&rsquo;s a chance that Missouri will be stuck with a clown like Russ Carnahan. </p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make a plan. </p>
<p>A New York Times blog post lays out a scenario in which <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/5-reasons-republicans-could-do-even-better-than-expected/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">Republicans outperform even the rosiest</a> forecasts.&#160; But that can only happen if everyone who&rsquo;s energized votes.&#160; So make a plan. You can do in your head and it only takes a moment.&#160; </p>
<p>Just answer these questions.&#160; If you need to, create an appointment for yourself in your appointment calendar or scheduler. </p>
<p>Voting Plan:</p>
<p><strong>What time of day you do you plan to vote?</strong>&#160; Don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;whenever I get a chance.&rdquo; Commit to a time of day and write it down.&#160; Make the appointment.&#160; And consider these questions when choosing:</p>
<p><strong>Where will you be coming from?</strong>&#160; Work? School?&#160; Home?&#160; Day Care? What will traffic be like?&#160; What are the possible barriers?</p>
<p><strong>What will you be doing immediately before voting?</strong>&#160; Don&rsquo;t let anything get in your way. November 2 is no time for casual distractions that prevent you from getting out the door when your planned voting time arrives.</p>
<p><strong>How will you get there?</strong>&#160; Consider traffic at that time of day.&#160; Is this a route you&rsquo;re familiar with?&#160; Know where you&rsquo;ll park.&#160; </p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Who will you bring with you? </strong> We need as many liberty lovers at the polls as possible.&#160; Bring a friend or neighbor, even if it means going to two polling places.&#160; Don&rsquo;t leave our freedom to chance.&#160; </p>
<p>The polls are positive, but the only poll that counts is the one on November 2, and no one will call you.&#160; You need to get out and make liberty happen. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
