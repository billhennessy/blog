<p>The clock is ticking on dozens of Democrat congressional careers. And a band of activists in Missouri are helping the losers move. </p>
<p>Operation &ldquo;Pack Up and Get Out&rdquo; struck the offices of Rep. Russ Carnahan (D-MO) today. Carnahan is struggling to hold off Republican challenger Ed Martin, an original Tea Partier whose campaign has energized Missouri&rsquo;s 3<sup>rd</sup> Congressional District. </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo-2.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;" title="photo (2)" border="0" alt="photo (2)" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo-2_thumb.jpg" width="406" height="530" /></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pack Up and Get Out&rdquo; delivered 300 moving boxes to the Congressman&rsquo;s offices in Brentwood, Missouri. Behind the door, Carnahan&rsquo;s people could be heard panicking. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open the door,&rdquo; one voice said.</p>
<p>Later, a Carnahan staffer named Jeremy denied that Pack Up and Get Out had been there. A St. Louis Tea Party volunteer asked Jeremy, &ldquo;are those boxes from Pac k Up and Get Out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded the staffer.&#160; The words &ldquo;Pack Up Get Out&rdquo; were plainly stamped on each box. </p>
<div style="display:inline;float:none;margin:0;padding:0;" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:1a060b27-e960-4715-b381-8b3babb38b20" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">

<p>Jeremy&rsquo;s obvious lie comes as no surprise. Like the Obama White House and the Pelosi-Reid Congress, Russ Carnahan and his staff have shown a marked disconnect from reality for some time. Carnahan&rsquo;s office <a href="http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/03/stunner-politico-updates-bogus-coffin-threat-story-without-noting-corrections/" target="_blank">falsely accused</a> St. Louis Tea Party of dumping a coffin on the Congressman&rsquo;s front lawn. Carnahan&rsquo;s office let St. Louis media blame the Tea Party for a fire bombing at his campaign office in the summer of 2010. It turned out the <a href="http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/08/breaking-carnahan-admits-staffer-was-behind-office-firebombing/" target="_blank">suspect was a former Carnahan staffer</a> and Democrat activist. Back in 2009, Carnahan unwittingly launched the nationwide town hall protests when his inept and bumbling performance at a healthcare town hall brought loads of laughter from his constituents. Video from the event when viral, and a wave began. </p>
<p>When Congress and the Obama administration crammed healthcare reform down America&rsquo;s throat, that wave became a tsunami&mdash;a tsunami that breaks across the country on November 2.</p>
<p>Millions of tea partiers hope that Carnahan will need those boxes to Pack Up and Get Out--Carnahan and 60 or so other Washington politicians who have abandoned the ideals of liberty and self-government by imposing onerous debts and trifling rules across surface of American society. </p>
<p>The Tea Party message is simple: Pack Up and Get Out. </p>
