    2008 - Lacy Clay's City portion of his CD had a turnout of 73992.  Carnahan's City portion of his CD had a turnout of 77624.  Fast forward to 2010, Lacy Clay's city portion of his CD had a turnout of 41397.  Carnahan, by contrast had a turnout of 46540.  By comparison, CD1 had 56% of the 2008 turnout in 2010 in the city.  CD3 had a full 62% of the 2008 turnout city.  Starting to smell funnier?  It is to me.

    If you assume that the difference are votes which were fraudulently added to Carnahan's total (the difference between CD1 turnouts and CD3 turnouts - 2008 vs. 2010), you get the vast majority of the difference between the candidates Martin and Russ -

    It's a little too easy to figure out.  It's quite brazen, really.  It looks like they didn't need the votes (based on my assumptions, obviously), but they couldn't take the chance.  St. Louis Democrats - I'm reading your mail.  Refine your techniques.  We're on to you.

    Edit:  I forgot to add the margin of fakery as I was adjusting my calculations because of an error.

    Margin of fakery ~3280 votes.

  content: Just like the St.Louis County executive elections last night. Something
    isn't right. Corrigan lead all night and was on track to win. Suddenly votes magically
    appear for Dooley at the very very end. I think an investigation needs to be done.

    Why are the dem controlled districts/precincts always counted last?  Of course we know the answer.

    Same thing happened to Corrigan for County Exec.  Fell asleep with Bill up 3% with only 20% of the vote yet to count, and woke up with him down 4%...statistically impossible.

    This won't stop until the criminals are held accountable and do time for this.

  content: Not only did the city and north country deliver the "votes" for Carnahan
    but also for Dooley, St. Louis County executive, both of whom recceived last hour
    votes when they were behind.  Kudos to Ed Martin for standing up to them, but
    why doesn't the Republican party have the courage to refute the result o these
    two elections?  The Democrats would have also fixed Roy Blunt's election figures,
    but he had such a large margin over Robyn Carnahan, they couldn't find enough
    dead people.

<p>Three precincts in the city of St. Louis delivered 3,800 votes for Carnahan in the last hour of counting.&#160; Wahby&rsquo;s district.&#160; Wahby&rsquo;s wife works for Mayor Francis Slay.&#160; They waited until they knew how many votes they needed, then they manufactured them--typical Dems, in my view.</p>
<p>Now I ask you:&#160; how many dead or non-existent people voted in Wahby&rsquo;s precincts?&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://edmartinforcongress.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a> won, and everyone knows it.&#160; City Democrats have no qualms with committing felonies to steal elections.&#160; And no one seems to care.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In an election when America needed everyone to subdue personal ambition for the greater good, two egomaniacs ran against Ed Martin.&#160; These selfish people put themselves and their egos above the country.&#160; They are not American patriots; they&rsquo;re weasels.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kudos to Ed Martin for having the brass to fight these Democrat crooks.&#160; He will prevail.&#160; America will prevail.&#160; </p>
