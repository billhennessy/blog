    Mr. Hennessy is absolutely right.  For years I privately (among family and friends) ranted and raved about how government (federal, state and local) was dictating how we were to live, and although they agreed with me, the attitude was, "You can't beat city hall."  I kept telling them you could if you followed what your politicians were doing and went to the polls.  The problem was--most people were working constantly to pay bills after their paychecks dwindled because of taxes for social programs.

    In college I saw first-hand how professors molded the thinking of impressionable young people, and if you "played the game" to their satisfaction, you received good grades.  That's why so many college graduates today can hardly read and write, and are so poorly informed as to the history of this country and its political structure.  This is what the elitists take advantage of and why it is to their benefit to keep people ignorant, so that they accept unequivocally what is forced upon them.

    When I first heard of the Tea Party, I was intrigued but didn't really think it would last, but I was elated that they persevered and have become a movement that gives voice to those of us who never thought anyone would ever listen.  Thank you Tea Parry Patriots and all the other Tea Party organizations.

<p>Exit polling tells the story.&#160; About 60 percent of voters agree with the tea party core principles of government constrained by a constitution and government transparency.&#160; Well over half of voters agree with specific measures advanced in the Contract From America, including:</p>
<p>1.&#160; Balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p>2. Elimination of earmarks until the budget is balanced, and then requiring a 2/3 vote.</p>
<p>3.&#160; Audit the entire damn government, including the Fed.</p>
<p>4.&#160; Require super-majorities in both houses of Congress to increase any federal tax or fee.</p>
<p>5.&#160; Require Congress to specifically cite an enumerated power for each provision of legislation.</p>
<p>While it would be easy for the tea party to take credit for this attitude, it would also be untrue.&#160; The tea party didn&rsquo;t mold public opinion; it simply gives the public permission to speak.&#160; On the steps of the Arch in February 2009, at the first St. Louis tea party, countless people thanked me for giving them permission to speak their minds.&#160; As if it were mine to give.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen, the left, the ruling class, the academic and media elite, sneer at we who endeavor to run our own lives.&#160; Katie Couric, queen of the elite, calls us &ldquo;the great unwashed.&rdquo;&#160; The elite worked hard for years&mdash;in schools, in movies, books, and television&mdash;to convince us their our opinions were worse than useless.&#160; They told us that the founding principles of America were not just wrong, but evil.&#160; </p>
<p>While we knew better, we were reluctant to speak up.&#160; The cool kids went along with the elitists.&#160; After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to be elite?&#160; So we bit our tongues and toiled on, hoping that the elitists would tire and leave us alone. </p>
<p>Instead, the elitists became emboldened and tried to &ldquo;fundamentally transform&rdquo; America. That served as a wake-up call to millions.&#160; The tea parties happened. We learned that we were not alone. By the end of the summer of 2009, we learned that most people still believe in our founding principles, specifically that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. </p>
<p>What was left but to assert our beliefs on election day. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s left is not some magical transformation, but a simple, steady application of our power. We build stronger coalitions, we invite more people into our world, and we slowly reclaim the rights and privileges taken away without our consent. That&rsquo;s about as reasonable and mainstream as you can get.</p>
