<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of <a href="http://www.discussionclub.org/index.html" target="_blank">The Discussion Club</a>, listen up. </p>
<p>Since 1955, The Discussion Club has brought to St. Louis the heavyweights of the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Milton Friedman</li>
<li>Dr. Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn</li>
<li>Henry Regner</li>
<li>M. Stanton Evans</li>
<li>Dr. George C. Roche</li>
<li>Dr. Friedrich A. Von Haye (are you freakin&rsquo; kidding me?)</li>
<li>Dr. Russell Kirk (the father of American conservatism)</li>
<li>Arthur Laffer</li>
</ul>
<ul>And that&rsquo;s just the 70s and 80s.&#160; The <a href="http://www.discussionclub.org/pastspeakers8.htm" target="_blank">list of past speakers</a> reads like the history of National Review.&#160; </ul>
<p>On January 13, 2011, I have the distinct and rather frightening opportunity to follow this remarkable list of speakers.&#160; </p>
<p>If <a href="http://www.discussionclub.org/howtoattend8.htm" target="_blank">you&rsquo;d like to attend</a> (and I&rsquo;d like you to), just call <strong>314-416-7722 no later than January 11th.&#160; </strong>(But do it today, just so you don&rsquo;t forget.)&#160; The price is only $37 per person includes a fantastic dinner at the Hilton Frontenac at Lindbergh and Highway 40.&#160; Plan to arrive by 6:30 p.m. for pre-game conversation.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>Believe it or not, I plan to talk about the future of the Tea Party movement in America.&#160; You should be ready to talk, too. It&rsquo;s The Discussion Club, not the Speech Club.&#160; Think of me as the conversation starter, like a gigantic cigarette lighter or a bowl of freshly picked leaves.&#160; Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.discussionclub.org/aboutus8.htm" target="_blank">how the evening progresses</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Discussion Club meets at the Hilton Frontenac. Meetings begin with an informal mixer at 6:30 p.m. that provides an excellent opportunity to make new friends. At 7:00 p.m. dinner is served. Speakers normally speak from about 8:00 p.m. to 8:45 p.m., and then we open the floor for comments and questions. In addition to asking the speaker questions about his/her speech, audience members also comment on earlier questions or comments made by other audience members. After approximately 30 minutes the Q&amp;A period ends and the meeting is officially over, but people often chat for long after that with the speaker and with each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font>I am honored by the invitation, and I would be doubly honored by your presence.&#160; </font></p>
