    BELOW IS OMAHA STEAKS RESPONSE TO MY E-MAIL TO THEM REGARDING PULLING THEIR ADVERTISING FROM GLENN BECK'S SHOW.

    We appreciate your concern regarding our advertising during the Glenn Beck
    show.  Below is a statement from our President, Mr. Bruce Simon.

    The staff writers of our blog responded incorrectly and I want to
    apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  The facts are: we did
    not "pull" our ads from any show.  Our holiday TV advertising contract
    ends on December 19th.  Our contract never specified when our ads would
    air, only that they would air.  Mr. Beck's show is enjoyed by many, and we
    at Omaha Steaks hope our steaks are too.  Our marketing is designed to
    speak to Americans who love steaks and great food, getting together with
    family and friends and giving gifts of great taste - no matter what TV
    shows they watch or what newspapers they read.

    Bruce Simon, President

    Furthermore, Omaha Steaks does not endorse any political affiliations,
    views or beliefs.

    At Omaha Steaks, we greatly value the loyalty and support of our
    customers, fans and followers and thank you for bringing your concerns to
    our attention.

<p>Jim Hoft of <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/12/after-yesterdays-nasty-note-omaha-steaks-now-say-they-didnt-drop-glenn-beck-ads/#comments" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit exposed Omaha Steak&rsquo;s leftism</a> yesterday.&#160; Omaha pulled its ads from Glenn Beck for ideological reasons.&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>We took your comments regarding the Glenn Beck Program to heart. <strong>After further review and careful consideration, we have decided to pull all advertising from Glenn Beck programming effective December 20th</strong>, 2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the president of the company, Bruce Simon, <a href="http://steakbytes.com/2010/12/omaha-steaks-television-advertising-policy/comment-page-1/#comment-2229" target="_blank">tried to deny his political motives</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>If you want to order top quality meats at great prices, you don&rsquo;t have to put money in a lefty&rsquo;s pocket. Instead, order from <a href="http://www.patboonemeats.com/" target="_blank">Pat Boone&rsquo;s AllAmerican Meat company</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.patboonemeats.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display:inline;float:left;" align="left" src="http://www.patboonemeats.com/sites/all/themes/pat_boone/images/pat_boone-all_american_meats.gif" /></a></p>
<p>Pat Boone isn&rsquo;t just a 50s singing star and father of Debbie Boone. He&rsquo;s also <a href="http://www.delish.com/food/recalls-reviews/pat-boones-beef" target="_blank">a Tea Partier</a> and pro-military American.</p>
<p>His company donates 5 percent to alleviate world hunger.&#160; So Pat&rsquo;s not just all-American, pro-Tea Party, and pro-troops, he&rsquo;s a humanitarian!</p>
<p>Support America. Support humanity.&#160; Hit a liberal in the pocketbook.&#160; Buy All-American Meats.</p>
