<p>A man lost in thought is liable to say anything.&#160; Anything at all.&#160; </p>
<p>A guy sitting behind me at a restaurant in Lambert airport began singing along with the background music.&#160; &ldquo;Burning down the house (do do).&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>Perfect. </p>

<p>November 2, American voters burned down the U.S. House.&#160; Before the vote, estimates ranged from 45 to 70 seats switching from Democrats to Republicans. Burning down the house, indeed.&#160; <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/-201279-1.html" target="_blank">The final number was 63</a>.</p>
<p>Among the states, the GOP took control of a majority of state legislatures and governorships.&#160; That means that Republicans will determine (with help from interventionist federal judges) how Congressional districts will look for 2012 and beyond.</p>
<p>While Republican U.S. House and Senate candidates are, on average, slightly more conservative than usual, at the state level, candidates skew even further right.&#160; Moreover, the state candidates tend to be young, intelligent, and determined. And the decline of the Democrat party has some of its state <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/29/democratic-state-lawmakers-switching-parties_n_789571.html" target="_blank">legislators jumping over the GOP</a>.</p>
<p>Combined, this could position GOP conservatives to dominate legislative politics in America for a generation or more. <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/member.aspx?district=105" target="_blank">Paul Curtman</a>, a Marine who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-Uo_uqwCBY" target="_blank">dressed down Senator Claire McCaskill</a> in July 2009 won Missouri&rsquo;s 105th House seat&mdash;a rare feat for a Republican.&#160; Paul is just one of hundreds of highly qualified new faces in government.&#160; </p>
<p>When the Tea Party movement started in February 2009, we said we'd make a difference&mdash;quickly if we could, gradually if we must.&#160; While some of us are more patient than others, it seems we might score both short-term and long-term gains in 2010.&#160; That would be a remarkable gift from the Tea Party to America.&#160; </p>
