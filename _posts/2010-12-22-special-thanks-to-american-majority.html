<p><a href="http://americanmajority.org/" target="_blank">American Majority</a> Action deserves a huge dose of the credit for <a href="http://edmartinforcongress.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a>&rsquo;s tight race for Missouri&rsquo;s 3rd district in 2010.&#160; But their ground help in September and October was only the tip of the iceberg.&#160; </p>
<p>Dana Loesch and I met American Majority back in April.&#160; Ned Ryun, the founder and president, asked us to speak at the group&rsquo;s Post-Party Summit in Kansas City.&#160; The weekend was fabulous, informative, and fun.&#160; That&rsquo;s a winning combination, especially the fun.</p>
<p>Ned kept in touch throughout the summer.&#160; St. Louis Tea Party helped coordinate American Majority training sessions which, in turn, helped spawn tea party and other grassroots organizations around the area, including the <a href="http://southernillinoisteaparty.com/" target="_blank">Southern Illinois Tea Party</a>. </p>

<div style="width:425px;clear:both;font-size:.8em;">Testimonial from American Majority Post-Party Summit in KC</div>
</div>
<p>When election crunch-time arrived, American Majority Action was there. In addition to helping run our office on Hampton, they produced handouts, yard signs, and other materials to help in the campaign&mdash;materials far beyond STLTPC&rsquo;s budget limits.&#160; </p>
<p>Most valuable, though, were AMA&rsquo;s people.&#160; Beka Romm, Raz Shafer, Rachel Hassani, Austin James, and, of course, Ned Ryun are friends, leaders, and tireless workers.&#160; They made Ed&rsquo;s race and the STLTPC their mission and passion.&#160; </p>
<p>Moreover, through AMA&rsquo;s efforts and evangelism, young volunteers from Arkansas and other states poured into St. Louis the last week before the election for the final drive.&#160; They knocked on thousands of doors, talked to thousands of voters, and spurred on the natives to push a little harder.&#160; </p>
<p>In my view, American Majority is the most promising of young, new education and action organizations in the country.&#160; Ned and his crew deserve our thanks. They helped St. Louis, and they continue to advance the cause of liberty.&#160; </p>
<p>Please take a moment to add your name to their <a href="http://newleadersproject.org/" target="_blank">New Leaders project</a>.&#160; And, if you are able, <a href="https://fs18.formsite.com/AmericanMajority/form718509737/secure_index.html" target="_blank">drop a few coins in their bucket</a>.&#160; They do great work. </p>
