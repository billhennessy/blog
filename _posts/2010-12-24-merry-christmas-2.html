<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;" title="The Manger" src="http://michaeldmiller.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/manger-pic1.jpg?w=420&amp;h=622" alt="The Manger" width="294" height="435" />Christmas is the holiday about humility.</p>
<p>The humility of the immortal and all powerful and all knowing stooping to become a mere human being.</p>
<p>The humility of God and king to live among the humblest and poorest--a carpenter's son.</p>
<p>The humility of belonging to a race so broken that our Creator sent his only Son to redeem us.</p>
<p>For me, the humblest part of this season is what I'm doing right now. &nbsp;Flashing through my mind are hundreds of memories of my own rampant lack of humility just from this past year.</p>
<p>Christ's humility--infinitely greater than the combined humility of every human being living and dead--reminds me that the line for heaven will see me at the very end. &nbsp;If at all.</p>
<p>Humility is a tough thing. &nbsp;We earn humility, most of us, with pain and suffering. &nbsp;I get on winning streaks now and then (usually then). It's hard to believe I can do anything wrong during these streaks. &nbsp;That thinking sets me up for great pain. Which is why I'm reluctant to ask that humble Christ-child to teach me humility.</p>
<p>Humility hurts. &nbsp;But, ultimately, we can't live without it.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>
<p>May you have a wonderful Christmas.</p>
