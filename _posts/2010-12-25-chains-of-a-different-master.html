<p>Many people still believe that human beings are chained to corporate masters.&#160; Writers like <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> talk about an awakening in which workers refuse to remain cogs in someone else&rsquo;s machine.&#160; </p>
<p>These well-meaning people (some are well-meaning, anyway) have no problem, though with giving more power to a handful of slave-masters in Washington. They miss the big picture.</p>
<p>Corporate leaders are no longer independent movers.&#160; As we&rsquo;ve seen acutely in the past two years, corporate <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2010/10/06/obamacare-waivers-torquemada-sebelius-spares-mcdonalds-unions/" target="_blank">CEOs grovel before the throne of government</a>, begging and pleading for scraps from Washington&rsquo;s table. </p>
<p>The whole idea of earmarks is part of this game.&#160; Senators tax (or borrow) billions which they earmark for, say, a university in their state.&#160; The university donates up to 80 percent of that earmark back to Senator X&rsquo;s campaign.&#160; Or the CEO of Goldman Sachs becomes Secretary of the Treasury and funnels US bonds through Goldman Sachs.&#160; </p>
