<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/arguing.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;" title="arguing" border="0" alt="arguing" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/arguing_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="184" /></a>Yes, I read that.&#160; And I saw that.&#160; And somebody told me about that, too.</p>
<p>I see the ridiculous charges leveled by ignorant bigots against the Tea Party. I hear the slander on MSNBC and CNN.&#160; I know that Ben Jealous and Nancy Pelosi live on lies about you and me the way vampires live on human blood.</p>
<p>I get it. </p>
<p>My immediate urge when I read or hear this nonsense is anger.&#160; I want to sit down and tap out an angry, hurtful response.&#160; And I did a lot of that for two years.&#160; </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what those conversations might look like to the <a href="http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2010G.html" target="_blank">59 percent of voters who didn&rsquo;t vote</a> in 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tea Partiers are racists!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we&rsquo;re not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you are.&#160; and you&rsquo;re divisive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we&rsquo;re not.&#160; You are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we&rsquo;re not.&#160; You are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. And you&rsquo;re stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are, but what am I?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or we could do something else. </p>
<p>We could push an agenda of life, liberty, and (especially) the pursuit of happiness. </p>
<p>We could point out that we don&rsquo;t hate the U.S. Government.&#160; We just don&rsquo;t trust the people who run it.&#160; It doesn&rsquo;t really matter who those people are. Temptation knows no rank.&#160; We have given that government enough power and authority through legitimate means that sometimes people in government take even more power and authority through illegitimate means.&#160; </p>
<p>And we could go further.&#160; We could put forth positive ideas that improve people&rsquo;s lives. For instance, we could replace the failed and corrupt Department of Education and the failed and corrupt school districts with small, community based schools that actually educate kids. </p>
<p>We could help struggling, unemployed people start their own businesses that will someday employ more people rather than borrowing money from China to pay our best people to sit idle. </p>
<p>Over the next year, we can develop specific policy proposals to make people freer, happier, and better off than they are now.&#160; We can show the world how freedom and thrift and industriousness can solve the problems that vex America&rsquo;s cities and towns.&#160; </p>
<p>In the next year, we can commit to doing something else.&#160; Instead of screaming back at the idiots and liars, we can pursue happiness for ourselves and our communities.&#160; We can make federal programs obsolete. </p>
<p>To do this, though, we have to divert some of our energy and time away from arguing with the idiots. We have let the people see who&rsquo;s lying and who&rsquo;s telling the truth. </p>
<p>Christ said that <a href="http://bible.cc/john/13-35.htm" target="_blank">they will know us by our love</a>.&#160; </p>
