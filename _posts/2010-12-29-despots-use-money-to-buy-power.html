<p>Did you see how states behaved last summer? The &ldquo;<a href="http://www.missourieducationwatchdog.com/2010/08/race-to-top-is-renamed-to-vision-for.html" target="_blank">Race to the Top</a>&rdquo; is all you need to know about the relationship between government money, power, and degradation. </p>
<p>The Race to the Top education initiative dangled cash in front of states.&#160; Most states, including Missouri, bit.&#160; They competed against each other for the privilege of surrendering their sovereignty over education to a DoE overlord.</p>
<p>The fiasco reminded me of a submarine patrol.&#160; We got underway a day early&mdash;before our Sea Store cigarettes arrived.&#160; About half the crew smoked.&#160; About ten percent brought their own brands, not available through Sea Stores at $3.00 a carton.&#160; </p>
<p>Cigarettes became very valuable. Those with cigarettes sometimes degraded those who craved cigarettes.&#160; I once saw my Chief Petty Officer perched on a chair barking like a dog for a Benson &amp; Hedges 100.&#160; </p>
<p>Secretaries of US Government departments like seeing the states beg and degrade themselves, too.&#160; The states that demonstrated the most pathetic, degrading, obsequious groveling got the money.&#160; Obama got their school districts. </p>
