    In general, more attention could be directed to result-oriented action. Public support for the Tea Party is large, but the public has been a bit distracted by the left&rsquo;s antics. While they seem to have a grip on government (note the remarkable progress unions made even during the Bush admin.), most Tea Party gains so far have been symbolic, and many of us (specifically I) have been more engaged in education and dialogue than action. It&rsquo;s a start though&hellip;

    Actively promote legislation that returns authority to states and limits the expansion of federal government. Downsize DC is a good source on a national scale. They inform on specific bills in Congress and provide a convenient form for participants to reach their representatives directly, at pivotal times. Investigate and sign up for their emails if this appeals to you. There must be other sources people can recommend, too.

    Promote the idea of free market capitalism and address crony capitalism and corruption. The centralization of corporate-government power is killing capitalism &ndash; not just in the market, but in the minds of the public. Fascism is just as perilous to liberty as socialism. As of February 2010, six banks own 63% of US GDP. That&rsquo;s scary. Neither Dems nor Repubs have the incentive to address this issue. It requires a long-term perspective and many politicians have an attention span that stretches from 2 to 6 years max.

    Didn&rsquo;t intend to dominate the comment section, but thanks for the opportunity.

<p>The year that ends tonight didn&rsquo;t begin a year a go tomorrow.&#160; Nor does it have a number.&#160; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure when this year started or what to call it.&#160; And, as surprising as it may sound, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll miss it. </p>
<p>Call it the year of the tea party.&#160; It lasted 22 months.</p>
<p>We accomplished only two things, really, in this massive human wave.&#160; </p>
<p>1.&#160; We reminded ourselves that we, the people, can still roar.</p>
<p>2.&#160;&#160; We may have aborted the rebirth of international socialism.</p>
<p>Our work isn&rsquo;t over, but at midnight we cross a threshold.&#160; The Tea Party movement leaves childhood.&#160; As an organization, we&rsquo;re young adults. The world becomes less forgiving.&#160; </p>
<p>Movements don&rsquo;t think or decide. The folks who people them do.&#160; If we try to continue the tactics and antics of this year, we&rsquo;ll arrest our own development.&#160; </p>
<p>If, however, we keep a narrow focus while maturing our methods and broadening our knowledge, we&rsquo;ll continue to grow. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long, very long, year.&#160; But there&rsquo;s ages left to go. </p>
