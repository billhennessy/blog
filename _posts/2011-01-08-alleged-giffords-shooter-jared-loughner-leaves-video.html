  content: "Ummm. . . \n\n<blockquote>\"Most cruel joke of all, however, has been
    played by Hitler &amp; Co. on those German capitalists and small businessmen who
    once backed National Socialism as a means of saving Germany's bourgeois economic
    structure from radicalism. The Nazi credo that the individual belongs to the state
    also applies to business. Some businesses have been confiscated outright, on other
    what amounts to a capital tax has been levied. Profits have been strictly controlled.
    Some idea of the increasing Governmental control and interference in business
    could be deduced from the fact that 80% of all building and 50% of all industrial
    orders in Germany originated last year with the Government. Hard-pressed for food-
    stuffs as well as funds, the Nazi regime has taken over large estates and in many
    instances collectivized agriculture, a procedure fundamentally similar to Russian
    Communism.\"\n\n(Source: Time Magazine; Jaunuary 2, 1939.)</blockquote>\n\nNow
    THAT sounds like 21st century American conservatism to me. \n\nHow do you define
    \"excessive?\"  What is the appropriate amount of nationalism?  What do you mean
    by \"family values?\"  By listing policies and announcing \"check,\" you might
    impress a professor who's predisposed to your views, but you're not actually saying
    anything.  What's the yardstick?  How similar are my positions on that yardstick
    to the 3rd Reich's.  How many planks in the DNC's platform would fit nicely within
    Nazi Germany's?  How many actions of Barack Obama's perfectly reflect Germany's
    industrial policy highlighted int he quote above?\n\nFinally, you are correct
    on your definition of classical liberalism. But I think Knighthawk was using the
    term \"classical\" casually, as in \"that goal was classic Gretzky.\"  "

  content: I find it interesting that many (most?) pepole keep their guns in their
    bedrooms, it fits right in with the sexual fear morals of the US.  Though I do
    know someone who scared an intruder away with his shotgun (didn't shoot it), and
    the police ended up catching the thief because the homeowner had called the cops
    right away (and the thief had an apartment full of stolen stuff).  So there is
    something real that keeps reinforcing the idea that it's best to have a gun next
    to/under your bed for protection, the fear and security issue.  I completely agree
    with your take on guns in your article Eric, and have always had an aversion to
    guns.  It seems one of the narratives that the gun thing also relates to is the
    cowboy psyche that persists in our country, some false sense of freedom as well
    as power ?   Your descriptions of the centaurs in this article really opened up
    a new vision of them for me, and how it applies to my own chart.  My Nessus 4-49
    is conjunct my nn 3-30, gemini 11th, opp my moon 4-14 sag., I am in love with
    astrology, but not very adept, so I was hoping you might clarify something for
    me.  Is it the black moon lilith in his chart that makes the moon/sn conjunction
    so dark towards women?  I have a lot of thoughts about how the sn/moon conj works
    in my life, but was just wondering what this pairing would like without lilith
    there?  And how it would change his chart.  -beth

    also applies to business. Some businesses have been confiscated outright, on other
    what amounts to a capital tax has been levied. Profits have been strictly controlled.
    Some idea of the increasing Governmental control and interference in business
    could be deduced from the fact that 80% of all building and 50% of all industrial
    orders in Germany originated last year with the Government. Hard-pressed for food-
    stuffs as well as funds, the Nazi regime has taken over large estates and in many
    instances collectivized agriculture, a procedure fundamentally similar to Russian
    Communism.\"\n\n(Source: Time Magazine; Jaunuary 2, 1939.)</blockquote>\n\nNow
    THAT sounds like 21st century American conservatism to me. \n\nHow do you define
    \"excessive?\"  What is the appropriate amount of nationalism?  What do you mean
    by \"family values?\"  By listing policies and announcing \"check,\" you might
    impress a professor who's predisposed to your views, but you're not actually saying
    anything.  What's the yardstick?  How similar are my positions on that yardstick
    to the 3rd Reich's.  How many planks in the DNC's platform would fit nicely within
    Nazi Germany's?  How many actions of Barack Obama's perfectly reflect Germany's
    industrial policy highlighted int he quote above?\n\nFinally, you are correct
    on your definition of classical liberalism. But I think Knighthawk was using the
    term \"classical\" casually, as in \"that goal was classic Gretzky.\"  "

<p>Update:&#160; <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> has <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/shooter-jarod-laughner/" target="_blank">much more on the alleged shooter.</a></p>
<p>These appear to be the paranoid ramblings of the man in custody for shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others, <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/federal-judge-john-roll-among-victims-in-arizona-congresswoman-shooting/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+abovethelaw+(Above+the+Law)&amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher" target="_blank">including a federal judge</a>, in Tucson, AZ.&#160; Lots of hard left references in his favorite books, including <em>Mein Kampf</em> and <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>. Politico&rsquo;s Ben Smith calls <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0111/Alleged_shooter_left_social_media_hints.html" target="_blank">Laughner&rsquo;s writings &ldquo;socialist</a>.&rdquo;&#160; </p>

<p>This stuff is beyond me.&#160; Fodder for the criminal psychologists.&#160; </p>
<p>Sick. </p>
<p><strike>Note:&#160; Correct last name is &ldquo;Laughner&rdquo; not &ldquo;Loughner&rdquo; as I originally posted.&#160; Sorry.&#160; His first name has appears as both Jerod and Jarod.&#160; This should settle out shortly as we learn more.</strike></p>
<p>AND we&rsquo;re back to Loughner.&#160; (I should have trusted his own <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jared-lee-loughner-2011-1" target="_blank">Myspace page</a> which has since been removed.)</p>
<p>UPDATES:</p>
<p>1.&#160; A woman claiming to be a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/woman-who-says-she-went-to-school-with-alleged-shooter-says-he-met-giffords-in-2007-2011-1" target="_blank">classmate of Jarod Lee Loughner&rsquo;s</a> describes the alleged murderer as a &ldquo;leftist&rdquo; &ldquo;anti-flag&rdquo; </p>
