  content: Perfectly predicable.  The left can accuse and defame ALL DAY LONG, but
    let one conservative point out the cowardly slander, and the other leftists cry
    foul.

    Tea Party as perpetrating this crime.  The fact that they relish in others' misery
    says all we really need to know about their ilk.  To add to the insanity of this
    tragedy, now the conservatives have to defend their honor - once again - amidst
    all the mudslinging of the Left.

    out from under your rocks.  Ever since Obama was elected along with the rest of
    his Socialist buddies, we have to listen to the crap that comes out of pie holes
    like yours.   It's like when the lights go out and the roaches start crawling.  America
    is in a dark time and here come the roaches like you.

<p>The tragedy in Tucson exposed America&rsquo;s leading leftists for what they are.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AndrewBreitbart" target="_blank">Andrew Breitbart</a> points out on Twitter that his cowardly leftist accusors, including Markos Moulitsas and Eric Boehlert, quieted down on their libelous attacks on Breitbart, Palin, Bush, and Tea Party.&#160; </p>
<p>These leftist cowards shut up only after it became undeniably clear that the evil bastard who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others is not a tea partier, but a deranged socialist.&#160; Whatever Jarod Lee Loughner&rsquo;s politics are, they seem a lot closer to Moulitsas and Boelhert and Chris Matthews and Matt Yglesias than to Breitbart or me. </p>
<p>Am I saying that those leftist cowards are responsible for the horror in Tucson?&#160; No.&#160; I&rsquo;m saying they are cowards who use murder and misery to advance their collectivist politics by libelously blaming those who stand for liberty.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://bigjournalism.com/abreitbart/2011/01/08/on-the-tragedy-of-azrep-giffords-shooting/" target="_blank">Breitbart has more about journalism&rsquo;s disgraceful behavior</a> on Big Journalism. <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> on the <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/shooter-jarod-laughner/" target="_blank">shooter Jared Lee Loughner (not a tea partier)</a>.

<p>Please feel free to post your feelings about these leftist cowardly bastards right here. </p>
