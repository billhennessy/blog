  content: "That militia last year was called right wing, but the media ignored the
    fact that the only party registration was in the group was Democrat.  \n\nThe
    media refers to Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist as right wing.  He is a registered
    Democrat, has run for office I believe 5 times on the Dem ticket, and is an Al
    Gore supporter. He also provided Gore office space during his campaign for president."

  content: I am so sick of this BS, when the muslims tried to blow up the airport
    in new jersey, did everyone and their brother, sister, have a statement about
    it? what about when the muslim shot and killed 13 people at the army base in colorado?
    the throwup media hardly belched about it. now some satanic nut/ anarchist/ whatever
    shoots people and all these people come out of the woodwork, and have a damn statement
    about it, and immediatley blame the tea party, the conservatives, and everyone
    elso they disagree with, its disqusting. Yes its tragic what happened, but so
    is all the other tragic events that have happened that the media/ libs cant use
    to against people they disagree with.

<p>The most often repeated story is not the reluctant hero or the hero who wants to get home.&#160; Nor is it about a mother&rsquo;s love. </p>
<p>The ultimate archetypical story line is:&#160; </p>
<p>LIBERAL PRESS ERRONEOUSLY BLAMES TEA PARTY FOR LEFTIST CRIMES</p>
<p>As <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2011/01/08/alleged-giffords-shooter-jared-loughner-leaves-video/" target="_blank">Jarod Lee Loughner&rsquo;s political bent</a> emerges, we see the same, predictable story playing out:</p>
<ol>
<li>A horrific crime takes place.</li>
<li>Leftist bloggers like Markos Moulitsas blame conservatives.</li>
<li>CNN, New York Times, Washinton Post, etc., repeat the libelous allegations.</li>
<li>Fact emerge proving Markos, CNN, etc., a bunch of cowardly liars.</li>
<li>Liberals erase their libelous stories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few more examples of liberal media lies just from the past two years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember the <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/08/vandal-who-firebombed-carnahans-office-identified-hes-a-dem-operative-disgruntled-employee/" target="_blank">Carnahan Campaign office &ldquo;fire bombing</a>&rdquo; blamed on Tea Party? Turns out the suspect was a former Carnahan campaign staffer.</li>
<li>Remember the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/discovery-channel-hostage-taker-demands-2010-9" target="_blank">Discovery Channel Hostage Taker</a> whom the media called a Tea Partier?&#160; Turns out he was an Al Gore, left-wing, maggot-infested, environmentalist wacko. </li>
<li>Remember the Denver <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/politics/20548292/detail.html" target="_blank">Democratic HQ vandalism blamed on Tea Partiers</a>?&#160; Turns out it was Democratic party employees. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you can think of more similar cases, please post them in the comments.&#160; </p>
