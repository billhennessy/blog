<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that five people died, including a wonderful nine-year-old girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that a dozen or more people were shot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that a deranged man attacked our American system.</p>
<p>But America&rsquo;s liberal elite turned the tragedy into a national day of shame.&nbsp; They accomplished this by callously and capriciously blaming innocent political opponents for the violence.&nbsp; When confronted with facts to the contrary, liberals, including <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/disgrace-krugman-blames-gop-for-attempted-assassination-today-before-we-found-out-hes-a-leftwinger/" target="_blank">Paul Krugman</a>, CBS News, the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Jane Fonda, Sheriff <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/pima-county-az-sheriff-clarence-dupnik-blames-az-political-culture-for-shooting-video/" target="_blank">Dupnick of Pima County Arizona</a>, and others, continued to lie, slander, and libel the tea party, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, and conservatives in general.</p>
<p><strong>Liberalism is at war with the American system. </strong></p>
<p>On New Year&rsquo;s Even, liberal icon Frances <a href="http://www.newsrealblog.com/2011/01/05/marxist-frances-fox-piven-calls-for-a-violent-uprising-against-the-american-system/" target="_blank">Fox-Piven called for a violent overthrow</a> of the American system.&nbsp; Liberals attacked anyone who criticized Fox-Piven&rsquo;s hatred.</p>
<p>On December 17, Missouri Democrat <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/12/claire-mccaskill-promotes-violence-if-dems-dont-get-their-historic-tax-hikes-it-really-is-time-for-americans-to-take-up-pitchforks-video/" target="_blank">Claire McCaskill called for violence</a> if Congress extended the Bush tax cuts.&nbsp; Gabrielle Giffords, the target of Jared Loughner&rsquo;s murderous rampage, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/12/17/house-roll-call-bill-to-extend-tax-cuts/" target="_blank">voted to extend those tax cuts</a>.</p>
<p>There is no CNN special investigaing McCaskill&rsquo;s hateful call for violence. Why not?</p>
<p>Why are liberals allowed to encourage murder while conservatives are vilified even for pointing out liberal hate? Where are the calls for McCaskill&rsquo;s resignation?&nbsp; As PO&rsquo;ed Patriot points out, the <a href="http://www.poedpatriot.com/2011/01/tragic-arizona-shooting-used-as-weapon.html" target="_blank">leftist media use tragedy as a weapon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a shameful day in America. </strong></p>
