  content: "Nice try, but fabricating information doesn&rsquo;t make it true. The
    birthers try the same lame thing and they NEVER get it right. First, a hacker
    would have to break into a secure website. That&rsquo;s illegal, and should be
    reported to the AZ Attorney General. But the screen cap isn&rsquo;t even authentic.
    The Photoshop &ldquo;genius&rdquo; should have tried a little harder to match
    font colors. The actual font color throughout the webpage is websafe color #666666.
    The color of the faked information is #6c7a7b. The URL suffix is suspect and according
    to the Pima County Recorders webpage, &ldquo;where to vote&rdquo; (http://www.recorder.pima.gov/public/voter_info.aspx),
    the address on the faked webpage doesn&rsquo;t exist. Thanks for wasting my time.

<p>Democrats&mdash;from Jane Fonda to Senator Bob Brady of Pennsylvania&mdash;are pushing to ban words, phrases, and images they don&rsquo;t like, as <a href="http://www.poedpatriot.com/2011/01/attack-on-free-speech-begins-democrat.html" target="_blank">P/Od Patriot points out</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Yes, we are living in very dangerous times.&#160; And the danger comes almost exclusively from the left.</p>
<ul>
<li>Democrat <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/12/claire-mccaskill-promotes-violence-if-dems-dont-get-their-historic-tax-hikes-it-really-is-time-for-americans-to-take-up-pitchforks-video/" target="_blank">McCaskill calls for Americans to take up arms</a> if Democrat tax increase fails.&#160; (It did. And Gabrielle Giffords helped it fail.)</li>
<li>Democrat <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/06/biden-says-hell-strangle-republicans/" target="_blank">Joe Biden threatened to strangle Republicans</a> if they didn&rsquo;t accede to his wishes. </li>
<li>Democrat <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/frances-fox-piven-rings-in-the-new-year-by-calling-for-violent-revolution/" target="_blank">Frances Fox Piven called for a violent overthrow</a> of the US systems.</li>
<li>Democrats . . . love to <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/JohnHawkins/2010/03/30/violent_liberal_hate_rhetoric_fifteen_quotes/page/full/" target="_blank">call for violence against Americans</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The White House clearly was prepared for this.&#160; They cared not who was the victim or the perp. They simply needed a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/08/report-obama-administration-plans-create-internet-id-americans/" target="_blank">crime to justify their assault on the first two amendments</a> to the Constitution. </p>
<p>Brooks Bayne <a href="http://thegraph.com/2011/01/leftists-take-to-twitter-to-blamethreaten-beck-palin-and-tea-party-for-az-shooting/" target="_blank">points out the filth of the left</a>. Even Orwell&rsquo;s pigs showed more decency and character than these modern liberals. </p>
