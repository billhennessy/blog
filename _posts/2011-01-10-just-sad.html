<p>How sad is the story of the Tucson tragedy.</p>
<p>Good people died. Good people grieve.</p>
<p>A little girl, born on 9-11, went on her way to her reward. Too soon. So, so too soon.</p>
<p>Experience says that some survivors will become bitter and angry. That&rsquo;s sad, too.</p>
<p>Some will become depressed.</p>
<p>All will weep.&nbsp; Especially the little girl&rsquo;s daddy.&nbsp; (I can&rsquo;t bring myself to write their names&mdash;that would make it too personal for me.&nbsp; Too close.)</p>
<p>I hate to ask you to be sad, but sometimes we must be sad.&nbsp; Political operatives interrupted the grieving process on Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; But we have to grieve.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s cathartic and necessary. Grief is an appropriate emotion. Intense, short grief is the best&mdash;or least bad&mdash;kind. Mild, prolonged grief makes us crazy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s too much of that in the world as it is, as we&rsquo;ve learned this weekend.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord.</p>
<p>Let the perpetual light shine upon them.</p>
<p>May their souls&mdash;and the souls of all the faithful departed&mdash;rest in peace.</p>
<p>Amen.</p></blockquote>
