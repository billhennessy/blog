    Arizona should petition for a recall to have dupnick step down..........AND to have a Grand Jury review his actions of obstruction of justice....failing to perform his job, allowing charges to be fixed, dropped....protecting the interests of the would-be shooter......instead of protecting his victims.....when all the warning signs were there.....leading into the MASSACRE.

    The Sheriff talking his victims out of filing charges.....for previous incidents.......is intimidation..

    Dupnick's duty and obligation is to protect the community......not to operate his position in law enforcement to protect the criminal......even if a family member works for Pima County.

    there should be a thorough investigation......into the identities of all parties....who fixed charges on behalf of this maniac.....to not be held accountable for repeatedly terrorizing a community.......bc by not being held accountable.....caused.his devious acts to escalate.

    Dupnick should serve prison time himself.

    misdemeanor arrest, so don't claim the sheriff gave Loughner slaps on the wrist.

  content: It is time to get rid of people like this.  He is not upholding the Constitution
    of this country much less protecting the people of his county or country.  He
    should be ashamed and hide his head for the rhetoric and hatred he is causing
    in his community.  Sheriff Dubnik, you are a disgrace and you could be the reason
    for further unrest and anger in your community and in the country.  You should
    be fired and never hold another position of rank again!  You are only thinking
    of your own political beliefs not of the people that lost their lives and were
    injured in this terrible incident.  You are disgusting!

  content: Missing the point. As Pima County emloyees/officials, both Sheriff Dupnik
    and Amy Loughner are represented by the Pima County Civil Division. They share
    a lawyer..Amelia Craig-Cramer. If there was any undue influence, it likely occured
    there.

<p><img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:2px 10px 5px 0;" align="left" src="http://www.iill.net/wp-content/uploads/images/clarence-dupnik.jpg" width="140" height="209" />According to an internal Department of Homeland Security memo, Jarod Lee Loughner&rsquo;s mother &ldquo;works for Pima County Board of Supervisors.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>In the memo, <a href="http://gretawire.blogs.foxnews.com/latest-on-shooting-of-congresswoman-giffords-motivation-anti-semitic-and-she-was-the-target/" target="_blank">obtained by Fox News and posted on Greta Van Susteren&rsquo;s blog</a>, the DHS agent openly speculates about undue internal influence.&#160; That&rsquo;s because <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2011/01/arizona-shooter-loughner-has-gun-despite-criminal-record.html" target="_blank">Loughner&rsquo;s arrests don&rsquo;t all end</a> with reasonable closure, if you will.&#160; </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s exactly what the DHS report says:</p>
<blockquote><p>suspect&rsquo;s mother works for the Pima County Board of Supervisors* the suspect has multiple arrests ... But no criminal record? Intervention by someone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to assume that that &ldquo;someone&rdquo; is Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/10/dupnik-friends-critics-remarks-arizona-shooting/" target="_blank">Dupnik took to the airwaves to create a sensation</a>. He accused the people of Arizona, talk radio, Sharon Angle, Sarah Palin, and the tea party of complicity in murder, effectively.&#160; The sheriff did so without evidence.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>If <a href="http://thechollajumps.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/jared-loughner-is-a-product-of-sheriff-dupniks-office/" target="_blank">Dupnik was invol</a>ved in springing Loughner after one of the murderer&rsquo;s many arrests, then Dupnik had strong motive to manufacture a bogeyman.&#160; If <a href="http://www.redstate.com/moe_lane/2011/01/10/did-dupnik-dismiss-loughner-threat/" target="_blank">Dupnik helped keep Loughner stay out of the state psych system</a>, then his motive doubles. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/report-sheriff-knew-about-loughners-actions-previous-threats-failed-to-act/" target="_blank">mounting evidence</a> that <a href="http://extranosalley.com/?p=8731" target="_blank">Dupnik is guilty of both</a>. </p>
<p>We already know that <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/04/29/2010-04-29_arizona_sheriff_clarence_dupnik_refuses_to_enforce_states_new_racist_immigration.html" target="_blank">Dupnik refused to uphold Arizona&rsquo;s SB1070</a>.&#160; We already know that he holds the people of <a href="http://scaredmonkeys.com/2011/01/09/pima-county-sheriff-clarence-dupnik-blames-arizonas-%E2%80%9Cprejudice-bigotry%E2%80%9D-for-shooting-of-u-s-rep-giffords-by-jared-lee-loughner/" target="_blank">Arizona in the highest contempt</a>.&#160; A law enforcement officer who despises the people he&rsquo;s sworn to protect and who refuses to enforce the law he&rsquo;s sworn to uphold is unfit for office.</p>
<p>If I were Arizona&rsquo;s Attorney General, I&rsquo;d be asking putting together a case for some warrants. </p>
<p>But, as Dennis Miller would say, that&rsquo;s just my opinion; I could be wrong. </p>
