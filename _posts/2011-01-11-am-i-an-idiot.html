<p>For most of my life I was na&iuml;ve.&nbsp; I think.</p>
<p>I thought that most people who voted for larger government, higher taxes, tighter regulation, and limits on speech, religion, and assembly, were misguided.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always known and acknowledged that the people who advocated and plotted to concentrate power in the hands of a few were wicked creatures.&nbsp; I never hesitated to attack them head-on.</p>
<p>But the others.&nbsp; The others I sometimes pitied. Other times I belittled.&nbsp; Other times I simply giggled at them.</p>
<p>After the center-left&rsquo;s response to Tucson, I think I might have been wrong.&nbsp; There might not be many &ldquo;good&rdquo; liberals.&nbsp; Maybe most on the center-left are rotten, power-hungry, freedom-hating, murder-using slime.</p>
<p>Please show me I&rsquo;m wrong. Don&rsquo;t bother telling me, because I don&rsquo;t believe a one of you. Show me.</p>
<p>The liberal-progressive-left world has demonstrated the worst of humanness this week.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll take a lot to convince me you haven&rsquo;t sold your souls.</p>
