<p>Just as in 2001, some Republicans are falling for Democrat mind games.&#160; In 2001, it was the shared leadership arrangement in the Senate, even thought the GOP had the majority because of the VP tie-break.&#160; This year, it&rsquo;s beginning with <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/47630.html">&ldquo;bi-partisan&rdquo; seating at the State of the Union</a> address.</p>
<p>I have one message for Republicans:&#160; <strong>Knock it the hell off.</strong></p>
<p>When a Democrat offers to reach across the aisle, with very few exceptions, it&rsquo;s to poison a Republican.&#160; In 2001, Democrats convinced Republicans to thwart the will of the people by letting the minority party run the show.&#160; In 2011, Democrats want the same thing.</p>
<p>On November 2, 2010, the American people handed the Democrats their own behinds on a silver platter.&#160; The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703791904576076373704758778.html">left&rsquo;s embarrassment and humiliation</a> from that election has grown into a rage that resulted in last week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/opinion/15blow.html?_r=1&amp;ref=charlesmblow">failed attempt to blame conservatives</a> for Jarod Lee Loughner&rsquo;s murderous rampage in Tucson.</p>
<p>Having been <a href="http://hennessysview.com/press/a-turning-tide-swamps-all-lefties/">discredited and humiliated in that failed attempt at propaganda</a>, the left now wants to nullify the psychological effect of the SOTU seating chart.&#160; Two House GOP leaders&mdash;Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy&mdash;told Politico that they&rsquo;re on board with this symbolic manure.&#160; Let&rsquo;s tell them what we think of their idiotic plan to nullify the visuals of November 2.</p>
<p><a href="http://cantor.house.gov/contact.htm">Eric Cantor&rsquo;s</a> phone number:&#160; 804.747-4073</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.house.gov/kevinmccarthy/webforms/issue_subscribe.html">Kevin McCarthy&rsquo;s</a> phone:&#160; (202) 225-2915</p>
<p>Doug Powers (on Michelle Malkin&rsquo;s blog) says it&rsquo;ll <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2011/01/15/bipartisan-seating-at-the-state-of-the-union/">all end with a pajama party</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Remember, that other party is the one libeling conservatives, accusing us of being accessories to murder.&#160; </p>
