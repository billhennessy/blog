<p>Last week, America&rsquo;s sleaziest leftists&mdash;Bill Maher, Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann, E. J. Dionne, Paul Krugman, others &ndash; have <a href="http://hennessysview.com/crime/a-national-day-of-shame/">executed a prepared <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/BillMaherAngry.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;margin:2px 10px 5px 0;" title="BillMaherAngry" border="0" alt="BillMaherAngry" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/BillMaherAngry_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="197" /></a>propaganda war</a> against anyone who disagrees with them. Their theorem is: vitriolic rhetoric inspires conservatives to act out in violence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/figures-charles-johnsons-hero-arrested-for-threatening-to-kill-tea-party-leader-on-national-tv/">the loony left</a>, there was no evidence to support their theorem.&#160; The evidence they falsely pointed to&mdash;Jarod Lee Loughner&rsquo;s deranged murder rampage in Tucson&mdash;was determined to be a lie only hours after the event.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Maher, Krugman, Donne, Matthews, and crew continued to lie, lie, lie, lie.&#160; They refused to let go of their story, false though it was.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the leftist &ldquo;rhetoric = violence&rdquo; cult got something close to vindication.&#160; Perhaps responding to the hateful, <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2011/01/15/quotes-of-the-day-570/">violent rhetoric from Krugman, Matthews, Maher, Dionne, and Olbermann</a>, Tucson shooting victim and <a href="http://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/01/16/activist-who-made-death-threat-to-tea-party-leader-committed-for-a-psychiatric-evaluation/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BigGovernment+(Big+Government)">hard-left activist, J. Eric Fuller, was arrested</a> for communicating a direct threat against a tea party leader in Tucson. (<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2011/01/15/tucson-shooting-victim-charged-for-death-threat-to-tea-party-leader/">More at Michelle Malkin</a>.)</p>
<p>Fuller issued the threat after photographing tea party leader Trent Humphries. (Was the photo&rsquo;s purpose to help the hit man ID the target?)</p>
<p>If Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, et al, were correct in their assessment of blame to conservatives, then Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, et al, are at least as guilty of conveying a threat as Fuller.</p>
<p>But if Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, et al, were wrong about rightwing rhetoric, than I am wrong about their culpability in Eric Fuller&rsquo;s psycho moment.</p>
<p>I think there are only two people responsible for their criminal actions: Loughner and Fuller. But I think Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, Dionne, et al, are guilty of exploiting tragedy and emotions to destroy their political opponents.</p>
