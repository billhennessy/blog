<p>Last week, the Illinois legislature passed a massive income tax increase on individuals and businesses.&nbsp; Overall, it represents about a 67 percent income tax increase.</p>
<p>In response, neighboring <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110113/ap_on_re_us/us_broken_budgets_battling_for_business">states of Wisconsin and Indiana</a> have wisely mounted massive campaigns to suck businesses and people out of Illinois.&nbsp; Even New Jersey&rsquo;s fabulous governor, <a href="http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2011/01/14/chris-christie-to-pluck-business-from-illinois/">Chris Christie, plans to fish the Land o&rsquo; Lincoln</a> for some business transplants.</p>
<p>One state bordering Illinois has been notoriously silent.&nbsp; Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has done <em>nothing</em> to steal business and residents away from Illinois.</p>
<p>Is Nixon being lazy?&nbsp; Or is he just being a good Democrat?</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, why isn&rsquo;t St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay beating the bushes on the East Side?&nbsp; The city needs business and people desperately, but Slay has been as silent as Nixon.</p>
<p>Look, people, I realize that we have a lot of friends in Illinois.&nbsp; My wife is from GC.&nbsp; Most of her family lives in Madison County.&nbsp; But <a href="http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2011/01/12/illinois-taxing-its-way-to-prosperity/">businesses and workers are going to flee to the state</a>.&nbsp; Illinois dropped from the 23rd best tax state to the 36th in one step.&nbsp; With Democrats in charge of the legislature and the governorship, this increase is only the beginning.&nbsp; Illinois taxes will rise until the people in Illinois elect tax cutting budget hawks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jay Nixon has an obligation to put Missouri&rsquo;s economy ahead of Democrat party loyalties.&nbsp; Missouri needs to follow the leads of Indiana, Wisconsin, and New Jersey by campaigning for fleeing Illinois businesses and people.</p>
<p>*UPDATE* Over on United for Missouri, <a href="http://www.unitedformissouri.org/statewide/illinois-jumps-shark-income-tax/">Emily Iles explains the extraordinary dangers to Illinois' economy</a> this tax hike poses.</p>
