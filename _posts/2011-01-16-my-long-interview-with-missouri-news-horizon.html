<p>When I hear all the lies, slanders, and threats against the Tea Party movement from folks on the left, I wish I could counter with a fuller examination of my beliefs. Luckily, with the help of Missouri News Horizon, I can.</p>
<p>The Friday before the 9/12 Tea Party, <a href="http://monewshorizonblog.org/2010/09/an-interview-with-st-louis-tea-party-leader-bill-hennessy/">I sat down with Rebecca Townsend</a> to talk about the Tea Party.</p>
<p>Rebecca and I chatted for an hour.&nbsp; She led me through just about every aspect of the Tea Party&rsquo;s history up to that point.&nbsp; We also talked about its future.</p>
<p>The time of the interview&rsquo;s release was tough.&nbsp; It went to press on 9/11, the day before Gateway to November.&nbsp; Immediately after, we opened our Victory HQ on Hampton and dove into full campaign mode.</p>
<p>Rebecca&rsquo;s totally fair coverage&mdash;she published the transcript and video whole, without edits&mdash;deserves more exposure.</p>
<p>Please feel free to <a href="http://monewshorizonblog.org/2010/09/an-interview-with-st-louis-tea-party-leader-bill-hennessy/">point out this interview</a> to anyone who wants to know how I think or what I believe.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q: WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF WHAT?</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to make sure people understand the founding principles of our country. Those founding principles may be well known, there&rsquo;s key phrases we all know, but the thinking behind them I think we tend to forget about because we know the phrases so well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why Jefferson said the &ldquo;pursuit of happiness&rdquo; instead of property, which was the popular phrase of the day &ndash; life, liberty and property.</p>
<p>Pursuit of happiness may include the pursuit of private property, but it goes far beyond that. There&rsquo;s a school of thought that says he chose that because property was so closely associated with slavery and he didn&rsquo;t want to codify the idea of owning another human being. That may have been part of it, but I believe there&rsquo;s more to it than that.</p>
<p>The pursuit of happiness: There&rsquo;s a Harvard researcher named <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/01/the-science-of-happiness.html">Nancy Etcoff</a>, who begins a fantastic<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_etcoff_on_happiness_and_why_we_want_it.html">TED.com talk</a> by saying, &ldquo;We are wired to pursue happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way she phrased that is very important. She didn&rsquo;t say we are wired to be happy, but we&rsquo;re wired to pursue happiness. She went on to say &ldquo;not only achieve it, but pursue it again and again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know from neuroscience and psychology that a person who is paralyzed and a person who wins the lottery one year after the event will have an equal degree of happiness. Because happiness&hellip;we&rsquo;re driven to want to better ourselves and the world around us. The pursuit of happiness &ndash; and Jefferson couldn&rsquo;t have known this because we didn&rsquo;t have the science at the time &ndash; but he was right, he was way ahead of his time. The pursuit of happiness is as important a right to human beings as the right to defend ourselves from attack.</p>
<p>Going back to the idea that of the negative emotions prevent us from being eaten by tigers and positive emotions prevent us from becoming tigers, if we&rsquo;re denied the pursuit of happiness, we&rsquo;re denied the right not to become miserable creatures &ndash;miserable to ourselves and miserable to those around us.</p>
<p>In the old Soviet Union in Moscow they did make sure everybody had their basic needs were met. And everyone I&rsquo;ve met who lived through that era said life was just miserable. Everyone was unhappy. They squabbled, they complained. It was like existing but not being alive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when government tries to replace our pursuit of happiness with their idea of happiness. Until we establish a good understanding of how important the pursuit of happiness&hellip;the unfettered right to pursue of happiness so long as it doesn&rsquo;t deny someone the right to pursue happiness&hellip; until we understand that, we&rsquo;re in danger of losing that and living the way the Muscovites lived for 70-some years.</p></blockquote>
