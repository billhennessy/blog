  content: 'Love the picture of  Little Billy.  Nice image of him actually.  Shows
    his REAL personality and how pissed he is that he''s only 4'' 2" tall.  Don''t
    let it bother you, Billy or you may have to go into time-out.  Your Mommy wouldn''t
    be happy with you if you continue to act out.  '

<p>What would <em>you</em> do?&#160; </p>
<p>Suppose you did something stupid.&#160; You blamed the wrong person, for instance, for a capital crime.&#160; Then supposed one of your comrades compounded your . . . error . . . by threatening to kill someone on national television?</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/BillMaherAngry1.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="BillMaherAngry" border="0" alt="BillMaherAngry" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/BillMaherAngry_thumb1.jpg" width="244" height="197" /></a>If you&rsquo;re an American leftist, you might double down by issuing even <em>more</em> death threats to even <em>more</em> people. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo; happening right now in America.&#160; Death threats are pouring into Trent Humphries, Tucson Tea Party organizer, <a href="http://teapartyfi.com/news/Dana-Loesch-Gets-Death-Threats-in-Wake-of-Arizona-Shooting-1859628.html">Dana Loesch</a>, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2011/01/17/shut-me-up/">Sarah Palin (who vows not to be silenced)</a>, <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/glenn-beck-opens-up-about-violence-i-have-15-operating-threats-on-me-at-any-given-time/">Glenn Beck</a>, and more.&#160; The self-proclaimed conscience of America&mdash;collectivist lefists&mdash;have essentially declared war on the right.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> and the <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/st-louis-tea-party-stands-in-solidarity-with-trent-humphries-and-the-tucson-tea-party/">St. Louis Tea Party Coalition issued a press release</a> on January 17 denouncing the left&rsquo;s continued threat of violence as means of advancing its anti-liberty agenda.</p>
<p>To counter the left&rsquo;s increasing vitriol and violence, please publicly thank three people today. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start:</p>
<p>Thank you, Jim Hoft, for bringing to our attention the mounting threats Trent Humphries is receiving. </p>
<p>Thank you, Jen Ennenbach for crafting a great press release on the issues.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dana Loesch, for continuing to keep our voices in the national ear.</p>
<p>And a bonus:&#160; thank you for honoring by reading my little web missives.&#160; </p>
<p>*UPDATE* <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/17/arizona.shooting.fuller/index.html">J. Eric Fuller issues apology</a> to Trent Humphries.</p>
