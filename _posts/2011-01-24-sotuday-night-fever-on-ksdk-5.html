  content: Why not a "shot" every time Nancy Pelosi pops up!
---
<p>I&rsquo;ll participate on KSDK Channel 5&rsquo;s post-SOTU discussion panel Tuesday following the State of the Union speech. (I being Bill Hennessy, in case you&rsquo;re reading this from a news feed.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who my fellow panelists will be, but I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool that a local network invited a tea partier to help break down the President&rsquo;s State of the Union speech. </p>
<p>The speech starts at 8:00 p.m. CT Tuesday, January 25 on&#160; <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/" target="_blank">KSDK 5</a>. The analysis follows.&#160; </p>

<p><strong>Other ideas to make the evening more meaningful:</strong></p>
<p>* Start an office pool on what I wear</p>
<p>* Do a shot every time Barry says &ldquo;perfectly clear&rdquo;    </p>
<p>* Draw a picture of Nancy Pelosi when John Boehner announces the President</p>
<p>* Have your kids interrupt with applause every time you say something really, really witty at the TV</p>
<p>* In the comments below, post the snarky answers I should have given instead of the lame, unintelligible responses I actually give</p>
<p>* Add your own ideas below</p>
