<p>Last week <a href="http://hennessysview.com/free-markets/what-we-learned-from-milton-friedman/" target="_blank">I wrote about Creating Shared Value</a>. In that post, I pointed to a Harvard Business Review <a href="https://archive.harvardbusiness.org/cla/web/pl/product.seam?c=8062&amp;i=8064&amp;cs=1b64dfac8e4d2ef4da5976b5665c5540" target="_blank">article by Michael Porter</a> and Mark Kramer. If you haven&rsquo;t read both my post and the Michael Porter piece, please do so now.&#160; I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re up to date, let me add the Tea Party angle to this.&#160; </p>
<p>Though Porter did not dwell on government&rsquo;s role in Creating Shared Value (CSV), he did point out that government must reform for CSV to succeed.&#160; Here are a few of the Tea Party reforms necessary if Porter&rsquo;s (and Whole Foods CEO John Mackey&rsquo;s) vision is to succeed:</p>
<p><strong>Stop Vilifying Business</strong>:&#160; Both parties fail to defend business when business is unfairly attacked.&#160; Instead, politicians tend to jump on the populist bandwagon, piling on companies and industries. One example:&#160; the regulation of cable television in the early 1990s.&#160; Responding to false claims that cable companies were gouging customers, Congress stepped in and imposed regulations that caused cable rates to increase faster and customer satisfaction to tumble.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Stop Picking Winners</strong>:&#160; General Motors, Chrysler, Bank of America, Citigroup, and dozens of other banks and businesses should have failed.&#160; Only illegal and inappropriate government interference in the market saved these companies, transferring financial responsibility from the owners to the tax payers.&#160; Regardless of future performance, our economy is worse off than it would have been had government stayed out of the mess.&#160; Moreover, innovation and ideas that might have improved the world and increased sustainability are lost because government&rsquo;s clunky hand manipulated the markets.</p>
<p><strong>Stop Creating Entitlements</strong>: Welfare reform gave us a few years of federal budget surplus. With Barack Obama&rsquo;s historical and dangerous deficits, the last thing we needed was a new entitlement. But Obama and the 111th Congress gave us just that with health control.&#160; John Mackey of Whole Foods pointed out a system that many employers offer that reduces healthcare costs and makes good insurance affordable for everyone.&#160; Were affordable health insurance Obama&rsquo;s actual goal, he would have embraced the high deductible solution. Instead, he outlawed it.&#160; Government must eliminate all entitlements, not make new ones, if CSV is to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Reform the Tax Code</strong>:&#160; Most of the our favorite tax breaks&mdash;designed to change behavior&mdash;will go away in order to pay off massive deficits brought about by entitlements and political handouts.&#160; It&rsquo;s time, then, to flatten out the tax code.&#160; That means establishing in a tax-free income level (say $20,000), and a tax rate (say 18 percent).&#160; The new 1040 looks like this:</p>
<p>Income:________ &ndash; $20,000 = _____________ * 0.18 = Tax Due ______________</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Creating Shared Value is a business strategy.&#160; Fully embraced, it offers the possibility of remarkable growth for companies, communities, and economies.&#160; It rejects the notion of trade-offs, like clean air or full employment. Instead, it means clean air <em>because of</em>&#160; full employment. </p>
<p>Companies can reach CSV only if government gets out of their way.&#160; And if companies get out of their own ways.&#160; But Michael Porter has advanced a strong argument for the later.&#160; Now it&rsquo;s time for the Tea Party to encourage government to do its part. </p>
<p>How else can government help advance Creating Shared Value by reducing its size, scope, and cost?&#160; Leave your thoughts below in the comments. </p>
