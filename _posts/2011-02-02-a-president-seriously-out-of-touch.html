<p>Did you enjoy President Obama&rsquo;s gooey nostalgia for the Happy Days of Eisenhower and Howdy Doody as much I did? </p>

<p>Saul Alinsky warned radicals to &ldquo;never go outside the expertise of your people.&rdquo;&#160; But desperate times call for desperate measures, so Obama jumped the shark to the time of Potsy and Fonzie and Joannie Loves Chachi to rekindle a flavor of Americana that died a couple of years before Obama was born. Or that never actually existed. Take your pick.</p>
<p>I read the address before the speech started, thanks to prime seating at KSDK&rsquo;s studio on Market Street.&#160; I was surprised at its brevity, its vagueness, its silliness, and its meaninglessness. </p>
<p>Going beyond the direct references to the 50s, Obama tried to evoke the supposed blandness of the 50s that the kids in the 60s criticized so much.&#160; That was his only success of the night. </p>
<blockquote><p>The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can't just stand still. As Robert Kennedy told us, "The future is not a gift. It is an achievement." Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across the table from me were three Democrats. They looked pained at Obama&rsquo;s sloooooowww delivery and his jokes that bombed both in the House chamber in Channel 5&rsquo;s studio.&#160; As Peggy Noonan said, in her column aptly title<em> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704268104576108423310124538.html" target="_blank">An Unserious Speech Misses the Mark</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The State of the Union speech was not centrist, as it should have been, but merely mushy, and barely relevant. It wasted a perfectly good analogy&mdash;America is in a Sputnik moment&mdash;by following it with narrow, redundant and essentially meaningless initiatives. Rhetorically the speech lay there like a lox, as if the document itself knew it was dishonest, felt embarrassed, and wanted to curl up quietly in a corner of the podium and hide. But the president insisted on reading it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And reading it poorly, I might add. </p>
<p>In the post-SOTU interview, I said, &ldquo;It was as if his writers erased everything he believes in.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>My comment was as much about Obama&rsquo;s slack attitude as about the address&rsquo;s vacuous content.&#160; Obama clearly didn&rsquo;t believe a damn word he said, and he seemed not to care who knew it.&#160; </p>
<p>In the end, the State of the Union speech may go down as an emblem of Obama administration: wasteful, boring, phony, weak, and poorly delivered by a president who&rsquo;s seriously out of touch with our purpose as a nation.</p>
