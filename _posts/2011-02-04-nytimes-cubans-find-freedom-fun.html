<p>Since mass murderer Fidel Castro fired thousands of Cuban government workers due to the economic unviability of Obamanomics, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/world/americas/04cuba.html?_r=1&amp;hp" target="_blank">those set free are enjoying their independence</a>.&#160; To the shock of the New York Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I feel useful; I&rsquo;m independent,&rdquo; said Ms. &Aacute;lvarez, who opened a small cafe in November at her home in this scruffy town 25 miles from the capital, Havana. &ldquo;When you sit down at the end of the day and look at how much you have made, you feel satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only the NYT would explain the wonders of economic freedom to Fidel&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute; in the White House. </p>
