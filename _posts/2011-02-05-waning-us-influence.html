    Must have been the speech he made in Cairo. I know I want to revolt everytime I hear him open his mouth and drone on and on!

<p>Pro-Western governments in these countries have fallen to anti-American forces or diminished their support for the US since Barack Obama became president.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lebanon</li>
<li>Jordan</li>
<li>Yemen</li>
<li>Qatar</li>
<li>Egypt</li>
<li>Turkey</li>
</ul>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign promise to restore respect for America around the world is a joke.&#160; A cruel and dangerous joke.&#160; Our enemies see Obama&rsquo;s weakness as American weakness. As they did during Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s failed presidency, those enemies are advancing. </p>
<p>The next president will have more than a financial catastrophe to fix.</p>
