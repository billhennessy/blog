<p>I&rsquo;m torn. </p>
<p><img style="display:inline;float:left;" align="left" src="http://www.mlbsluggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/albert-pujols2.jpg" width="217" height="266" />Yesterday, I took part in a <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/02/tea-party-soup-line-forms-at-mccaskills-st-louis-office/" target="_blank">demonstration outside Senator Claire McCaskill&rsquo;s</a> St. Louis office on Delmar.&#160; The future of the republic is important.&#160; We are concerned that Senator McCaskill put her re-election before Missouri jobs by lobbying the DNC to hold its 2012 convention in Charlotte, NC, instead of St. Louis, MO. </p>
<p>Down the road, a group of <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/02/05/fans-gather-to-urge-pujols-signing/" target="_blank">Cardinals fans held a demonstration outside Busch Stadium</a>.&#160; The future of future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols is important, too.&#160; It appears the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/article_e67d388c-7514-55d4-b468-8ad6ad8780be.html" target="_blank">Cardinals owners have little interest in resigning Albert</a>. </p>
<p>Both events drew about 25 participants. </p>
<p>If St. Louis is America&rsquo;s baseball city, and the possible exodus of the greatest ballplayer of our generation draws equally with a tea party event, then is St. Louis also America&rsquo;s tea party city?</p>
<p>Oh, and the torn part.&#160; The next general election is in November 2012.&#160; Pujols becomes a free agent, effectively, in nine days.&#160; Maybe I should I have been at the stadium yesterday, instead?</p>
