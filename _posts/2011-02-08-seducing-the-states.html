<p>You can&rsquo;t call yourself a conservative and ask for education money from Washington.</p>
<p>Republicans dominate both houses of the Missouri legislature.&#160; You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d act like republicans (lower case).&#160; But when it comes to education bribes from Washington, many of our Republican legislators show little resistance to political seduction. We can help them.</p>
<p>On BigGovernment. com, <a href="http://biggovernment.com/bmccarty/2011/02/05/why-are-so-many-states-embracing-federal-control-of-education-while-siding-against-obamacare/" target="_blank">Bob McCarty highlights the hypocrisy</a> of blasting ObamaCare from one side of the mouth while begging for federal cash out of the other.&#160; He points to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DOCH1YT6Uk" target="_blank">Heritage Foundation video</a> that features our own <a href="http://www.missourieducationwatchdog.com/" target="_blank">education watch dog Gretchen Logue</a>.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=27895" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan never got around to dismantling the Department of Education</a>. In the year of his 100th birthday, let&rsquo;s honor him by resisting the seduction of Washington bribes.&#160; The Constitution is clearly silent on the issue, which means the 10th Amendment prohibits appropriations for local schools.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s What You Can Do</strong></p>
<p>Contact your Missouri State Legislators today and ask them to send Arne Duncan&rsquo;s bribe back to DC.&#160; Call or email your Missouri <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/llookup/leg_lookup.aspx">State Rep</a>. and <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/11info/senalpha.htm">Senator</a>. Tell them to send DC's Education Bribe back where it came from.</p>
<p>Senators Lembke and Nieves are trying to #senditback.&#160; And they need our help.</p>
<p>Call or email now.</p>
<p><strong>Then Do One More Thing</strong></p>
<p>In addition to calling or writing, please do the following:</p>

<p><b>Don't Listen to the Liberal Lies</b>
<p>If Missouri takes Arne Duncan's bribe, it will simply INCREASE general spending, not education spending.&#160; That's just the way government works.&#160; </p>
<p>By returning this bribe (and its burdensome handcuffs), we'll send a message--and instill fiscal responsiblity in both Jeff City and Washington.</p>
<p>Please call your state <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/llookup/leg_lookup.aspx">Representative </a>and <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/11info/senalpha.htm">Senator</a> today.&#160; </p>
