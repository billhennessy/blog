  content: I've been enamored of Michelle's style since I started regularly reading
    her blog over a year ago. It's my sincere hope that she gets the help she needs,
    and I'll keep her in my thoughts. Having a mother nearing the late-stages of kidney
    failure (diabetes), I have something of an idea of the hell she's going through.
    It hurts, and I hope she is able to get well.

<p><img style="display:inline;float:left;" align="left" src="http://journeymapp.com/hennessysview/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/warrencoteaparty-michelle3.jpg?w=119" />The first St. Louis Tea Partier was Michelle Moore.&#160; In the annals of the Tea Party movement, the first action was a conference call held February 20, 2009.&#160; The only St. Louisan known to be on that call was Michelle Moore.</p>
<p>Now, Michelle needs our help.&#160; Michelle needs a kidney.&#160; She details everything (in living color) on <a href="http://www.atraditionallifelived.com/2011/02/kideny-update-no-bikini-for-youand.html" target="_blank">her blog, A Traditional Life Lived</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>If you can help&mdash;if you can&rsquo;t point a donor her way&mdash;please do.&#160; And if you can&rsquo;t, prayers are always welcome.&#160; </p>
