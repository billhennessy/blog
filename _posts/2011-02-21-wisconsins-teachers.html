  content: "Agreed. Reminds me of Chris Christie's remarks a few months ago regarding
    NJ's teacher's union. It was something like: \"No one forced you to become a teacher,
    and if you chose that profession for the money you've made a mistake\". \nThe
    best teacher I've ever had was at a tech school I attended. He'd built up then
    sold a very successful business in the area where he taught (information systems
    management) which made him independently wealthy, and he told us his teaching
    salary didn't even cover his gas to drive the 1.5 hours each way to teach everyday....but,
    he told us, he enjoyed passing on his skills and enlightening others SO MUCH he'd
    have done it for free. We need more teachers like him."

<p>Let&rsquo;s knock off the silly political correctness, here, and admit what&rsquo;s going in Wisconsin. The teachers are trying collapse the system.&#160; </p>
<p>The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control.&#160; Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsin&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO.&#160; Fire them.&#160; Fire them all and revoke their certifications.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/02/nine-violent-protesters-arrested-in-madison-wisconsin/" target="_blank">Wisconsin&rsquo;s striking teachers</a> are not educators, they&rsquo;re conquistadors.&#160; Fire them.&#160; Let them start over. </p>
