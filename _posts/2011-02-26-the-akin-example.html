  content: "I completely agree. I voted for Todd all the way back in 2000 and every
    time since. I've written letters to him several times asking for support or clarification
    on various issues and he has responded personally (or at least what looks a lot
    like personally) every time. Apparently that is rare these days, from what I hear.
    I would have to say I am 100% satisfied with his representation. \nClaire McCaskill
    on the other hand has NEVER responded to any correspondence whatsoever. Not even
    form letters. That's not helping you get my vote, Claire-Bear!"

  content: "After a few votes, I emailed Todd and said I will no longer be voting
    for him.  I don't know if I have ever gotten a response from his office through
    emails, whereas Claire has sent form letter responses, which isn't much better.
    \ \n\nAnyway before  he jumped into the tea party movement I told him I wouldn't
    be voting for him again.  His earmarks just floor me. I wish Blaine Luetkemeyer
    was my rep as he has done a great job of not accepting any earmarks ever. Here
    was the letter I sent him in December of 2009.  No response(not that I expected
    one from him).\n\n\nCongressman Akin,\n\nI feel the need to inform you that as
    much as I agree with most of what you say, it is some of the things you have done
    that make me feel as though I cannot support you in the next election cycle.\n\nI
    have watched you speak on CSPAN about the healthcare issue and agree with you
    wholeheartedly.  I believe that it will bankrupt America.  But if you believe
    that that is the only thing that federal money is not supposed to go to then you
    are wrong.  I looked at your earmarks for last year and was not impressed at all.
    \ This year I have become more distraught over them especially with the enormous
    spending and economic shape we are currently in.  Again I don't believe in government
    intervention in healthcare, but saying that spending money on healthcare is bad
    when you want to ship $155M for your and your co-sponsored projects is just as
    bad.\n\nI understand why you want to ship defense money here, if it isn't spent
    here, it will be spent somewhere. I do believe this is wrong but I don't seriously
    fault you for it because another congressman will jump in and try to get those
    contracts in their location.  Ultimately, this would be part of the defense budget
    and should not be going into your earmarks, the defense dept should bid on these
    contracts like any other type of contractor and congressmen really shouldn't have
    any input(just my opinion).\n\nUpgrades to highway 61 and 79(also I know you had
    sponsored upgrades to 141 and the page extension).  These are straight out wrong.
    \ There is no reason that the taxpayers in New York or California should be paying
    to fix a road in Troy, Missouri or a bridge in Elsberry, Missouri.  I live right
    by 141 and drive it all the time, if the residents of West County feel it needs
    to be upgraded, they should pay for it, just as the people of Troy/Lincoln county
    should pay for their roads and bridges.  I am angry that I pay to fix roads in
    Possum Hollow, AR and they should be mad if their money goes to fix 141.\n\nBut
    the real icing on the cake and what makes me truly not want to support you in
    2010 is the $21M in earmark spending for the Chesterfield bottoms area.  You have
    been in this area long enough to know that prior to the flood of '93 the bottoms
    had nothing but a highway and farms.  The flood came and devastated the farms,
    businesses decided that the land was in a great location and cheap(since it was
    flood prone).  So now these business get cheap land and in return the federal
    government based on your earmark will strengthen that area and make their land
    values increase.  I believe if the risk was that great of these businesses losing
    everything, they would and should be responsible for raising the money to help
    prevent a flood of their business.  They knew what they were getting into when
    they moved to that area.  To me this is a matter of personal responsibility and
    if you do not stand for personal responsibility, I cannot stand for you.\n"

  content: 'I understand your concern about earmarks.  But earmarks are not the be-all,
    end-all of government.  In fact, if it comes down to Todd Akin or some Obama-appointed
    czar deciding how to spend money, I''ll take Todd Akin''s judgment every day of
    the week. '

<p>Todd Akin need doesn&rsquo;t to build tea party street cred. He thumps primary and general election opponents in biennial blowouts for Missouri&rsquo;s Second District.&#160; Todd is also a legitimate, committed member of the US House Tea Party Caucus.&#160; Todd Akin is the last politician who needs to prove his tea party cred.&#160; We trust him.</p>

<p><strong>Akin Lives the Message</strong></p>
<p>So when Todd Akin dashed from Springfield to Jefferson City to address the "Restore Common Sense&rdquo; rally on the south steps of the Missouri Capitol, he didn&rsquo;t do it to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; anything.&#160; He did it because Todd Akin believes what we believe: that governments and unions for government workers are bankrupting our futures. </p>
<p>Todd Akin didn&rsquo;t need the message embodied by the tea party&mdash;Todd Akin <em>lives and breathes</em> the spirit of the tea party.&#160; </p>
<p>We need more Todd Akins in every level of government. </p>
<p><strong>What You Can Do</strong></p>
<p>When our politicians do the right thing, we need to be as loud in support as we are in dissent when they stray.&#160; Let&rsquo;s begin by sending Todd Akin a thank you note for making the 5-hour round trip to Jefferson City today.&#160; </p>
