  content: "Dear Mr. Hennessey, I am so glad the turnout for the rally on Saturday
    was such a huge success. It is a testament to the strength of passion in the hearts
    of TeaParty supporters. Because a free will action of the \"collective\" people
    was able to organize and gather to voice a message on such short notice should
    send a message loudly and clearly to elected representation like no other action.
    WE ARE WATCHING!\n\nA TeaParty caucus with individuals who have taken large amounts
    of money from special interests and aligned themselves with antiquated party agendas
    will not change the status quo. Joining/working in an already corrupt system pulls
    you into the system you are trying to change. The TeaParty does its greatest service
    to the people and the country by focusing on and empowering those to vote out
    of office the sorry backsides of individual legislators who have abandoned their
    character, promises, and oath to uphold the Constitution. Your strength is with
    your ability to inform and organize your message with the people, not the legislatives
    body. If they can't see the sleeping giant has awakened, then maybe they will
    figure it out when they are no longer in office. They also need to understand
    they serve the people, not the check books of the rich with agendas of their own.\n\nYou're
    not going to get them to back off their chosen direction. They have already sold
    their souls. The best thing the TeaParty can do is to rally around and support
    the freshmen, promise to work against corrupt leadership in the upcoming elections,
    (You have had so much success there in the past) and keep shining light in those
    dark, dark, places in capitols across the country. \n\nI am so happy to be a part
    of and support the TeaParty movement."

  content: "It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it comes from the left or the right, a government
    with too much concentrated power is a threat to the natural rights of individuals.
    \n\nThe Tea Party challenge is to upset the established order. Campaign finance
    and lobby reform might be two avenues to accomplish this. Otherwise the Tea Parties
    over time, could become just more components of a defective political machine,
    that like every other interest, pays for its representation."

  content: 'I''m afraid that if I say more, it will only bring more problems for the
    tea partiers in Jefferson City.  The legislature is designed (with rules) to make
    life painful for renegade representatives.  Some of those rules are necessary
    to maintain order.  But when the majority uses the grassroots for its purposes,
    then cuts off the power of those the grassroots elected, trouble begins.    '

  content: "Part of the problem, I think, with politicians and party leaders is that
    many put their personal careers before, even, their personal beliefs. They say
    \"I must have this office to carry out my beliefs.\" But they never find the right
    office on which to take that heroic stand.\n\nWell, let me suggest this:  take
    your stand in the office you currently hold.  If your beliefs are right and just,
    we will move into a higher office--or retain you in the current one. If you're
    out of touch, we'll retire you. Either, you'll be able to look us in the eye and
    say, \"I lived my truths.\"\n\nAs Todd Akin says, it's really not that hard. "

  content: it is interesting to note that less than 100 years ago, it was acceptable
    practice for doctors to prescribe tonics with morphine, cocaine, and alcohol to
    control coughs and colds. We know today that was a mistake, and cost many lives.
    There is a parallel with medicinal marijuana. And with ObamaCare, pallative care,
    such as marijuna and opiates, may be the only choice even in treatable cases.
    Depends on if the commission in charge decides your life is worth $aving.

  content: Then don't say anything at all...........you are only stirring a pot that
    probably doesn't have anything in it YET.  We are all on the same side and must
    work within the system to make the change.  To thumb out noses at the systems
    only leaves us one place............on the outside!

  content: I mean my comments with all due respect to activist like Mr. Hennessy,
    who are engaged in the process of government.  But, as someone who is also engaged
    in the same process and wants to make a difference in her community, state and
    nation, I am growing inpatient with the generalities being thrown out to our hardworking,
    dedicated lawmakers and accusing them of unfounded allegations (or in the case
    of Mr. Hennessy no specifics what so ever)  As most of you know, I don't mind
    opposing views, especially among my own like minded conservatives, but let's bring
    those views, opinions IDEAS to the table and work together for the best possible
    legislation.  We are not going to get it 100% perfect the first time around, but
    we must start somewhere (education and defiect spending to name a few).  Look
    what pro-lifers have accomplished in the abortion arena; little by little we are
    pealing away at easy access to abortions.  Where would the pro-life movement be
    if they were so stubborn, hard headed and unyeilding working with pro-life lawmakers
    and refused to support every piece of pro-life legislation that did not absolutely
    band all abortions?  The movement would be nowhere.  Thank God, that is not what
    the pro-lifers did.  Instead each year they came to the table with the like minded
    lawmakers with ideas and proposals on how to slowly but surely peal away the easy
    access to abortions.  Praise Jesus.   Just because our republican lawmakers join
    their collegues on "the other side' does not mean they are selling out.  If they
    are selling out on a true conservative principle, TELL US, but be specific.  Do
    not leave us hanging and do not assume everyone that reads your blogs are insiders
    and follow Jeff City and Washington business every minute of the day.  Thank you
    to my fellow conservative political activist for all your time, effort, passion,
    energy and love for this country.  Let us work together, not against.  Throwing
    flames to start a "fire" is not the way to work.

  content: "Now more than ever we need to write letters and make calls of support
    to those Freshman Reps who have stood their ground to the politics as usual political
    bullies who attempt to intimidate based on \"seniority.\" I'm proud of them for
    making a stand. They're doing what we elected them to do. \nSarah Palin took care
    of the Good 'ol Boys in Alaska. Our newly elected Missouri Reps can do the same
    and with our support WILL do the same. "

<p><img style="display:inline;float:left;" align="left" src="http://ferrelljenkins.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/missouri_capitol-t.jpg" width="251" height="162" />I continue hearing reliable reports that the GOP Leadership in the Missouri House keeps its boot on the throat of&#160; Tea Party freshmen. </p>
<p>What a shame.</p>
<p>The party that was flat on its back from 2006 to 2009 rose back to power because of the tea party. But, it seems, the Missouri branch of the party didn&rsquo;t get the message.&#160; And its Speaker in the Missouri House has become tighter with left-fringe Democrats that with conservatives of his own party. </p>
<p>Maybe tea party legislators need a Tea Party Caucus in Jefferson City. </p>
<p>If the Missouri House Republican leaders don&rsquo;t get the message soon, their big majority will disappear in the blink of an eye, and statewide Republican candidates will pay the price. </p>
<p>So will our country. </p>
