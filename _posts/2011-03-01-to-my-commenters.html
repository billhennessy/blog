  content: "Makes perfect sense to me, Bill.  There are LOTS of insane people out
    there who can't differentiate between commentary and hate speech.  They are empowered
    by hiding behind a keyboard and a monitor.  Were they to make those threats in
    the light of day they might find themselves behind bars where they belong.  Stay
    safe.\nMary Syron    "

<p>I love getting lots of comments, and I encourage you to comment more.&#160; (Just say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; if that&rsquo;s all you can think of.)&#160; But I want to clear up some misunderstandings about the way comments work. </p>
<p>Over the weekend, a commenter got quite upset at me because her words didn&rsquo;t appear on my blog 30 seconds after she his Submit. </p>
<p><font color="#c0504d">That&rsquo;s by design.</font></p>
<p>My comments are moderated.&#160; Believe it or not, I attract lunatic-fringe commenters who like to describe the shape and smell of the bullet they intend to use on me.&#160; That stuff doesn&rsquo;t belong on the site, and the only way to keep it off is to moderate comments.&#160; </p>
<p>Frequent, acceptable commenters I might white-list so that their comments appear immediately. </p>
<p>Those who know me know that I have a more-than-full-time job, a family, and other obligations.&#160; Therefore,&#160; <font color="#c0504d">comments may sit in queue for up to a day</font>. And I reserve the right to block any comment.&#160; </p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding. </p>
