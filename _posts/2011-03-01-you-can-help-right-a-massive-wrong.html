    I've asked 5 people to do the same.  (Actually, I've asked the hundreds would

    \ \n\nPlease do the same.  As I said, these are decent guys who deserve our help
    in keeping on the right path. "

  content: "Here is the email response I received from expressing concern of the GOP
    filibuster of this bill:\n\nMy name is Shawn Furey and I am the Chief of Staff
    for Sen. Eric Schmitt.\n\n \n\nI want to address your concerns about Sen. Schmitt&rsquo;s
    position on HB 466, the Paycheck Protection Bill. This bill has only just recently
    had a hearing in the House Committee on Workplace Development &amp; Workplace
    Safety. It has not come up for a final vote in the House, nor has it been introduced
    in the Senate.\n\n \n\nSen. Schmitt has never threatened to filibuster this proposal,
    and he actually agrees with it in principle. Because this bill has not yet come
    to the Senate, Sen. Schmitt has not had the opportunity to review the full substance
    of the bill, so I cannot speak definitively about his official stance on this
    version. I can, however, promise you that Sen. Schmitt has no intention of conducting
    a filibuster against this bill, nor has he ever.\n\n \n\nI do want to thank you
    for sharing your concerns about this topic. The senator is mindful that this is
    an important issue for many people, and he intends to carefully review this proposal
    and all other proposals that come before the Senate.\n\n \n\nThank you,\n\nShawn
    Furey"

    After forwarding Bill H's article to my father and other conservatives I know I received this response from my father who also called those offices:

    James;

    I called both Senate Offices, and also forwarded your e-mail to a good conservative friend with loads of Tea Party Connections.


    Schmitt's office claimed ignorance, saying that he had not yet read the bill and doesn't know what is in it, therefore hasn't made up his mind.

    Engler's Legislative Assistant says that he also has not seen the House Bill but was against a "right to work" bill originating in the Senate. He also supposedly has not read the House Bill and has not decided how to vote on it.

    Both have seemingly backed off their positions of filibustering the bill to saying they are now undecided.  Maybe feeling the heat might help them to see the light.

<p>*CORRECTION &amp; APOLOGY*<em> I am so sorry to you and to Senator Eric Schmitt for misrepresenting his position on HB466.&#160; Senator Schmitt&rsquo;s office tells me that he has no intention of filibustering this bill. He went on to say that he agrees in principle with the bill&rsquo;s intent and may actually support it, depending on the language.&#160; </em></p>
<p><em>Please accept my apology and help me make it right.&#160; Please call or write Senator Schmitt&rsquo;s office (below) and tell him Thank You.&#160; Thanks for letting HB466 come to a vote, thanks for remaining open to supporting the bill, and thanks for graciously accepting Hennessy&rsquo;s apology for jumping the gun.</em></p>
<p>**Original Story**</p>
<p>How would you feel if your employer took money from your paycheck and gave it to a candidate you despised or an issue you opposed?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c0504d;">I&rsquo;d be outraged if someone used my money for their political ends.</span></strong></p>
<p>The Missouri House is set to pass HB 466&mdash;a bill that would allow Missouri workers to decline participation in their unions&rsquo; political activities.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&#160; Currently, union workers are <em>required</em> to give their wages to candidates and causes they personally oppose.</p>
<p><span style="color:#c0504d;"><strong>HB 466 would right a terrible, un-America wrong. </strong></span></p>
<p>The problem is that two Republican Senators say they intend to filibuster the bill when it gets to the Senate.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to that a politician of <em>any party</em> would oppose your right to support the candidates and causes of your choice?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s help these two State Senators understand that we will not have our money pried from our wallets for causes we oppose.</p>
<p>Call or email these gentlemen RIGHT NOW and <em>politely</em> tell them: Do not filibuster or threaten to filibuster HB 466 in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#4f81bd;">Eric Schmitt</span></strong>: (573) 751-2853 <a href="mailto:eschmitt@senate.mo.gov">eschmitt@senate.mo.gov</a> *NOT FILIBUSTERING: See Top of Page*    <br /><strong><span style="color:#4f81bd;">Kevin Engler</span>:</strong> (573) 751-3455 <a href="mailto:kengler@senate.mo.gov">kengler@senate.mo.gov</a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c0504d;">5 Follow Ups:</span></strong></p>
<p>1.&#160; After you call or email, go to twitter and facebook and post, &ldquo;I asked #MO Senators Schmitt and Engler to let the senate decide HB466 <a title="http://bit.ly/g0zc9D" href="http://bit.ly/g0zc9D">http://bit.ly/g0zc9D</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&#160; Ask 5 friends to call, email, tweet, and post just like you did.</p>
<p>3.&#160; Come back to this page and comment on what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>4. If the Senators comply, support them.&#160; Send a thank you note via email, and this note on twitter and facebook: &ldquo;Thank you, Senator [name] for letting the Senate decide to protect #MO workers&rsquo; rights&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&#160; If either or both Senators continues to threaten to filibuster, stand by.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s not enough to criticize when a politician does wrong.&#160; We need to thank and support them when they do right.&#160; They are, after all, people.</p>
<p>*UPDATE* I heard that Sen. Schmitt's assistant seemed very surprised to hear about our concern.&#160; I'd love to announce that I was wrong about my concern, and I will if Senator Schmitt announces he has no intention of filibustering.</p>
