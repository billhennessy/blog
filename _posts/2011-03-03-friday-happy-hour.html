<p>Dana Loesch on facebook gave kudos to Missouri State Senators <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=830523218" target="_blank">Nieves</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1789213453" target="_blank">Lembke</a> for fighting a federal bribe to the states.&#160; </p>
<blockquote><p>Major props to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=830523218">Brian Nieves</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1789213453">Jim Lembke</a> for their continued commitment to conservatism in the MO Senate with HB 163 - refusing federal funds for another unemployment extension that costs taxpayers $81 million. They're standing their ground against some of their fellow GOP who need to be reminded what fiscal conservatism is. Bravo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I join Dana. For the second time this year, these two have stood guard against more federal borrowing against my kids.&#160; </p>
<p><strong><font color="#c0504d">ACTION:</font></strong></p>
<p>Please call or write the Senators to thank them for their principled courage.&#160; And if you don&rsquo;t have the good fortune of living in one of their districts, <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/llookup/leg_lookup.aspx" target="_blank">call or write your Senator</a> and asking him or her to join Nieves and Lembke in their fight against Washington bribes. </p>
<p>Senator Brian Nieves:&#160; (573) 751-3678 <a href="mailto:Brian.Nieves@senate.mo.gov">Brian.Nieves@senate.mo.gov</a></p>
