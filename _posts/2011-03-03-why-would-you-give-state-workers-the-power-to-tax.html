<p>For decades, now, public sector unions have imposed onerous tax increases and service cuts on the net tax payers of many states.&#160; Wisconsin being among the worst. </p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Look at what&rsquo;s going on in Wisconsin.&#160; The people who represent the net tax payers&mdash;those who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salary&mdash;are being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takers&mdash;those receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes.&#160; In fact, the net takers have shut down Wisconsin&rsquo; legislature with the help of 14 cowardly state senators.</p>
<p>What the Wisconsin unions want to keep is the power to impose any taxes they want on the people of Wisconsin through collective bargaining.&#160; That&rsquo;s right, state employee unions have the power to tax the people. </p>
<p>Suppose Wisconsin set a tax rate of 8 percent.&#160; Then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3mw49mk_x0" target="_blank">AFSCME (NSFW)</a> goes on strike demanding a 20 percent wage increase and a 5 percent workforce increase.&#160; To prevent chaos, the state grants the concession.&#160; Taxes must go up or non AFSCME services must go down.&#160; </p>
<p>But non-AFSCME services are likely covered under some other union&rsquo;s contract. So the state has to raise taxes now, or borrow money now and raise taxes later. </p>
<p>Either way, unelected union representatives have imposed a tax on the people. </p>
<p>Letting unions determine a state&rsquo;s tax policy is like letting a 16-year-old have a&#160; 12-pack of Budweiser and the car keys. </p>
