<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re not really inviting me to speak; they&rsquo;re inviting the thousands of St. Louis area activists who have done so much to advance liberty and defend freedom over the past 25 months. </p>
<p>Trent Humphries put out a request for speakers after the rogue <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/02/the-tuscon-tea-party-needs-your-help-local-authorities-trying-to-silence-them/" target="_blank">sheriff of Pima County began an intimidation campaign</a> against Tucson Tea Party speakers.&#160; <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> and 24th State&rsquo;s editor brought the incident to my attention, and I offered to speak.&#160; </p>
<p>I also emailed Pima County Sheriff, Clarence Dupnik, requesting his response to allegations of intimidation.&#160; Having received no answer in the month since the request, I am left assume that he does not deny the charges. </p>
<p>The Tucson Tea Party won&rsquo;t be silenced, and neither will we. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to Tucson April 29 and 30 thanks to the generosity of the Trent Humphries and Tucson Tea. I hope you will either join us a the tea party or<font color="#c0504d"> <a href="http://www.tucsonteaparty.org/" target="_blank">make a<font color="#c0504d"> donation</font> to the Tucson Tea Party</a></font> to help defray the costs of working around their sheriff&rsquo;s attempts to silence us. </p>
