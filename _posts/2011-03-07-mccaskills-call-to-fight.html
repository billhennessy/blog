    Claire chose to represent Barack Obama (who never lived in Missouri) instead of representing me (a native Missourian) when I asked her to do her job.  She repeated told me of her enthusiasm to work with the Obama administration, and she said nothing about addressing my concerns.

    I advised her to not seek re-election.  If Sarah and Ed need help in my area, I'll try to find some time to campaign.

<p>I&rsquo;m getting a lot of requests to pump news about Claire McCaskill&rsquo;s comments to Democrats. According to Brian R. Hook of Missouri Watchdog, <a href="http://missouri.watchdog.org/12482/mccaskill-to-democrats-its-time-for-us-to-fight/?utm_source=MO_Subscriptions&amp;utm_campaign=91a9ee8b21-Questionable_Welfare_Payments&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank">McCaskill gave Democrats a set of instructions</a> very similar to those I usually give at the end of Tea Party rallies.&#160; (Only Claire&rsquo;s instructions seem a bit less human than mine.)</p>
<p>Some national political scientists believe McCaskill&rsquo;s Senate seat is one of the most vulnerable in 2012.&#160; </p>
<p>Republicans Sarah Steelman and <a href="http://edmartinformissouri.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a> Jr., who came within an eyelash of upsetting Russ Carnahan in last year&rsquo;s race for Missouri&rsquo;s 3rd US Congressional District, have announced their candidacies for the right to oppose McCaskill.&#160; </p>
<p>A primary challenge for McCaskill is not out of the question, but no Democrats have offered to challenge McCaskill so far.</p>
