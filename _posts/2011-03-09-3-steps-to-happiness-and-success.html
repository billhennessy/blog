    innocuous actions or words have on others.

  content: Thank you.  In just a few moments, you've given me a reason to be thankful
    AND a reason to acknowledge my own kindness.  The former I find easy, but the
    latter is sometimes a struggle for angry, bitter, gun-toting clingers like me.

<p>Some of the biggest potholes on the road to happiness come from bad advice from self-help &ldquo;experts.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier.&#160; And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Give Thanks</strong></p>
<p>People who write down three things they&rsquo;re grateful for and the reason those things happened show a 50 percent drop in medical claims over six months compared to a control group who journaled about nothing in particular (Emmons &amp; McCullough).&#160; </p>
<p>So get a notebook and write down three things you&rsquo;re thankful for one day a week. If you&rsquo;re a digital type, then go to <a href="http://www.thankfulfor.com">www.thankfulfor.com</a>.&#160; There you can post (private or public) gratitudes.&#160; They even have an iPhone app to make giving thanks all the easier. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Record Your Acts of Kindness</strong></p>
<p>On another day of the week, write down two things you did for others out of kindness.&#160; Studies show that reflecting on your own good deeds will lower blood pressure and put you in a better mood.&#160; Plus, you&rsquo;ll start to look for opportunities to do little acts of kindness, even as simple as smiling at a stranger.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong><strong>Walk</strong></strong></p>
<p>A casual stroll of just 10 or 15 minutes can set you in a much better mood.&#160; Do this three days a week.&#160; </p>
<p>There.&#160; Three free, simple acts to make you happier, healthier, and more successful.&#160; </p>
