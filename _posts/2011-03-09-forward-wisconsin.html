<p>Doing the right thing is hard. </p>
<p>Doing the right thing after years of practicing the wrong things is even harder.</p>
<p><img style="display:inline;float:left;" align="left" src="http://angrywhitedude.com/wp-content/uploads2/2011/02/scott-walker.jpg" width="219" height="203" /> When your senate separated the fiscal responsibility provisions affecting union collective bargaining powers from a bill that previously included tax and spend provisions, you took a big step toward fiscal recovery.</p>
<p>For years, public sector unions have dictated states&rsquo; taxing spending policies through brute force.&#160; These unions were not elected by the people, but the people were forced to pay&mdash;or borrow&mdash;what the unions demanded. </p>
<p>Economically, public sector unions are not workers, but part of the of government.&#160; They are management.&#160; They imposed their demands directly on the people who pay the bill and who created their functions in the first place.&#160; </p>
<p>Unlike politicians, though, unions have refused to yield to the electoral process.</p>
<p>Your governor, Scott Walker, and your 18 Republican Senators displayed courage and decency throughout this ordeal, brought on by Democrats who shirked their duties by fleeing the state.&#160; You, the people of Wisconsin, show tremendous patience and courage, too, but standing behind your elected officials who are trying to govern. </p>
<p>When <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelreagan/2011/02/23/remember_patco" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan fired the illegally striking PATCO</a> workers, leftist pundits predicted mayhem.&#160; They were wrong.&#160; The skies remained as safe after as they&rsquo;d been before. Federal workers learned a new respect for the American taxpayer.&#160; And the US economy, eventually, healed into a nearly 20-year expansion.</p>
<p>You, Wisconsin, have set an example for us all.&#160; So I lift my glass and toast you with your governor&rsquo;s brother, Johnny. </p>
<p>Forward.</p>
