  content: I agree w/ you on this one, Bill!   Chip Wood is the ONLY guy to vote for
    if you want someone who will take care of the PEOPLE.    From a reliable source
    who attended the Democrat's nomination "party" for Chip's opponent,  I was told
    that when Mr. Zimmerman  got up to thank everyone, he said his first priority
    would be to meet with all the "stakeholders".  He went on to enumerate who those
    stakeholders were.....school superintendents, heads of police and fire districts,  city
    governments, etc.   I think that is a pretty telling statement.  So let me get
    this straight....Our elected assessor is supposed to work on behalf of home and
    business owners to provide a FAIR and ACCURATE valuation  of their property, right?   But
    Zimmerman thinks his FIRST priority is to the  taxing districts.    Hmmmm.......wonder
    why that might be?  Could it be that's where his state rep and assessor campaign
    contributions come from?    I guess he believes his job is to keep assessments
    at status quo so that the taxing bodies don't have to tighten their belts due
    to a drop in their revenue?  Gee, we lowly peons should be so lucky.   VOTE FOR
    CHIP....unless you want MORE OF THE SAME.

  content: I'll vote for L. K. Wood, even though I know him only as an very good real
    estate developer because no one can be worse than a Democrat aligned to Dooley,
    who is the most dishonest county supervisor I have seen in my many years.  Dooley
    would do well in Illinois, where the people apparently don't mind being swindled.

<p>Did you know that there&rsquo;s an election on April 5?&#160; And it&rsquo;s just as important an election as last November&rsquo;s historic election. </p>

<p>This time, you and I have the job to elect Chip Wood for County Assessor.   <br />Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>In 2010, voters created an elected assessor&rsquo;s office in St. Louis County.&#160; The Republicans pushed for this new office because of corruption, abuse, and waste in the County Assessor&rsquo;s office under Charlie Dooley.&#160; The GOP convinced voters that St. Louis County needed an assessor who was accountable, not to Dooley, but to the people.</p>
<p>And the GOP was right. </p>
<p>In the race for the new, elected assessor&rsquo;s office, Chip Wood is the only real choice.&#160; His opponent wants to stay the course, continuing the corruption fostered under Charlie Dooley.&#160; IN other words, the Democrat wants to use property tax assessments to fund the Democrat machine.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chipwoodforassessor.com/index1.html" target="_blank">Chip Wood</a> is different.&#160; He&rsquo;s a political outsider, running as a Republican, but with very little help from the state or county Republican party.&#160; Chip is life-long real estate expert who has a well crafted plan to re-engineer the County Assessors office, eliminating corruption and waste.&#160; Chip Wood will make a human being accountable to YOU for YOUR property tax bill. That&rsquo;s right-- Chip Wood will let you deal with a person with a name and face.&#160;&#160; His opponent wants you to argue with a computer. </p>
<p>Why is that so important?&#160; Because under Charlie Dooley&rsquo;s regime, St. Louis County has 3 to 5 times the number of property tax assessment complaints as most counties our size.&#160; That&rsquo;s because of the neglect, corruption, and lack of personal accountable in the assessor&rsquo;s office.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>On April 5, vote Chip Wood for St. Louis County Assessor. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Bill Hennessy, and&#160; no one authorized or approved this message but me. </p>
