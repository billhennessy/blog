    That was one of the more encouraging things I've heard in a long, long time.
    Especially how she closed, "...if I don't do that, then I don't deserve to have this job again in two years."

    I hope some folks in Jefferson City are reviewing that.

<p>Every senior generation decries the banal idiocy of its junior generations. Remember how critical Boomers were of Generation X?&#160; </p>
<p>Turns out Gen X was one of the most productive generations in a long while.&#160; Then Gen Y just went off and fought two wars for us. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.lifecourse.com/2010/12/millennials-in-office/" target="_blank">Historian Neil Howe</a> points us to today&rsquo;s Happy Hour:&#160; a Millennial elected to Michigan&rsquo;s state assembly last November.&#160; </p>

<p>As Howe points out: </p>
<blockquote><p>Many positive <a href="http://www.lifecourse.com/mi/insight/def/millennial-gen.html">Millennial</a> (born 1982-200?) traits (positive attitude, results-orientation, teamworking, close to family and community) are all reflected here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cheers</p>
