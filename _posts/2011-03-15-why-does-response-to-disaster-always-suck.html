  content: Completely agree with the comments here. I mean, Japan, COME ON. Your people
    are suffering, and it certainly seems like you're doing the bare minimum. I feel
    so sorry for the citizens!

    First responders generally perform well, but past that our expectations in a crisis

    we have to lower our expectations or look beyond politics for leadership. \n\nI

    emerged on the big stage, yet."

    I was so impressed with a rare video on http://www.torrentoff.com that I also
    donated not very big sum to this coutry! Hope, we will help Japan to renew after
    these awful events!"

<p>I just heard on BBC that the Japanese government is only now dealing with the Fukushami nuclear problem appropriately.&#160; </p>
<p><img src="http://media.katu.com/images/110312_nuclear_plant.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little surprised they responded this quickly.</p>

<li>FEMA took weeks to bring relief to South Carolina following Hurricane Hugo (but did much better following Andrew) </li>
</ol>
<p>Today&mdash;on the fifth day of crisis&mdash;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_japan_earthquake" target="_blank">Japanese utilities officials are still reluctant to ask for help</a>, according to the AP:</p>
<blockquote><p>Late Tuesday, officials at the plant said they were considering asking for help from the U.S. and Japanese militaries to spray water from helicopters into the pool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that foreign countries&mdash;away from the disaster scene&mdash;respond more appropriately to disasters than the affected countries do.&#160; But this time, even the US president seems too aloof to bother with Japan.&#160; In short, leaders just don&rsquo;t seem to lead in disasters.</p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Is it because leaders are afraid to appear frightened?&#160; Perhaps, but appearing indecisive seems even worse.</p>
<p>Is it because leaders overestimate their own country to deal with problems?&#160; Perhaps, but many of the slow responders are leaders, like Obama, who believe no one can do anything without government supervision.&#160; </p>
<p>Or is it because we have so many processes and procedures that we can&rsquo;t respond?&#160; </p>
<p>In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767900464/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464" target="_blank">The Fourth Turning</a></em>, the authors describe <a href="http://www.fourthturning.com/html/archetypes_3.html" target="_blank">Artist generations</a>&mdash;particularly the Artists who comprise America&rsquo;s Silent Generation&mdash;as process gurus who prefer following a defined process to producing good results. (<a href="http://hennessysview.com/latest/dont-look-for-quick-fixes/" target="_blank">Previous post</a>.) The Carter administration was pack with Silent Generation.&#160; So was George H. W. Bush&rsquo;s.&#160; Reagan preferred GI Generation, Clinton Silent and Boomer.&#160; </p>
<p>If the authors are right, most of our institutions and agencies are saddled with 25 years of Silent Generation executive paperwork and process.&#160; That would apply to every country involved in World War II, including, of course, Japan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of process. That&rsquo;s a lot of forms.&#160; That&rsquo;s a lot of red tape to cut through before grabbing the fire extinguisher and dowsing the flames.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fourthturning.com/html/archetypes_1.html" target="_blank">Generation X</a> is sometimes too quick to act. Fair point.&#160; But when hell breaks loose it&rsquo;s no time to fill out the right forms.&#160; It&rsquo;s time to by God act.</p>
