  content: "Did you know Zimmerman is trying to smear Wood w/ claims that he got sued
    by the county for not paying his personal property taxes?  Here's the real story,
    straight from Wood's mouth.  He moved his business office from the county into
    the city.  The  bill for personal property never reached his new address, so he
    unwittingly did not pay it, because he never received it!  Keep in mind his much
    larger, real estate tax bill, DID get paid.   So then the county sent a notice
    of late payment to Wood, who responded by immediately paying his now overdue personal
    property taxes, along w/ the penalty.   Trouble is, the county's law dept. never
    \ got word from the revenue folks that the bill had been paid, so legal sent out
    a notice of suit.  Wood then called the county legal beagles, who quickly figured
    out the mistake, and sent Wood a letter of apology.   So, do you think  Zimmerman
    will do his homework adequately when doing your assessment?   I don't think so!
    \  Never mind the typical, slimy maneuver he tried to use.....it just screams
    of being a typical POLITICIAN.   Everyone who was against the elected assessor
    said they didn't want the position \"politicized\" by having an election.  Well,
    guess who has now politicized it?   Zimmerman!  What a slimebag.\n\n"

<p>That&rsquo;s St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that corruption, nepotism, and Machiavellian favoritism runs rampant in St. Louis County.&#160; What&rsquo;s worse is that Dooley doesn&rsquo;t seem to care what anyone thinks.</p>
<blockquote><p>St. Louis County in the third year of a hiring and pay freeze, Mike Temporiti landed a $70,000 county job.</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>The job was never posted, and Temporiti did not have to interview for it.</p>
<p>He is a lawyer and the son of John Temporiti, who is County Executive Charlie A. Dooley's longtime campaign treasurer and manager and former chief of staff.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Enough? There&rsquo;s more. With Dooley, there&rsquo;s always more.</p>
<p>John Temporiti&rsquo;s daughter is also a County employee, and Temporiti has a history of confronting people who don&rsquo;t do as he says.&#160; </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably not much we can do right now about Dooley&rsquo;s corruption and the <a href="http://www.24thstate.com/2011/03/mike-temporitis-job-qaulifications-nepotism-and-patronage.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+24thstate+%2824thstate%29" target="_blank">Temporiti&rsquo;s rather unique employment agency</a> at 41 South Central in Clayton. But we can slow down Dooley&rsquo;s corruption machine on April 5.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s date Dooley hopes to coronate yet another political hack, Jake Zimmerman, as County Assessor.&#160; </p>
<p>You have the chance to upend the Dooley Regime by electing L. K. &ldquo;Chip&rdquo; Wood&#160; as County Assessor.&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chipwoodforassessor.com/index1.html" target="_blank">Chip Wood</a> is an outstanding candidate whose entire life has revolved around real estate and property.&#160; While Zimmerman has promised to make you talk to a computer if you don&rsquo;t like your assessment, Wood will let you deal with a human being who is personally responsible for your case. </p>
<p>In fact, everything about Dooley screams &ldquo;machine.&rdquo;&#160; The alternative is human, and the very personable Chip Wood.&#160; </p>
<p>You can trust Chip to keep assessments fair.</p>
