<p>What many people don't get is that cooperation is not the same as consensus.&#160;&#160; </p>

<p>Cooperation means someone takes the lead on an issue. If it makes sense, and if the leader is perceived to have good character and judgment, others follow.&#160; Otherwise, the project is stillborn.&#160; It's the way the market picks leaders.&#160; Not through org charts, but through action and response. </p>
<p>One person may be the leader on one issue and a cooperator on many others.&#160; Most people play both roles frequently. </p>
<p>Consensus, on the other hand, is the absence of leadership.&#160; </p>
