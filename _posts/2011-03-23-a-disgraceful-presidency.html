<p>Historians will mark March 19 as the day the Obama presidency reached its point of no return. </p>
<p><img style="display:inline;float:left;" title="Obama Toasts His War in Rio" alt="Obama Toasts His War in Rio" align="left" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/22/article-1368693-0B47049F00000578-447_470x423.jpg" width="290" height="261" /></p>
<p>The image of a cowardly and selfish child-president flying to Brazil to launch a war will haunt his legacy, like Nixon&rsquo;s vulgarities on tape in 1974. Obama&rsquo;s war on Libya has doomed an already weak administration. </p>
<p>Today, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1368693/Libya-war-Germans-pull-forces-NATO-Libyan-coalition-falls-apart.html" target="_blank">Germany pulled out of NATO</a> because of the bungled, late, and idiotic intervention.&#160; It appears, now, that the alliance that won the Cold War and help sustain two decades of peace could collapse under a lack of American leadership.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Obamas cut short their South American vacation, returning early to Washington. Obama is now scrambling to rescue, not only his presidency, but whatever prestige America might have left.&#160; </p>
<p>From his obsequious bows to foreign leaders to his denunciations of the USA in foreign and enemy lands, Mr. Obama seemed, for a time, bent on knee-capping American influence around the world.&#160; Having succeeded in damaging our world image, he now wonders why things are so chaotic and dangerous.</p>
<p>A combination of weak decisions &ndash; or no decisions &ndash; set up what seems to be a no-win situation for Obama, NATO, and the US, not to mention Qaddafi&rsquo;s internal foes. </p>
<p>First, Obama vacillated for weeks about what to do. Instead of using the time to consult Congress and request authorization to use force&mdash;as George W. Bush had done repeatedly&mdash;Obama filled out basketball brackets.&#160; And that lost time was crucial.</p>
<p>Second, Qaddafi used Obama&rsquo;s delays to counterattack the rebels. Two weeks ago, rebels controlled all but Tripoli. By the time Obama acted, rebels were under siege in their final bastion of Benghazi.&#160; </p>
<p>Third, Obama has ruled out both the use of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110323/ap_on_re_us/us_us_libya_32" target="_blank">ground troops in Libya</a> and <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/it-will-be-unwise-for-allied-forces-to-try-to-kill-gaddafi-gates_100516495.html" target="_blank">targeting Qaddafi</a>. This combination has frustrated our friends and reassured our foes.&#160; It makes a long stalemate likely, increases the probability of mass starvation and continued death and misery for the innocents.&#160; </p>
<p>Yesterday, when asked how long a no-fly zone might last in Libya, a British Member of Parliament told BBC news, &ldquo;the no-fly zone over Iraq lasted the better part of a decade.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>History shows that standoffs like the one facing us in Libya hurt the people in the country the most. There are often food shortages, as happened in Iraq and <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-20/news/mn-3946_1_rural-areas" target="_blank">in Haiti</a>, as dictators seize food supplies for themselves and their supporters.&#160; There are often massacres that escape the watchful eye of the UN and NATO, as happened throughout the Iraq no-fly zone period.&#160; And there is corruption, as (French) companies and politicians <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16142-2004Oct7.html" target="_blank">exploit embargos and sanctions</a> to demand black market prices of both dictators and the oppressed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/2011/03/20/5-questions-about-libya/" target="_blank">important questions about Obama&rsquo;s odd foreign policy</a> remain unanswered. </p>
<p>During the 2008 campaign, everyone from Hillary Clinton to Rush Limbaugh and Rudy Giuliani warned voters to avoid inexperienced and weak candidates like Obama.&#160; But we elected him anyway.&#160; </p>
<p>The chickens are coming home to roost. </p>
