  content: Bill, I have to admit I've been swayed by the 'news' reports on Mr. Wood
    owing back taxes.  Help pull me back from the abyss - what are the real facts
    of this situation?  I don't want to raise up conservative candidates that turn
    out to be no better morally than their Dem opponents.

<p>You can <a href="https://post.cfinc.com/cgi-bin/WebPay.cgi?formid=B625D7CADABCC86961406FD5F865A5DB7CB506039D10CD91&amp;sessionid=BD71EFABE711170B" target="_blank">help get these TV ads on the air</a>.&#160;&#160; I will tell you how shortly.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t in live in St. Louis County? You still have a horse in this race.&#160; I&rsquo;ll tell you why after you watch this commercial.</p>
<div style="display:inline;float:none;margin:0;padding:0;" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:31f20c13-9a5b-464d-b02f-3a031a93c194" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">

<div style="width:448px;clear:both;font-size:.8em;">Vote L. K. Wood, as everyone should, on April 5</div>
</div>
<p>Why should you care about this race if you don&rsquo;t live in St. Louis County?&#160; </p>
<p>Because Chip&rsquo;s opponent is a Harvard lawyer who&rsquo;s being groomed for much bigger things. When a conservative emerges as a fast charger, the left does everything in its power&mdash;right or wrong&mdash;to destroy that person. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to resort to the left&rsquo;s unsavory tactics.&#160; We can simply win this race. </p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve seen, L.K. &ldquo;Chip&rdquo; Wood is an experienced real estate man, dedicated to running the assessor&rsquo;s office right.&#160; His opponent is a career politician determined to protect County Boss Charlie Dooley, before moving on to damage America in higher offices.&#160; </p>
