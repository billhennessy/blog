  content: "Well put indeed.\n\nPerhaps not so well put, I heard Claire on the radio
    this morning, and one of the things she blurted out when spluttering about how
    difficult this mess has made her life, was something along the lines of \n\n<i>&ldquo;...if
    we&rsquo;d only registered the plane in [some other state, I don&rsquo;t recall
    which], we wouldn&rsquo;t have had this problem at all...&rdquo;</i>\n\nThat&rsquo;s
    a convenient escape for someone with the wealth and ability to pick and choose
    which state she&rsquo;ll register her luxury item in... but I wonder if she&rsquo;s
    bothered to think through that line of thought when she&rsquo;s considering promoting
    and imposing her thousand page laws upon the entire nation.\n\nClaire? Dear? Where
    will people go to escape such penalties, not just on luxury items, but upon their
    daily needs and routines, when you&rsquo;ve imposed even more burdensome taxes
    and regulations upon the entire nation?\n\nHmmm?\n\nErrClaire in 2012"

<p>On Monday, we learned that US Senator Claire McCaskill failed to pay property taxes on her personal luxury jet for three years.&#160; Previously, she had <a href="http://sayanythingblog.com/entry/sen-claire-mccaskill-d-ipwad-finally-pays-taxes-on-her-private-plane/" target="_blank">charged taxpayers</a> some of the cost of operating her private plane. Before that, it seems, she registered the plane in property tax-free <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/03/good-grief-air-claire-registered-her-plane-in-delaware-to-avoid-paying-taxes-before-she-moved-it-to-missouri-where-she-didnt-pay-taxes/" target="_blank">Delaware</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>On Monday, Claire wrote a $287,000 check without batting an eye. Now, St. Louis County says she owes them another <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-fix/article_bca2eed2-5570-11e0-9a25-0017a4a78c22.html" target="_blank">$33,000 in interest and penalties</a>, for a total bill of $320,000.&#160; </p>

<p>By keeping his business open, he will pay the city every penny it&rsquo;s owed. And the depopulating city of St. Louis is spared yet another empty storefront. </p>
<p>Not only is this a difference in degree, it&rsquo;s a difference in kind.&#160; The difference here is not so obvious, but it is profound: </p>
<ul>
<li>Chip Wood made a difficult economic choice to try to save his business and pay his people with every intention of making the city whole </li>
<li>Claire McCaskill hired a team of accountants and lawyers to shield her from every possible tax, and amidst their dodging, dipping, diving, ducking, and dodging they dropped a $287,000 property tax bill.&#160; Oops!</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all tax stories are equal. I trust that reasonable people realize that a businessman fighting to keep his doors open and his employees employed&#160; is different from a millionaire fighting to fly her luxury jet for free. </p>
<p>P.S.&#160; On April 5, I will L. K. Wood, as everyone should, for County Assessor. He&rsquo;s the only qualified person in the race. </p>
