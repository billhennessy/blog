<p>The Post-Dispatch says the County Assessor should be a political operative, not an expert in real estate values like L. K. &ldquo;Chip&rdquo; Wood. I disagree, and this story explains why Charlie Dooley&rsquo;s regime needs fewer political hacks and more competent professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Troubling Questions for Zimmerman&rsquo;s Assessor Campaign:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why did the Zimmerman campaign take screen shots of Zimmerman&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s real estate values on January 13, 2011, the day he was selected?</li>
<li>Why did the Zimmerman campaign try to deny Stu Zimmerman&rsquo;s property tax cut by forwarding those old shots?</li>
<li>Why did someone update property tax records on March 25, the day after questions about favoritism first appeared?</li>
</ul>
<p>On March 24,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.24thstate.com/2011/03/breaking-jake-zimmerman-father-drop-in-house-assessment.html" target="_blank">24th State blog broke the story</a>:&nbsp; Stu Zimmerman received a significant reduction in his home&rsquo;s assessed value in 2011.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned since that the Zimmerman campaign produced documents from January 13&mdash;the day Jake Zimmerman was selected by the county Democrat Central Committee as their nominee for assessor.&nbsp; These document show that the 2011 assessment wasn&rsquo;t out yet.</p>
<p>That might have been true on January 13.&nbsp; The question is, did Stu Zimmerman receive a significantly larger property tax break than his neighbors? Well, Zimmerman&rsquo;s response didn&rsquo;t answer that question, but seems to have been an attempt discredit 24th State&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>In reality, Stu got 16.6 percent off his assessment while his neighbors in comparable homes ranged from 2-4 percent reductions to 2 to 4 percent increases in assessed values.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the screen shots provided by the Zimmerman campaign on Friday, March 25:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screen shot taken March 25 about 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s a screenshot taken on March 24:</p>

<p>Clearly, the Zimmerman campaign is trying to hide the dropped assessment for candidate Jake&rsquo;s dad. The question is &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
