<p>Jake Zimmerman&rsquo;s campaign rotates two themes:</p>
<p>1.&#160; The St. Louis County Assessor should be a career political hack, not a seasoned real estate professional</p>
<p>2. His little old friend, Margaret, is in danger of losing her home. </p>
<p>But mostly St. Louis County government needs more Democrat political hacks. </p>
<p>Turns out that, just like Jake&rsquo;s dad, his friend Margaret, a rather unsuccessful real estate investor, got a break on her property taxes.&#160; Well, on her investment property, anyway. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe anyone would vote for this guy.</p>
