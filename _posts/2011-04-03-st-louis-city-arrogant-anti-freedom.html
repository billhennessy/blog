<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m ashamed and embarrassed at my roots.&#160; See, I graduated from the same Catholic grade school as St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay.&#160; I shouldn&rsquo;t be embarrassed, I know. But how else do I react to stories like <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-st-louis-a-protest-sign-meets-government-arrogance/2011/04/01/AFvR4wJC_story.html" target="_blank">this one from George Will</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PzC40zTIj2A/S7N35GQXOUI/AAAAAAAAAG4/wLnIPDtaFAA/s1600/End+Eminent+Domain+Abuse+Mural+KMOX+image.jpg" /></p>
<p>It seems that Mayor Slay&rsquo;s administration is busy trampling all over the rights of a citizen, Jim Roos. </p>
<p>Roos painted a sign on a building he owns that days &ldquo;End Eminent Domain Abuse.&rdquo;&#160; Since that message runs counter to Slay&rsquo;s policy of abusing eminent domain&mdash;and the First Amendment&mdash;the city ordered Roos to paint over the sign after denying him a permit. </p>
<p>The City prevailed in a <a href="http://ownerscounsel.blogspot.com/2010/03/judge-ruled-anti-eminent-domain-mural.html" target="_blank">federal court</a>. In his ruling, the US District Judge Henry Autrey ruled, effectively, that political speech is unprotected if it contains a phone number for more information. </p>
<p>Will nails the problem with Slay, many judges, and government itself:</p>
<p>St. Louis is not the problem; government is. Many people go into it because they enjoy bossing people around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason for the Tea Party in a nutshell.&#160; People go into government solely to boss other people around. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s end eminent domain abuse. Let&rsquo;s also end the Democrat&rsquo;s multi-generational stranglehold on liberty in St. Louis City. </p>
<p>People of St. Louis&rsquo;s 10th Aldermanic Ward can begin this correction by <a href="http://www.irwinforalderman.com/" target="_blank">electing Jesse Irwin</a> on Tuesday,&#160; April 5.&#160;</p>
