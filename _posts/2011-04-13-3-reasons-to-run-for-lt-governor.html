<p>Patrick Tuohey made some good points about <a href="http://www.missourirecord.com/blog/index.asp?blog=548" target="_blank">the office of Lieutenant Governor</a>.&nbsp; Based on that, I thought up all the possible reasons someone would run for LooeyG.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Stepping Stone:&nbsp; Establish state-wide name recognition and give yourself plenty of time to run for that <em>next</em> office, like U.S. Senate or Governor.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Party Reptile:&nbsp; If the governor is or is likely to be of the opposite party, you get to be the de facto head of your party in the state.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Caretaker: After a long and successful political career, you&rsquo;re ready for a slower pace. But you want to continue to serve, to be ready in case you&rsquo;re needed.</p>
<p>Without casting aspersions&nbsp; on the current or past Lieutenant Governors of Missouri, it&rsquo;s worth asking LooeyG candidates why they want <em>that</em> office.&nbsp; And it would be nice to get an honest response.</p>
<p>If a candidate&rsquo;s reason is reason 1, you can bet that paving the way for the next office is already more important to him than the job he&rsquo;s got.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; There might be one more, fun reason to run . . . but <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a whole different column.</p>
