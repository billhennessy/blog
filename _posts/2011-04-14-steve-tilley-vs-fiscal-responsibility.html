    Key word for progressives this season, the fashionable phrase: to be "held hostage".
    Oh those vicious conservatives. How criminal!

<p><img style="display: inline; float: left;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EC3JBiX8Ibg/TYAWKC3xc_I/AAAAAAAAHSo/N9AwvqhzFYU/s1600/Steve%2BTilley.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="287" align="left" />When John McCain (R-AZ) and Roy Blunt (R-MO) agree with Michele Bachmann and Rush Limbaugh, you can bet the issue is beyond debate.</p>
<p>In this case, the issue is the massive U.S. debt and what that debt is about to do to America.</p>
<p>McCain compared the <a href="http://cnsnews.com/node/84016#comment-183699032" target="_blank">U.S. situation to Greece and Spain</a>, saying we should prepare for a &ldquo;fiscal meltdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy Blunt, meanwhile, said raising the debt ceiling without hard measures to cut spending would be &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pulaskicountydaily.com/news.php?viewStory=2633" target="_blank">simply reckless</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Has Missouri <a href="http://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2011/04/fighting-on-for-tea-party-principles.html" target="_blank">House Speaker Steve Tilley</a> gotten the message?&nbsp; Apparently not.</p>
<p>Tilley is threatening to knee-cap <a href="http://hennessysview.com/limited-government/thank-a-senator/" target="_blank">the spending deal struck by Missouri Senators</a> Lembke, Nieves, Schaaf, and Kraus designed to wean Missouri off Washington&rsquo;s teat.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://blogs.news-leader.com/mopolitics/2011/04/11/senate-passes-new-unemployment-benefits-bill-tilley-responds/" target="_blank">News-Leader.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And Tilley said the House won&rsquo;t put too much weight on what he believes the Senate wants him to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be held hostage by a few people,&rdquo; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course not.&nbsp; Not unless the hostage takers are billionaires.</p>
