    OOPS. But Tilly is in the majority.
    How about that!
    Some just can't let go of the left hand that holds them.

  content: It looks like Steve Tilley sells his soul pretty cheaply. He took 200,000
    from Rex Singfeld and then supported local control. Now he wants to basically
    eliminate the electoral college. The country is based on a Representative Republic
    not mob rule. The electoral college works because without it the smaller states
    would have no representation. On the National level in the Senate they want to
    do away with going through the confirmation hearings on the Presidents nominees
    for certain positions. They want to streamline Government. What are these Republicans
    thinking???

  content: "Most people wrongly believe the presidential election system we have today
    is in the Constitution, and think that any change would need an amendment.  But
    state-by-state winner-take-all laws to award electoral college votes, are an example
    of state laws eventually enacted by states, using their exclusive power to do
    so, AFTER the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, Now our current system
    can be changed by state laws again.\n\nUnable to agree on any particular method,
    the Founding Fathers left the choice of method for selecting presidential electors
    exclusively to the states by adopting the language contained in section 1 of Article
    II of the U.S. Constitution &mdash; \"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner
    as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors . . .\"   The U.S.
    Supreme Court has repeatedly characterized the authority of the state legislatures
    over the manner of awarding their electoral votes as \"plenary\" and \"exclusive.\"\n\nThe
    constitution does not prohibit any of the methods that were debated and rejected.
    \ Indeed, a majority of the states appointed their presidential electors using
    two of the rejected methods in the nation&rsquo;s first presidential election
    in 1789 (i.e., appointment by the legislature and by the governor and his cabinet).
    \ Presidential electors were appointed by state legislatures for almost a century.
    \n\nNeither of the two most important features of the current system of electing
    the President (namely, universal suffrage, and the 48 state-by-state winner-take-all
    method) are in the U.S. Constitution. Neither was the choice of the Founders when
    they went back to their states to organize the nation's first presidential election.
    \ \n\nIn 1789, in the nation's first election, the people had no vote for President
    in most states, only men who owned a substantial amount of property could vote,
    and only three states used the state-by-state winner-take-all method to award
    electoral votes.\n\nThe winner-take-all method is not entitled to any special
    deference based on history or the historical meaning of the words in the U.S.
    Constitution.  The current 48 state-by-state winner-take-all method (i.e., awarding
    all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who receives the most popular
    votes in a particular state) is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, the debates
    of the Constitutional Convention, or the Federalist Papers.  The actions taken
    by the Founding Fathers make it clear that they never gave their imprimatur to
    the winner-take-all method.  \n\nThe constitutional wording does not encourage,
    discourage, require, or prohibit the use of any particular method for awarding
    the state's electoral votes. \n\nAs a result of changes in state laws enacted
    since 1789, the people have the right to vote for presidential electors in 100%
    of the states, there are no property requirements for voting in any state, and
    the state-by-state winner-take-all method is used by 48 of the 50 states. States
    can, and frequently have, changed their method of awarding electoral votes over
    the years. Maine and Nebraska currently award electoral votes by congressional
    district -- a reminder that an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is not required
    to change the way the President is elected.\n\t\nThe normal process of effecting
    change in the method of electing the President is specified in the U.S. Constitution,
    namely action by the state legislatures. This is how the current system was created,
    and this is the built-in method that the Constitution provides for making changes.

  content: "National Popular Vote has nothing to do with whether the country has a
    \"republican\" form of government or is a \"democracy.\" \n\nA \"republican\"
    form of government means that the voters do not make laws themselves but, instead,
    delegate the job to periodically elected officials (Congressmen, Senators, and
    the President). The United States has a \"republican\" form of government regardless
    of whether popular votes for presidential electors are tallied at the state-level
    (as has been the case in 48 states) or at district-level (as has been the case
    in Maine and Nebraska) or at 50-state-level (as under the National Popular Vote
    bill). \n\t\nIf a \"republican\" form of government means that the presidential
    electors exercise independent judgment (like the College of Cardinals that elects
    the Pope), we have had a \"democratic\" method of electing presidential electors
    since 1796 (the first contested presidential election). Ever since 1796, presidential
    candidates have been nominated by a central authority (originally congressional
    caucuses, and now party conventions) and electors are reliable rubberstamps for
    the voters of the district or state that elected them.\n"

  content: "The small states are the most disadvantaged group of states under the
    current system of electing the President. Political clout comes from being a closely
    divided battleground state, not the two-vote bonus.  The reason for this is the
    state-by-state winner-take-all method (not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution,
    but enacted by 48 states), under which all of a state's electoral votes are awarded
    to the candidate who gets the most votes in each separate state. \n\n\nNone of
    the 10 most rural states (VT, ME, WV, MS, SD, AR, MT, ND, AL, and KY) is a battleground
    state. \nThe current state-by-state winner-take-all method of awarding electoral
    votes does not enhance the influence of rural states, because the most rural states
    are not battleground states.\n\n12 of the 13 lowest population states (3-4 electoral
    votes) are almost invariably non-competitive, and ignored, in presidential elections.
    \ Six regularly vote Republican (Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota,
    and South Dakota),, and six regularly vote Democratic (Rhode Island, Delaware,
    Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, and DC) in presidential elections\nDespite the fact that
    these 12 lowest population states together possess 40 electoral votes, because
    they are not closely divided battleground states, none of these 12 states get
    visits, advertising or polling or policy considerations by presidential candidates.\n\n\nThe
    concept of a national popular vote for President is far from being politically
    \"radioactive\" in small states, because the small states recognize they are the
    most disadvantaged group of states under the current system.  \n\nIn the 13 lowest
    population states, the National Popular Vote bill already has been approved by
    nine state legislative chambers, including one house in, Delaware, the District
    of Columbia, and Maine and both houses in Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  It
    has been enacted by the District of Columbia and Hawaii.  \n"

  content: "The National Popular Vote bill would take effect when enacted by states
    that have a majority of the electoral votes--that is, enough electoral votes to
    elect a President (270 of 538). Then, all the electoral votes from those states
    would be awarded to the presidential candidate who receives the most popular votes
    in all 50 states (and DC). The bill would thus guarantee the Presidency to the
    candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District
    of Columbia.\n\nIn Gallup polls since 1944, only about 20% of the public has supported
    the current system of awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the presidential
    candidate who receives the most votes in each separate state (with about 70% opposed
    and about 10% undecided). The recent Washington Post, Kaiser Family Foundation,
    and Harvard University poll shows 72% support for direct nationwide election of
    the President. Support for a national popular vote is strong in virtually every
    state, partisan, and demographic group surveyed in recent polls in closely divided
    battleground states: Colorado-- 68%, Florida &ndash; 78%,  Iowa --75%, Michigan--
    73%, Missouri-- 70%, New Hampshire-- 69%, Nevada-- 72%, New Mexico-- 76%, North
    Carolina-- 74%, Ohio-- 70%, Pennsylvania -- 78%, Virginia -- 74%, and Wisconsin
    -- 71%; in smaller states (3 to 5 electoral votes): Alaska -- 70%, DC -- 76%,
    Delaware --75%, Idaho &ndash; 77%, Maine -- 77%, Montana &ndash; 72%,  Nebraska
    -- 74%, New Hampshire --69%, Nevada -- 72%, New Mexico -- 76%, Oklahoma &ndash;
    81%, Rhode Island -- 74%,  South Dakota &ndash; 71%, Utah - 70%, Vermont -- 75%,
    and West Virginia &ndash; 81%,  and Wyoming &ndash; 69%;  in Southern and border
    states: Arkansas --80%, Kentucky -- 80%, Mississippi --77%, Missouri -- 70%, North
    Carolina -- 74%, Oklahoma &ndash; 81%, South Carolina &ndash; 71%,  Virginia --
    74%, and West Virginia &ndash; 81%; and in other states polled: California --
    70%, Connecticut -- 74%,, Massachusetts -- 73%, Minnesota -- 75%, New York --
    79%, Oregon &ndash; 76%, and Washington -- 77%.\n\nThe National Popular Vote bill
    has passed 31 state legislative chambers, in 21 small, medium-small, medium, and
    large population states, including one house in Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware,
    The District of Columbia, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North
    Carolina, and Oregon, and both houses in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois,
    New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The
    bill has been enacted by the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey,
    Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington. These seven states have 74 electoral
    votes -- 27% of the 270 necessary to bring the law into effect.\n\nSee http://www.NationalPopularVote.com

<p>And, he&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley (R-Perryville) has signed onto legislation designed to <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills111/biltxt/intro/HB0974I.HTM" target="_blank">circumvent the Electoral College</a> in presidential elections. Like his position on <a href="http://jasonrosenbaum.typepad.com/capitol_calling/2009/10/tilley-expresses-support-for-embryonic-stem-cell-research.html" target="_blank">embryonic stem cell research</a> and the national debt, Tilley seems far out of step with Missouri&rsquo;s Republican base on this. And this guy wants to be Lt. Governor?&nbsp; <a href="http://hennessysview.com/missouri-2/3-reasons-to-run-for-lt-governor/" target="_blank">Please</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This might be old news to some.</strong></p>
<p>I see that Big Government&rsquo;s Josie Wales blogged about the national effort last August. But this is the first I heard of it in Missouri, and the first I&rsquo;d heard that Tilley&rsquo;s a co-sponsor (h/t Caroline Mueller). As Josie said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the progressive-statist plan to eliminate the electoral college, a state&rsquo;s popular will would be rejected for the national will.&nbsp; I cannot think of anything more un-democratic than changing someone&rsquo;s vote without his consent!&nbsp; <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/07/democrats_seek_to_change_rules.html">But this is the plan states like Masachusetts now encourage</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake: on this issue, <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/07/democrats_seek_to_change_rules.html" target="_blank">Tilley sides with the hardest of the hard left</a>.</p>
<p>The movement&rsquo;s goal is to get states to require Electors to vote according to the national popular vote instead of the according to the way residents of a state vote.</p>
<p>For example, in 2008, Missouri&rsquo;s 11 Electors voted for John McCain and Sarah Palin because they won the majority of votes in the state.&nbsp; Under HB974, which Tilley co-sponsored, those votes would have gone to Barack Obama because Obama won the popular vote.</p>
<p>If the law passed in all 50 states, the electoral college would always be a unanimous vote for the popular vote winner, making the body meaningless.</p>
<p><strong>Direct democracy fails. </strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution guarantees every state a republican form of government.&nbsp; And as conservative activist Caroline Mueller pointed out privately, if we&rsquo;re going to do away with the Electoral College, the way to do it is through a Constitutional Amendment, not legislative slight-of-hand. (Caroline says she opposes such an amendment, btw.)</p>
<p><strong>But let&rsquo;s not do it at all. </strong></p>
<p>Luckily, conservative floor leader Tim Jones (R-Ballwin) and other conservatives in the House will fight against this measure to make Missouri&rsquo;s electoral votes meaningless.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/jefferson-city-2/steve-tilley-vs-fiscal-responsibility/" target="_blank">Team Tilley strikes out again</a>.</p>
