  content: As a graduate of UMKC, (2 degrees) I'm angered that this is associated
    with the university system.  I've sent donations to the university to support
    the students and programs.  Until this is resolved, I will no longer send my money
    to the university.

<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask you to melt phones in Jefferson City, UMSL, UMKC, and Mizzou.&#160; I&rsquo;m asking you to do this today and tomorrow. I&rsquo;m following up with an email to you.</p>

<p><strong>Jay Nixon just asked the legislature to transfer $400 million</strong> from the taxpayers to the University of Missouri System.&#160; Unless the Governor or the Legislature acts at your request, <strong>some of that money will go to put you out of work</strong>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right: proud communists want to destroy the system that creates the wealth that funds the University of Missouri system.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t stop at wishing; <strong>they teach the students how to do it</strong>.</p>
<p>And <strong>Don Giljum, a communist union guy, encourages students to use violence to bring about his Marxist fantasy</strong>.</p>
<p>Read these stories:</p>

<p>3.&#160; <a href="http://hennessysview.com/missouri-2/shut-down-labor-studies-now-governor-nixon/" target="_blank"><strong>An Open Letter to Jay Nixon</strong></a></p>
<p>Giljum was brought in by Judy Ancel, vocal opponent of Right to Work in Missouri.&#160; Ancel was caught on tape telling students how to crash the electrical grid by electrocuting cats.&#160; <strong>Yes, cats, for all you Prop B fanatics out there</strong>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
