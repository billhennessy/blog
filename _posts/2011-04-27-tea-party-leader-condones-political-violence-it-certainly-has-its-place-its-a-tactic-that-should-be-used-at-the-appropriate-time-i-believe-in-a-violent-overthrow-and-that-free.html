<p>Did I say &ldquo;Tea Party Leader?&rdquo; <strong> I meant labor <em>union leader</em> Don Giljum condones violence, intimidation, and sabotage.</strong> Giljum&rsquo;s the business manager for Operating Engineers Local 148 and a lecturer at University of Missouri-St. Louis. It&rsquo;s in the UMSL classroom that he pontificates and brags about the&#160; . . . the uglier side of negotiations.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what he actually said about violence for political purposes: </p>
<blockquote><p>   It certainly has its place. It&rsquo;s a tactic that should be used at the appropriate time.&#160; I believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois, and that freedom is found at the barrel of a gun </p></blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>The Don Giljum Story</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not all Giljum said.&#160; When union guys warn about a problem but their managers don&rsquo;t react the way the want them to, Giljum helps the union guys &ldquo;make&rdquo; the bad thing happen. Like that guy in 1993 floods who &ldquo;made&rdquo; the dike break after the Army Corps of Engineers dismissed his prediction that it would break.&#160; That kind of thing. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/04/25/how-to-college-course-on-violent-union-tactics-part-ii-case-studies-edition/#more-260568" target="_blank">technical term is &ldquo;sabotage.&rdquo;</a>&#160; </p>
<p>Only Giljum&rsquo;s guys work for Ameren.&#160; You know, they people who run <a href="http://rockinconservative.com/2011/04/27/a-communist-saboteur-at-a-nuclear-power-plant/" target="_blank">the nuclear plant in Callaway County, Missouri</a>. Actually, Giljum&rsquo;s people run it; Ameren just owns it. </p>
<p>Maybe guys who like to use sabotage to get their way shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with nuclear power plants.&#160; You think? </p>

<p>Oh, and Giljum likes to use intimidation and threats.&#160; He had some big guys stalk an executive, he tells students in a class funded by Missouri and US taxpayers. These goons did such a good job of stalking this guy that the guy started wearing body armor. </p>
<p>Is that a riot or what?&#160; Probably took a few years off the guy&rsquo;s life, too, and made his family miserable. But, so what?&#160; All in a day&rsquo;s work at the Local 148, right? </p>
<p><strong>You Did Great Today</strong></p>
<p>I heard from witnesses that Gov. Nixon&rsquo;s phone rang incessantly today. Good. Tomorrow too, we hope.&#160; Nixon had to change <em>his</em> schedule today to avoid questions about Giljum, Ancel, and U of M&rsquo;s $416 million in taxpayer funding.&#160; </p>
<p>If you agree with Giljum&rsquo;s tactics and Jay Nixon&rsquo;s tolerance of threats, violence, and sabotage, do nothing.&#160; The world will collapse around you.</p>
<p>But if you believe that sabotage and intimidation training has no place in a tax-funded university, please call your governor on Thursday, April 28.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the details:</strong></p>
<p>1.&#160; <strong>Call the Chancellors</strong> of all three schools at the numbers listed below.&#160; Tell them you demand that they fire everyone responsible for these classes, and that they take positive steps to prevent criminal instruction in the system.&#160; </p>
<ul>
<li>Thomas F. George, Chancellor, University of Missouri-St. Louis&#160; <strong><a href="tel:314-516-5252">314-516-5252</a></strong></li>
<li>Leo Morton, Chancellor, University of Missouri-Kansas City <a href="tel:816-235-1101">816-235-1101</a></li>
<li>Brady J. Deaton , Chancellor, University of Missouri <strong><a href="tel:573-882-3387">573-882-3387</a></strong></li>
<li>And the U of M Interim President, Steve Owens, <a href="tel:%28573%29%20882-2011">(573) 882-2011</a>      </li>
</ul>
<p>2.&#160; <strong>Call your Missouri State Senator</strong> and ask him or to demand a vote on SB1, a bill that would give Missouri workers the right to opt out of union membership.&#160; You can <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.us1.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=b6334042e74991364820c98c6&amp;id=ebb6fd874b&amp;e=b1e997cfb9">look up your Senator here.</a>    <br />3. <strong> Call Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley</strong>&#160; at <a href="tel:573-751-1488">573-751-1488</a>.&#160; Tell Speaker Tilley you want SB1 voted on and passed, and you don&rsquo;t care how many of his donors it irritates.    <br />4. <strong>Call Governor Jay Nixon at Phone: </strong><a href="tel:%28573%29%20751-3222"><strong>(573) 751-3222</strong></a></p>
<p>Tell them you want the Labor Studies program suspended until the investigation is over. And you want sabotage and intimidation lessons banned from U of M classrooms.</p>
<p>P.S. We heard that the Patriot/Tea Party legislators in Jefferson City were aware of the University of Missouri story&#160; . . . and furious.&#160; But the establishment Republicans had no idea what anyone was talking about.&#160; We&rsquo;ll be compiling names of Republicans who don&rsquo;t need to return to Jefferson City in 2013, and another list of those who do.&#160; </p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
