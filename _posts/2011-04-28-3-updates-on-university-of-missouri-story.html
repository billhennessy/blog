    were on top of the story and were interested and concerned, gathering facts.

    Bill, I can confirm that the lecturer who resigned was in fact Don Giljum. Interestingly enough, and this is FUNNY, he had announced in Jan of this year that he was retiring.....on May Day 2011.....which is Monday.

    So, we did get action. Unfortunately that action was nothing more than letting this guy retire 5 days early......

  content: 'I''m glad we achieved something. Did anyone notice all of the callers
    to Mark Reardon''s show yesterday were supportive of Giljum, especially the lady
    who was "appalled" at KMOX for publicizing information from someone who has doctored
    videos in the past? Did the Union put out an alert to its members? The silence
    from Giljum was deafening. Now we know why. It was true, as reported by biggovernment.com.
    Thanks to everyone for taking action. '

  content: "You know, Brenda, the unions hire people to sit around and call talk radio.
    They're given scripts, which is why they all sound alike and all sound too prepared.
    \ \n\nI guess if we had lots of money and no ambition, we'd do the same thing. "

<p>Big news day in the advance of liberty in our battle against collectivists.</p>
<p>First, KMOX is reporting that <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/04/28/umsl-investigates-whether-class-promotes-violence/" target="_blank"><strong>an UMSL professor has resigned</strong></a><strong> over the controversy</strong>.&nbsp; For the life of me, I cannot find who the professor is.<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/04/28/umsl-investigates-whether-class-promotes-violence/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10944" title="UPDATE- UMSL Professor Quits &mdash; University of MO Defends Class &laquo; CBS St. Louis" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/UPDATE-UMSL-Professor-Quits-&mdash;-University-of-MO-Defends-Class-&laquo;-CBS-St.-Louis-248x300.png" alt="UMSL Lecturer Resigns " width="248" height="300" /></a> I thought that everyone involved was either an instructor or a guest lecturer.&nbsp; If you know the answer to the riddle, please use the comment form.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>University of Kansas City refuses to accept responsibility</strong> for what goes on in its classroom.&nbsp; Instead of admitting that it was wrong to allow a communist union leader teach that political violence is okay, they&rsquo;ve blamed the messenger.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>Third, responding to my request for their statement, <strong>Ameren UE has released the following:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<em>We are appalled by the comments of the former business manager of a union representing our workers</em> and employees of other companies and by the actions he describes in his lecture.&nbsp; If we ever had any evidence of sabotage at any of our facilities, we would have immediately notified law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>&ldquo; We do not know of any such sabotage but would immediately turn over to law enforcement anyone who threatens our operations in any way. We have a policy of protecting anyone reporting information about sabotage or other illegal actions and encourage anyone to come forward with information about this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have full confidence in our employees and have in place extensive security training programs and procedures aimed at protecting our facilities, our employees and the public. [Emphasis mine.]</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the University of Missouri System, Governor Nixon, and the Missouri Legislature will follow Ameren&rsquo;s lead by denouncing the content of this course and disassociating themselves from courses, lecturers, and employees that promote political violence and sabotage.</p>
<p>Finally, Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder has strongly condemned the content of the University of Missouri System class.&nbsp; As a guest on Dana Loesch&rsquo;s program on News Talk 97.1 FM today, Kinder promised that he will stay on this case until it&rsquo;s resolved.</p>
<p>Please keep on top of your legislators.&nbsp; <strong>Remember, we fought a 40-year Cold War to stop the evil of communism throughout the world.&nbsp; We will not yield it a beachhead in America. </strong></p>
