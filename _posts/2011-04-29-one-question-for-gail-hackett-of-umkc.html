  content: 'Good question. Since Hackett defends the course by claiming the videos
    were taken out of context, shouldn&rsquo;t the University release the videos or
    a full transcript of them? Based on their claims, it seems that would be in the
    University&rsquo;s best interest. '

<p>But <a href="http://www.umkc.edu/provost/about/" target="_blank">Gail Hackett refuses to answer hard questions</a>. </p>
<p>I have one question for the UMKC Provost: <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you agree with Don Giljum&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;I believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois?&rdquo;&#160; </strong></p>
<p>Before you answer, remember that Giljum&rsquo;s use of the personal term &ldquo;Bourgois&rdquo; instead of the the class &ldquo;bourguoisie&rdquo; indicates that Giljim believes in violence against individual members of the middle class.&#160; </p>
<p>In other words, Giljum &ndash; and by extension UMKC and UMSL &ndash; encourage students to violently attack middle class people. </p>
<p>Your answer?</p>
