<p>Almost pulled a muscle laughing in the ride from the Tucson airport to our hotel. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only 5:30 here.&#160; Weird.&#160; That call that &ldquo;time difference&rdquo; for you lefties who read my blog.&#160; Has to do with the earth being round and all.</p>
<p>Been a whirlwind day so far.&#160; Met Trent and Jennifer Humphries, remarkable Tea Party leaders here in Tucson.&#160; Most gracious hosts you can imagine. Funny, dedicated, joyous. </p>
<p>After checking into hotel, I spoke to <a href="http://theeagle939.com/mike-ferguson/" target="_blank">Mike Ferguson of Eagle 93.9 in Columbia</a>, Missouri.&#160; Mike&rsquo;s a fabulous, liberty-loving host who&rsquo;s all over the University of Marxism System story. </p>
<p>Then it was time to strategize with <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Gateway Pundit</a> and Chris Loesch.&#160; </p>
<p>Next is Tea Party University with best-selling author Dr. Larry Schweikart. He wrote the book that Glenn Beck called the best history text book ever, <em><a href="http://www.patriotshistoryusa.com/" target="_blank">A Patriot&rsquo;s History of the United States</a></em>.&#160; We have a copy at the Hennessy house, and so should you. (Speaking of Hennessy House, LU, Ace.) </p>
<p>When&#160; you&rsquo;re meeting Tea Partiers for the first time, you&rsquo;re never really sure what to expect.&#160; Trent Humphries is the best kind, and so is Dr. Schweikart&mdash;laugh-out-loud funny, appropriately sarcastic, brilliantly engaged with life and reality. </p>
<p>On the drive to the hotel, Trent shared his stories of battling America&rsquo;s current brand of demons&mdash;people who actually want to destroy this country and everything it stands for.&#160; That Trent relates stories of such final consequence with humor and cheer testifies to both his high character and his profound intellect. </p>
<p>Time to run to the speech.&#160; Check back soon. </p>
