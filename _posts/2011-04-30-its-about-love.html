<p>Trent and Jennifer Humphries&mdash;hated by all the right people&mdash;just brought to tears to 5,200 eyes. </p>
<p>After Trent told us that the secret to our success is Christ&rsquo;s love, his wife, Jennifer, described the depths to which evil journalists stooped in the moments following the Giffords shooting.</p>
<p>As the Humphries and their small children returned home from the grocery store, they learned that their next door neighbor&mdash;and a beloved friend&mdash;was killed in the tragedy.&#160; </p>
<p>With the Humphries crying and mourning their neighbor&rsquo;s life, reporters shoved cameras and microphones into Jennifer&rsquo;s face and asked, &ldquo;Are you responsible for the shooting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The left does not deserve their love. But the Humphries give it anyway.</p>
