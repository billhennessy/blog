<p>Judy Ancel is the University of Kansas City instructor responsible for teaching students to use violence, sabotage and intimidation as political tools. She&rsquo;s telling the Kansas City Star that she&rsquo;s receiving threats from people upset that she teaches students to threaten others.</p>
<p>I oppose violence, sabotage, and intimidation as political tools.&nbsp; But Judy Ancel&rsquo;s message of violence seems to have gotten through to some people.</p>
<p>Too bad Ancel doesn&rsquo;t use her skills for good<a href="http://www.missourieducationwatchdog.com/2011/04/is-sacrificing-cats-to-achieve-labor.html" target="_blank"> instead of evil</a>.</p>
