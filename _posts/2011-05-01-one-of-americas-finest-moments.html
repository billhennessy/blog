<p>Over 6,000 American and 10,000 allied warriors gave their lives as a result of Bin Laden's evil. These nn addition to the 3,000 who died 9/11 and the tens of thousands of others who've died at Bin Laden's hand. </p>
<p>Since Ollie North's testimony to Congress during the Iran-Contra Hearings in the Reagan Administration, we've been working toward this one man's death. </p>
<p>This is a pivotal moment in US and world history.&#160; After a spate of hurried terrorism attacks to prove they can still act, I expect Islamic terrorism to recede toward the dust bin of history where it belongs.</p>
<p>We may never know the name of the sniper whose bullet carried Bin Laden's wretched soul to the gates of Hell, but I'm about to down a shot of Maker&rsquo;s Mark to his good name. His, and every American who&rsquo;s served since 9/11. </p>
<p>This is one of America's finest moments.</p>
