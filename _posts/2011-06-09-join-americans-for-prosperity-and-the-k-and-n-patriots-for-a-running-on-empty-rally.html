<p>Since President Obama took office, gas prices have nearly doubled. The administration refuses to develop American energy sources&hellip;American energy sources that could help gas prices, electricity prices, and food prices come down.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What: </strong>AFP Foundation&rsquo;s Running On Empty TourWhere: 3005 HWY K O&rsquo;Fallon, MO (Across from Chevy&rsquo;s)  </li>
<li><strong>When: </strong>Saturday, June 11th 10:00 AM &ndash; 12:00 PM  </li>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> To learn what executive actions the Administration can take to bring down fuel costs and bring stability to the market and send them your gas bill!</li>
</ul>
<p>The event will include local and national speakers, food, and a chance to send President Obama your gas bill! We need you to help send the message that it is critical America develop energy sources that will help gas prices, electricity prices, and food prices come down.</p>
<p>Americans are running on empty and the administration needs to hear how regulations and restriction to domestic resources are affecting working families who rely on affordable energy to commute to work, go to school activities and shop for family groceries.</p>
