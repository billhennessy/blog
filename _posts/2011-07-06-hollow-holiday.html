<p>July 4, 2011, felt hollow, like celebrating the birthday of someone deceased. </p>
<p>Independence Day celebrates the birth of an idea: that people create governments and empower them, not the other way around. </p>
<p>Do we still believe that?</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/st-louis-tea-party.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="st louis tea party" border="0" alt="st louis tea party" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/st-louis-tea-party_thumb.jpg" width="425" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, I still believe that.&#160; Morally, at least.&#160; And you probably do, too.&#160; </p>
<p>Does America still believe that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed?&#160; Or do we, as a nation, believe that government has a monopoly on liberty and dispenses it at its will? </p>
<p>As Harvard University pointed out, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/limited-government/thank-you-harvard/" target="_blank">people who vote for the Democrat party</a> no longer believe what the founders believed.&#160; <strong>The Democratic party believes that the federal government owns liberty; you and I must apply for our freedoms. There is no guarantee.</strong>&#160;</p>
<p>Do you realize how profound that is? </p>
<p>Once upon a time, we learned that both parties wanted the same end via different means. But that&rsquo;s no longer true. Now, one party and many independents still believe that people are bigger than government.&#160; But <strong>our government is in the hands of politicians, bureaucrats, and unions who believe that we are their servants</strong>. </p>
<p>At some point, majority or minority becomes irrelevant.&#160; A dictatorial or oligarchical tyranny won&rsquo;t allow a mere majority to end its rule.&#160; </p>
<p>How close are we to that grim eventuality?&#160; Or have we crossed the line?</p>
<p><strong>On August 4, 2011, St. Louis Tea Party Coalition will rally in Kiener Plaza</strong> for the third time.&#160; We come together in celebration of Calvin Coolidge&rsquo;s inauguration, the USS Nautilus&rsquo;s first voyage under the North Pole, and Christopher Columbus&rsquo;s launch for the New World which all occurred on August 3.&#160; It&rsquo;s also Barack Obama&rsquo;s birthday. </p>
<p><strong>Our mission is to restore the meaning of Independence Day</strong>.&#160; Our purpose is to re-energize the idea of liberty in our land.&#160; Our plan is to hold a Tea Party in abject <em>defiance</em> of Barack Obama&rsquo;s power trip. </p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be alone. </p>
