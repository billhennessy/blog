    55% + 32% = 82%. That&rsquo;s pretty close to 80. Obama sure
    knows how to add. Look how much he&rsquo;s added to the debt.

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you: I&rsquo;ve lied. </p>
<p>Usually out of desperation. I&rsquo;ve lied to those closest to me&mdash;those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.&#160; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also told the truth to my own detriment.&#160; In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too. </p>
<p>So maybe Obama&rsquo;s desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream. In desperation, then, he&rsquo;s simply making stuff up. </p>
<p><strong>How do I know Obama&rsquo;s lying?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.carolinapatriots.org/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="obama_big_lie-505x378" border="0" alt="obama_big_lie-505x378" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/obama_big_lie-505x378.jpg" width="244" height="184" /></a><strong>The last time 80 percent of America agreed on something</strong>, the question was whether or not to <a href="http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20193651,00.html" target="_blank">get baby Jessica McClure out of the well</a>. So when I hear that 80 percent of Americans support something, I assume it involves human life. </p>
<p>But somewhere, somehow, Barack Obama has found data revealing that 80 percent of Americans want&mdash;<em>demand</em>&mdash;a tax increase.</p>
<p><strong>For the life of me, I cannot find these people. </strong></p>
<p>I can find <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Rasmussen-debt-deal-55percent/2011/07/14/id/403603" target="_blank">this Rasmussen poll indicating that 55 percent oppose</a><em></em> a tax increase as part of a debt ceiling package. </p>
<p>I can also find a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/148472/Deficit-Americans-Prefer-Spending-Cuts-Open-Tax-Hikes.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup poll that finds only 32 percent</a> would agree to tax increases as part of a deal.</p>
<p>Maybe the President saw this <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1624" target="_blank">Quinnipiac University poll</a> &ndash; with a questioned designed to elicit a particular response.&#160; The question enticed 62 percent of 2,311 registered voters to accept some taxes on the wealthiest Americans.&#160; </p>
<p>So, perhaps, Obama merely took that 62 and round up to the nearest . . . 80?</p>
<p><strong>But there&rsquo;s also the media defensive panic.</strong></p>
<p>When conservative presidents are caught lying or being morons, conservatives tend to admit, well, maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t have said &ldquo;mission accomplished.&rdquo;&#160; </p>
<p>When leftists find their leftist president being a deceitful dolt, they obfuscate.&#160; Huffington Post, New York Times&mdash;all the usual suspects&mdash;have scrubbed their sites of references to the President&rsquo;s lie. (At least, my searches found nothing.&#160; Then, again, I try to not to spend too much time on those sites.)</p>
<p>Instead, the left talks about this being the time to bring taxes into the equation. </p>
<p><strong>Two people who get it . . . clearly:&#160; Mark Steyn and Charles Krauthammer.&#160; </strong></p>
<p>Steyn, as usual, picks apart the stupid in &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/government-308436-debt-year.html" target="_blank">No Bargaining With Obluffer</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/578331/201107141838/Regime-Change-May-Be-Needed-To-Cut-Deficit.htm" target="_blank">Krauthammer destroys Obama&rsquo;s credibility</a> by pointing to Obama&rsquo;s long and recent history of demanding more debt at any cost. </p>
<blockquote><p>   How about last December, when he ignored his own debt commission's recommendations? How about February, when he presented a budget that increases debt by $10 trillion over the next decade? How about April, when he sought a debt-ceiling increase with zero debt reduction attached?
<p>All of a sudden he's a born-again budget balancer prepared to bravely take on his own party by making deep cuts in entitlements. Really? Name one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I lied again.&#160; Eighty percent of Americans don&rsquo;t read <a href="http://hennessysview.com/" target="_blank">Hennessy&rsquo;s View</a> every day.&#160; Not yet, anyway.</p>
