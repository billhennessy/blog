    were powerless to resist, as we are now. Voting does no good, yelling and carrying
    signs does no good, taking it to the courts does no good, writing your senators
    and congressmen does no good. So ? What is left to be done&nbsp; ? I''ll leave
    that to your imagination. '

  content: Doesn't leave much to the imagination. &nbsp;Our Founding Fathers wrote
    to Britain and it did no good, they wrote again and it did no good. &nbsp;They
    carried their own version of signs in forms of boycotting goods, etc. &nbsp;They
    were powerless to resist. &nbsp;Only a Revolution made a difference. &nbsp;It
    was their last resort, it was their bottom line. &nbsp;It's going to take the
    same thing for anything to change. &nbsp;If it doesn't happen then we're doomed
    as a nation. THAT is our bottom line.

<p>Your <a href="http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/whatsinyourscore.aspx" target="_blank">FICO score</a> is a number between 380 and 820 (or something like that) that banks use to determine your credit worthiness.&#160; The higher your FICO score, the better. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about here.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m talking about your FICA score.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bi_weekly_stub.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="bi_weekly_stub" border="0" alt="bi_weekly_stub" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bi_weekly_stub_thumb.jpg" width="362" height="181" /></a></p>
<p>Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan. </p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know <a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/" target="_blank">you had a federal loan</a>?&#160; You do.</p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re 18 years old, you owe the federal government about $46,000</strong>.&#160; That&rsquo;s before your take out your first student loan.&#160; </p>
<p>You can see your FICA score on your very first pay stub.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>The good news</strong>:&#160; you should earn enough in your lifetime to pay off this $48,000 loan that my generation and my dad&rsquo;s took out on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>The bad news</strong>: we keep borrowing more against your loan.&#160; You&rsquo;ll never be able to earn money as fast as we can borrow it.</p>
<p>Your best bet? <strong> Here&rsquo;s two rules for getting out of other people&rsquo;s debt</strong>:</p>
<p>1.&#160; Don&rsquo;t trust anyone who tells you that you&rsquo;ll be better off deeper in government debt. </p>
<p>2.&#160; Don&rsquo;t trust people born before 1982, since <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=11059" target="_blank">we&rsquo;re the ones using identity theft</a> to live richer lives and leave you poor. </p>
<p>And look at your FICA score every payday.&#160; It&rsquo;ll remind you of Rules 1 and 2 above.</p>
