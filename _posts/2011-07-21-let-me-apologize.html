  content: 'What&nbsp; is it exactly that you are apologizing for?&nbsp; I saw nothing
    in your original story indicating Mike Flynn had anything to do with your post.
    Rather it was a mild-mannered chiding of Mr. Riehl for not doing his due diligence
    on his story. '

    Thanks for standing up for what is right Bill! Both you and Ed are stand-up guys!

  content: It was a hit piece on Ed, undeserved at that. This whole issue just proves
    that the establishment of both parties would like to see the TEA Party disappear
    for good. While Ed may not be 'officially' the TEA Party candidate, he has stood
    by the TEA Party from the beginning and supports it's principles fully. We cannot
    say that for his primary opponent, can we?

<p>In my response to Dan Riehl&rsquo;s hit piece on <a href="http://edmartinforcongress.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a>, I wrote one more line than I should have. I wrote about an establishment takeover of Big Government.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Flynn</strong>, the editor of <a href="http://biggovernment.com" target="_blank">Big Government</a>, <strong>has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades</strong>.&#160; His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.</p>
<p>Much more importantly to me, Mike Flynn is a friend of mine.&#160; Sometimes my temper and emotions blind me to the real, human face at the other end of my words.&#160; I didn&rsquo;t mean to insult Mike.&#160; I am sorry, brother.&#160; </p>
<p>I am sorry, too, if I gave anyone a false view of Ed&rsquo;s opponent. There is no RINO in the race for Missouri&rsquo;s Second.&#160; From the Republican primary will emerge a great candidate who will go onto to serve the district, the state, and the nation honorably and well. </p>
<p>On August 8, 2012, the primary over, we will take to the streets and the internet to elect a conservative member of Congress to replace Todd Akin. I don&rsquo;t want to feel like a hypocrite then. I&rsquo;m sure none of us does.</p>
