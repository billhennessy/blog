<p>The headline on July 15 was knee-slapping funny:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Obama says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;</strong><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201107151142dowjonesdjonline000414&amp;title=obama-says-ready-to-moveon-raising-debt-ceiling" target="_blank"><strong>ready to move</strong></a><strong>&rdquo; on debt ceiling. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Really?&nbsp; The man who <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/node/72404" target="_blank">dug a deeper debt hole in two years than anyone else</a> did in 8&mdash;or 15&mdash;is <em>willing</em> to borrow more?</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/12716.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="12716" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/12716_thumb.jpg" alt="12716" width="240" height="159" align="left" border="0" /></a>Say it ain&rsquo;t so.</p>
<p>For those who believe Obama&rsquo;s some sort of deficit hawk, let&rsquo;s take a quick stroll down memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Obama wanted to increase the debt limit by $2.5 trillion in April, and he want <em>no conditions</em> on that increase.&nbsp; In April 2011, <strong>Barack Obama opposed any measures to reduce federal spending</strong>.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Obama refused to produce a plan</strong>. Period. He has no plan for reducing debt. He has no plan for eliminating deficits. He has no plan for creating jobs or helping small business.&nbsp; He has no plan for anything but golf and party.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.&nbsp; <strong>Obama says 80 percent of Americans demand a tax increase</strong>, though he is incapable of citing any source for that number. In other words, he made it up.</p>
<p><strong>Of course Obama&rsquo;s ready to move on borrowing more money</strong>.&nbsp; Borrowing is his only plan. His credit card is maxed out, and he wants the limit raised.</p>
<p>Only, this time, there are men and women in Congress who more beholden to the Millennial generation than to Boomers. Like a good banker, this<strong> Congress wants the borrower to produce a debt reduction plan before lending another penny</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad Obama&rsquo;s finally ready to move on something besides a tee box.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t be completely satisfied until he moves out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
