  content: 'Here is the problem, there are a handful of Reps who are standing up and
    voting against Aerotropolis and they get no credit but get lumped in with the
    rest of the Reps. Rep. Bahr wrote a Capitol Report against Aerotropolis and was
    interviewed by KMOX for his stand. It is well known that he votes based upon his
    beliefs not what leadership wants. He has made Fired Up Missouri more than once.
    And there are other Freshmen Reps doing the same thing. But they do not get support,
    emails, or phone calls telling them that they are appreciated for their stands.
    Besides calling the ones you disagree with, it would be nice to give recognition
    to those that stand on principles. It is not easy to tell Leadership, "No."&nbsp; '

<p>With thanks to <a href="http://showmeinstitute.org/publications/case-study/corporate-welfare/578-aerotropolis-a-raw-deal-for-missouri.html" target="_blank">Show-Me Institute</a> for their wonderful research.</p>
<p>Points to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>The China Hub is not dependent on Aerotropolis</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.showmedaily.org/2011/07/aerotropolis-author-doesnt-think-saint-louis-proposal-will-work.html" target="_blank">author of the plan thinks it will fail</a></li>
<li>St. Louis has 18 million square feet of empty warehouse space right now</li>
<li>Aerotropolis would <a href="http://www.showmedaily.org/2011/06/air-cargo-expet-hammers.html" target="_blank">hurt many companies</a> who have vacant warehouse space</li>
<li>Aerotropolis would transfer $360 million tax dollars to just two entities: a private developer and the City of St. Louis</li>
<li>No one knows if or <a href="http://www.showmedaily.org/2011/06/eco-devo-madlibs-so-are-5000.html" target="_blank">how many jobs Aerotropolis might create</a>.&nbsp; Even the RCGA has released 3 separate guesses</li>
<li>Most Missouri Legislators are clueless about the bill&mdash;but your State Rep voted for it, anyway.</li>
