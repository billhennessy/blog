  content: A couple of changes that would help a lot would be to get non criminal
    illegal aliens started toward citizenship so they could be on the taxes roles
    like the rest of us. The second would be to put a time limit on able bodied welfare
    recipients. There is no reason either should be allowed to live off the system
    without contributing.&nbsp;

<p>Our present crisis is &nbsp;the result of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much borrowing</li>
<li>Too much spending</li>
<li>Too much government control</li>
<li>Too much taxing</li>
</ul>
<p>Those who argue that America needs to borrow, spend, regulate, and tax more are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. &nbsp;Their argument is absurd &nbsp;on its face.</p>
<p><strong>The way to increase revenue to government is to increase the economic activity of the people</strong>. &nbsp;You do that by giving the people maximum control over their destinies. &nbsp;They will pursue their dreams. In the process, they will fund a responsible and constrained government.</p>
<p>When the government borrows money, it determines for you how you will spend your future earnings. &nbsp;That, too, is wrong. &nbsp;Morally wrong. &nbsp;Make them stop.</p>
<p>Write and <a href="http://fearlessrevolution.com/blog/the-us-congressional-twitter-directory.html" target="_blank">tweet your senator and representative</a> today. &nbsp;Tell them "Stop spending my future. Balance the budget. #tcot"</p>
