<p>Yes, the Tea Party movement influenced what went on in Washington.&nbsp; </p>
<p>No, the Tea Party is not the winner.&nbsp; (No one won.)</p>
<p>No, this debt deal won&rsquo;t guide the government off the road toward bankruptcy.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; No Entitlement Fix:&nbsp; In fact, it appears that entitlements aren&rsquo;t touched.&nbsp; Entitlements are the nation&rsquo;s spending problem.&nbsp; Not roads and bridges, not the military.&nbsp; Entitlements. Until we arrest and reverse growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, we&rsquo;re spitting in the ocean.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Military Spending Won&rsquo;t Be Cut:&nbsp; Remember the &ldquo;peace dividend&rdquo; after the Berlin Wall fell?&nbsp; Then Saddam invaded Iraq.&nbsp; Obama and the Dems know damn well that Republicans will forgive them for ignoring planned military cuts as soon as some threat appears on the horizon.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s always a threat.&nbsp; These cuts, if implemented, will be quickly reversed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Cuts Are Someone Else&rsquo;s Problem:&nbsp; The cuts don&rsquo;t start until we have a new Congress and a new President. That&rsquo;s asking a future generation to fix yesterday&rsquo;s problems.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s cowardice and irresponsibility.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s perfectly Establishment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t Save Credit Rating (Unless Moody&rsquo;s Was Lying):&nbsp; Moody&rsquo;s reported on Friday that none of the proposed bills would solve the nation&rsquo;s long-term debt problem.&nbsp; If we&rsquo;re going to lose AAA, why not use that trauma as the impetus for real financial reform?&nbsp; Instead, we&rsquo;re kicking the can down the road to save the President and Establishment Republicans.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Favors the Establishment:&nbsp; Most importantly, this bill demonstrates the problem with Establishment politicians: they&rsquo;re first duty (they believe) is to their next election.&nbsp; Boehner abandoned his party&rsquo;s principled members and crafted a deal to win over some Democrats.&nbsp; That might protect him and Obama.&nbsp; The taxpayer&mdash;especially Millennials and younger&mdash;get screwed.</p>
<p>Question the Establishment, kids.&nbsp; It is not your friend.</p>
