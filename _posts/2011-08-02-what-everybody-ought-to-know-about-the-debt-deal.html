    that we were able to do what we did given that we were facing a difficult situation
    in which it was going to be up to the President to decide what checks to write
    and which not to write, and which parts of the budget to fund and which to cut.&nbsp;
    I think Boehner and Tea Party caucus memebers did the best they could in the very
    limited options they had.&nbsp; \nVarious agencies and Nations are very critical
    of our debt and deficit, and we know they're right.&nbsp; Everyone but the most
    ideologically-driven statists know we need to cut spending drastically.&nbsp;
    \nI believe that if all House Republicans had voted against the plan and kept
    the gridlock situation that THAT would be a Pyrrhic Victory.&nbsp; I believe that
    would've given the Dems the upper hand in the 2012 elections.&nbsp; Yes, we would've
    stood our ground and won the battle, but I believe it would have cost us the 2012
    elections which is arguably the whole war, given that&nbsp; if Obama wins&nbsp;
    a second term and we don't gain the senate and retain the House, IMHO, you can
    kiss the Constitution and&nbsp; the Republic goodbye.&nbsp; If he wins a 2nd&nbsp;
    term, Obama will not hold back...he will do the full Alinksy/Cloward &amp; Piven.&nbsp;
    He would likely be able to change the balance of the SCOTUS to be on his side.&nbsp;
    \nI believe Krauthammer and Thomas Sowell during the last few weeks spoke well
    to the situation and highlighted the limited power that the Tea Party caucus members
    have now.&nbsp; 2010 was a big step in the right direction, but we need the WH
    and Senate to make the kind of changes we know need to be made.&nbsp; I also like
    what Paul Ryan has been saying.&nbsp; And I resent those who have skewered Boehner.&nbsp;
    \nLet's stop the circular firing squad and trying to one-up each other on who
    has the best Constitutional Conservative credibility.&nbsp; I wonder what I would've
    done if I was in Boehner's shoes, and what those who voted against the plan would've
    done if they were in his shoes.&nbsp; let's be happy the result wasn't worse,
    and work our butts off to win the war for 2012.&nbsp; Peace.\n&nbsp;"

<p>There&rsquo;s hysteria on both sides.&nbsp; From <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/08/meat-sweet-or-debt-deal-the-mystery-of-the-satan-sandwich.html" target="_blank">Satan Sandwiches</a> to &ldquo;killing future generations,&rdquo; you&rsquo;d think Congress is voting on a bill to launch the US nuclear arsenal on Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>There are reasons to distrust the deal.&nbsp; <a href="http://hennessysview.com/limited-government/5-things-to-question-about-debt-deal/" target="_blank">I distrust it</a>.</p>
<p>There are great reasons to<a href="http://blog.al.com/sweethome/2011/08/sen_jeff_sessions_announces_on.html"> distrust the Congressional committee</a> charged with finding more cuts.</p>
<p>The bill does far too little, too slowly,&nbsp;to prevent a credit rating cut in the near future.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think the world would end without raising the debt ceiling.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-11115 alignleft" style="margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;" title="washington-valley-forge" src="http://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/washington-valley-forge-300x154.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="154" /></p>
<p>That said,&nbsp;the reality is something was going to give. Most members of Congress are Establishment&mdash;and the Establishment hates risk, even smart, principled risk.&nbsp; Sorry&mdash;just reality.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s keep pushing for more cuts, for entitlement reform, for a government that obeys the law and operates within the limits of our Constitution.</p>
<p>The Tea Party movement rattled both Establishment Republicans and President Obama.&nbsp; We have a voice. But if we scream ourselves hoarse, that voice will weaken&mdash;and the many, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/tea-party/unknowing-believers/" target="_blank">many Unknowing Believers</a> will close their minds to us.</p>
