    Finally someone is rejuvinating the Tea Party.&nbsp; What I have seen in the past couple of months is the St Louis Tea Party sitting around, playing with their cell phones.&nbsp; The objective of Tea Party's is not power and prestige and not social networking in comparison to political networking.

    I totally support your article.&nbsp; Keep up the good work.

    Like the Russian Revolution, the political 'change' in this country has been driven by a handful, literally a handful of people.&nbsp; the  Tea Party is not a 'handful' it is he largest grassroots movement in this country since the civl rights movement, or he Abolitionist/Underround Railroad.&nbsp; It's work.&nbsp; It took the Abolitionist nearly forty years of supporing the Underground Railroad to wipeout slavery in this country, but they perserved.&nbsp; the  Tea Party's work is not done. And it is gaining support daily as people watch the antics of Congress.&nbsp; Fresh horses?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; this work needs fresh horses.
    more conservative candidates need to run, and, given a clear choice, the nation will throw out incumbants this election cycle as never before.&nbsp; It is a very bad election cycle to be a Democrat, and there is work to be done.&nbsp; Look how the tea party congress members shocked with resolve and incorruptable stance.&nbsp; there are patriots out there to encourage to run.

    "Launching an upward spiral of effective action"--bingo!&nbsp; (Sorry my comments are long.)

    Thanks for everything you have done and continue doing.&nbsp; It's vital!

    I'm an "out-state" tea party organizer, pretty "burned out" on the whole passive rally thing.&nbsp; I've been yammering at people in my area, saying that the time for passive gatherings is past, and now the patriots must engage locally.&nbsp; This is where one individual can make such an impact!&nbsp; Attend the meetings of the bodies that spend local taxpayer $$$:&nbsp; county commission, city council, and school board, for starters.&nbsp; Don't even make any comments, necessarily...just sit there, soaking it all in.&nbsp; If you can go online and get the meeting agenda, and maybe even a packet for the meeting (warning:&nbsp; first go buy a new ink cartridge if you print the whole thing); go to the meeting with it on your clipboard.&nbsp; Make those people "do what they do" in front of your eyes.&nbsp; They'll never know what you're thinking.&nbsp; I thought my tea party group should have set up a group of 4-6 for each board, rotating responsibility for attending among those individuals, who would later post a short summary of what happened.

    About a dozen of us got fired up about an unjust extension of a sales tax in our city, that originally passed with a date for its sunset.&nbsp; Several months of pretty hard work later, it failed 2 to 1.&nbsp; People committed to good governance and fiscal integrity can make a difference!

    The people whose wealth is sometimes being totally squandered, whose communities are being centrally planned, and whose lives are being micromanaged must start locally.&nbsp; They must demand transparency (i.e., when/where are those darned meetings?) and accountability.&nbsp; The local scene is the proving ground!

<p>Do you ever feel like Dan Blackford?</p>
<p>Dan is an original Tea Party organizer. He&rsquo;s been at it since 2009. And he&rsquo;s just about worn out. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903635604576474050402040650.html?KEYWORDS=tea+party" target="_blank">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, Blackford&rsquo;s given up his position in the&nbsp; Houston Tea Party.</p>
<blockquote><p>All the protests, the organization, the fundraising, the block-walking, has it done anything? Are we better off than we were two years ago? I say 'No.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>How many other people feel the way Dan feels?&nbsp; Do you think the past two-and-a-half years were a waste?</p>
<p><strong>You Are Not Alone</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I do.&nbsp; Since the end of 2009, I have been ready to throw in the towel many times.&nbsp; Each time, my friends bolstered me.&nbsp; They reminded me how far we&rsquo;d come since February &lsquo;09.&nbsp; The reminded me that nothing has stopped our movement, locally or nationally.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s my turn to bolster the spirits of those like Dan Blackford.</p>
<p><strong>Rome Didn&rsquo;t Fall in a Day</strong></p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s get something straight: your expectations must match reality.&nbsp; The United States has been on the path to bigger government, more debt, and less liberty since the Constitutional Convention.&nbsp; Larry Elder points out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congress began ignoring its lack of authority for charity before the ink dried on the Constitution. When Congress appropriated $15,000 to assist French refugees in 1792, James Madison &ndash; a Founding Father and principal author of the Constitution &ndash; wrote, "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution, which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents."<br />
Read more: <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=108045#ixzz1U3lot3ii">Charity: Not in the Constitution</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">The tendency of government to grow is not new.&nbsp; Nor will it go away. Let&rsquo;s accept what we cannot change and move on.</span>&nbsp; <span style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">Please don&rsquo;t make the mistake of assuming we could roll back sixty years of rapid government growth with a single election.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #f7f7f7;"><strong>Everybody&rsquo;s Talkin&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Next, let&rsquo;s look at what we have accomplished.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s begin with the fact that Dan Blackford gets quoted on the front page of the Wall Street Journal more than two years into the Tea Party era.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Do you know how many nascent movements and organizations are born and die in any two year period?&nbsp; Do you know how rare it is for a movement to survive 30 months?&nbsp; Do you realize much rarer it is for a movement that&rsquo;s only two years old to drive 100 percent of the conversation about government?</span></p>
<p><span>Sure, it&rsquo;s easy to say, &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; is all the Tea Party&rsquo;s gotten for its work.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what Ellen Gilmore of LaGrange Tea Party told WSJ.&nbsp; I would tell Ellen that driving the conversation is a very big deal in a republic.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">Tomorrow&rsquo;s decisions&mdash;in primaries, in general elections, in school board meetings, and in Congress and the Supreme Court&mdash;evolve from to today&rsquo;s conversations.&nbsp; In 2008, no one cared what Ellen Gilmore&nbsp; or Dan Blackford thought about anything. Today their thoughts are on the front page of one of the most read papers in the world. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">If we give up now, Dan and Ellen will be correct: it will have been a waste of precious time, money, and energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">But we&rsquo;re not giving up.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not standing still.&nbsp; We are still advancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #f7f7f7;"><strong>The After Party</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Over next several weeks, we will roll out a plan. The plan builds upon our accomplishments and strengths.&nbsp; It looks reality squarely in the eye.&nbsp; And it begins to fill the void we feel in our movement and in ourselves. </span></p>
<p><span>Once we fill that void, we&rsquo;ll begin moving the debate a little faster.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to launch an upward spiral of effective action. </span></p>
<p><span>Beginning&nbsp; Sunday, August 7, read every episode of The After Party series on <a href="http://www.stlouisteaparty.com">www.stlouisteaparty.com</a>.&nbsp; And put a placeholder on your calendar for the 3rd Thursday of every month.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to launch the next wave. And you won&rsquo;t be alone.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
