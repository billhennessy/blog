  content: 'We could just serve what they had at the last downgrade party. Oh yeah!
    We never had one before. Well, How about bread and water, can we afford that?
    Maybe the Obamas can cancel any upcoming vacations so we can upgrade to bologna
    sandwiches. Then again, Michelle thinks we are too fat anyway so lets just skip
    the food and play pin the tale on the asses. '

<p>Answer: Bondbonds.</p>
<p>Sometimes the only option is humor.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.</p>
<p>We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good.&nbsp; Instead, wise men and women <strong>focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed America&rsquo;s credit rating, liberty, and economy</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes United States Marines, Rangers, Delta Force, SEALs, an the like so deadly is not bloodlust . . . it&rsquo;s discipline.&nbsp; Had an angry mob descended on Usama&rsquo;s compound in May, he&rsquo;d be alive and the mod would be dead.</p>
<p><strong>Steely determination</strong> to electorally destroy.&nbsp; Lacking that discipline will hurt the cause.</p>
<p>The next meeting is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=200026046720114" target="_blank">September 15 at 7:00 at Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton</a>.&nbsp; Please bring a cold, steely resolve.&nbsp; But leave room for a warm smile for friends.</p>
