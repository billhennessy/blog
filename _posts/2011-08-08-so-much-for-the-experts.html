<p>Rule by the cleverest brute dominated most of human history. Then came the bizarre notion &ndash; in Greece and Rome to degrees, but mostly in the USA &ndash; of rule by the governed.</p>
<p>Rule by the governed gave way in 20th century to rule by experts.</p>
<p>Many so called &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; warned against the expert thing. Eventually, conservatives believed, the experts would either fall prey to the clever brutes or to a world too complex for a small group to manage.</p>
<p>We avoided, up to now, the clever brutes. But that complex world, manageable by individuals working together voluntarily, has proven too much for the geniuses like Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke.</p>
<p>The world will change a lot over the next 15 years.&nbsp; The experts having been discredited, we will choose to trust ourselves and each other&mdash;or we will submit a clever brute.</p>
<p>Choose wisely.</p>
