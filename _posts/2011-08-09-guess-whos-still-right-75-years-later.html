<p>Dale Carnegie, of course. </p>
<p>Published in 1936, Carnagie&rsquo;s book, <em>How to Make Friends and Influence People</em>, remains one of the most important works in interpersonal human relations ever written. </p>
<p>I wish I&rsquo;d been humble enough to read this book when I was younger.&nbsp; Might have saved myself a lot of trouble, reputation, and embarrassment. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt: </p>
<blockquote><h5>Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. </strong> </li>
<li>Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say "You're Wrong."  </li>
<li>If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.  </li>
<li>Begin in a friendly way.  </li>
<li>Start with questions to which the other person will answer yes.  </li>
<li>Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.  </li>
<li>Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers.  </li>
<li>Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.  </li>
<li>Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.  </li>
<li>Appeal to the nobler motives.  </li>
<li>Dramatize your ideas.  </li>
<li>Throw down a challenge.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me apologize to you if I&rsquo;ve violated one of these simple rules.&nbsp;</p>
