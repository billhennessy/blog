  content: As a 63-year-old white Tea Partier who grew up in E. St. Louis, Ill, I
    weep with joy that people of all classes are waking up to the freedom that is
    still theirs in this country.&nbsp; I bristle when&nbsp;ANYTIME&nbsp;human beings
    are expected to&nbsp; leave their&nbsp;humanity at the door and "toe the line."&nbsp;
    &nbsp;God Bless America.

<p>"I will die fighting this Democrat-Media Complex, and I will fight alongside you."</p>

<p>The three-day "Meet Me in the 'Lou" conference is the work of the remarkable people at <a href="http://moveonup.ning.com/">MoveOnUp.org</a>. &nbsp;Today's day two, and Breitbart is the luncheon speaker.</p>
<p>MoveOnUp.org represents the people that the Civil Rights Industry never wants you to meet: black conservatives, escapees from what Star Parker calls "Uncle Sam's Plantation." &nbsp;(Star Parker was the headline speaker at the evening's <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2011/08/star-parker-shines-at-move-on-up-org-annual-conference-in-st-louis/">Sherman Thompson Parker Scholarship Banquet.</a>)</p>
<p>What frightens the left about MoveOnUp.org is their independence. &nbsp;Real independence. &nbsp;The independence that exists only in educated minds that refuse to bow down to their racial overlords.</p>
<p>"How will you feel," said Shelby Emmett, "when you're children or grandchildren ask, 'Mom, tell me what it was like when we were</p>

<p>free.'" Shelby, a Detroit native now working in Maryland, won a roomful of fans and a mountain of respect at her morning breakout session. I <a href="http://constitution21st.blogspot.com/">follow her blog about the Constitution in the 21st Century</a>.</p>
<p>Brietbart continues. &nbsp;"They don't care what happens in the inner city . . . as long as <em>you</em>&nbsp;vote Democrat."</p>

<p><a href="http://frederickdouglassfoundationofmichigan.blogspot.com/">Stacy Swimp, president of The Frederick Douglass Society of Michigan</a> (soon going national) also spoke in a morning breakout. His personal tale mirrors the hopes of MoveOnUp.org. &nbsp;With the help of a strong Christian faith, he pulled himself out of the bogs of statist limitations and victimology. &nbsp;He refused to live as a slave to a decaying social norm. Stacy adopted Frederick Douglass's determination to "go as a man and not as a slave."</p>
<p>Other remarkable speakers included Cherylyn Harley LeBon on immigration policy and Kenneth McClenton of American Conservative Party.</p>

<p>After Breitbart's luncheon speech, which ended with a 3 minute standing ovation, we met some local lefties in the lobby for conversation. &nbsp; But that's a story for later . . .</p>
