  content: Buffet is a liberal and that's why he agrees with their policies.&nbsp;
    He erroneously thinks he is a financial genius, when most people attained wealth
    through luck, inheritance, unscupulousness, and many other less savory means.&nbsp;
    No one gains power or wealth without wanting it more than anything else.&nbsp;
    Why should I respect the opinions of this man?

  content: 'Better yet.&nbsp; Andrew Carnegie spent a good amount of his fortune on
    the building of scores of public libraries.&nbsp; If Warren wants to help the
    poor, he could do it much more cost-effectively through private charities.&nbsp;
    He could even start some new ones of his own to help the poor.&nbsp; Giving the
    money to the Fed Govt will require most of the money be spent on the massively
    expensive Fed Govt bureaicracy.&nbsp; Not a very good use of one''s discretionary
    income to be used to help the poor.&nbsp; But, libs think the only way to help
    the poor is through the Govt.&nbsp; Govt dependency equals a kind of slavery? '

<p>Warren Buffett makes <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903999904576466541882356616.html" target="_blank">the erroneous claim</a> that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary.&nbsp; He claims that the government thus &ldquo;coddles&rdquo; the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alg_warren_buffett.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="alg_warren_buffett" border="0" alt="alg_warren_buffett" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alg_warren_buffett_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="173"/></a>rich.&nbsp; <strong>He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him</strong>, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.</p>
<p>Buffett is half right.&nbsp; He proves that government coddles people by<strong> asking the government to solve his problem of guilt</strong>. </p>
<p>To help Buffett learn to take care of himself, without government help. here are 3 ways he can assuage his guilt and built his self-esteem by solving the problem himself. </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>Pay all you want</strong> to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <strong>Go Galt</strong>. Make less money. Give away what you have.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <strong>Refuse all corporate welfare</strong> and tax breaks for <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/22130601/" target="_blank">all Berkshire-Hathaway companies</a>, saving the treasury billions.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <strong>Return the billions in corporate welfare</strong> that your companies have claimed over the past 5 years. </p>
<p>5. <strong>Pay your poor secretary more</strong>. Increase her salary until she&rsquo;s in the same, privileged, low tax bracket you enjoy. </p>
<p>There.&nbsp; Three simple ways that you, Warren Buffett, can solve your little guilt problem <strong>without asking the government to fix your problems for you</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>BTW, Mr. Buffett, please realize that giving the government 100% of your wealth and all future earnings <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/2011/08/11/does-this-explain-americas-downgrade/" target="_blank">will have almost no effect on the national debt</a>.&nbsp; But it will add your name to the dole. </p>
<p>Now, since we&rsquo;re all capitalists around here, and because I&rsquo;d like to get closer to your low tax bracket, where do I send my invoice for $250,000 for this advice?</p>
