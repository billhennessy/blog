    We get our liberty through the constitution - a man made contract between a government and it's people. Please stop with the Jesus talk and focus on liberty. &nbsp;If you want to believe in this&nbsp;superstition, go ahead but don't try to imply that god gives liberty. &nbsp;If that's the case, we're doomed because there is no evidence that god even exists. &nbsp;I put my faith in the constitution and the people who believe in it.

    It should be very clear at this point that religion has nothing to do with morality so stop trying to perpetuate that myth. &nbsp;Morality comes from a community of common courtesy. &nbsp;This is just an ad for a (preacher's) business, and it should not attach itself to a genuine liberty movement.
