  content: 'I wonder what Hoffa would do to union members in the Tea Party.&nbsp;
    Some union bosses believe they run a religion grounded in meretricious envy and
    the mob think redolent of their sandbox mentality.&nbsp; Any person, whether or
    not they belong to a union, has the right to live by and for him or her self without
    hindrance from him.&nbsp; '

<blockquote>We got to keep an eye on the battle that we face: The war on Tea Partiers. And you see it everywhere, it is the Unions. And you know, there is only one way to beat and win that war. <strong>The one thing about Tea Party people is we like a good fight.</strong> And you know what? They've got a war, they got a war with us and there's only going to be one winner. It's going to be the Tea Partiers of Missouri, and America. We're going to win that war.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Rick Santelli, this is your army. We are ready to march. <strong>Let's take these son of bitches out</strong> and give America back to an America where we belong!</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I say &ldquo;Tea Party Leader's message?&rdquo; Sorry. I meant to say that was a paraphrasing of <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2011/09/05/jimmy_hoffa_at_obama_event_on_gop_lets_take_these_son_of_bitches_out.html">Jimmy Hoffa&rsquo;s message to his Teamsters</a>. Hoffa introduced President Barack Obama. That&rsquo;s part of Obama&rsquo;s new civil tone.</p>

<p>I swapped Tea Party and Tea Partiers with union and workers.&nbsp; Had I or any Tea Partier actually said those words, the FBI would already be at our doors. But union crooks get applause from the President for calling for violence.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it odd that a man whose father so famously failed at violence as a political tactic would use violence to get his (very unpopular) way?</p>
