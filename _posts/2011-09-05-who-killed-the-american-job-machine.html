<p>Maureen Dowd&rsquo;s having trouble slathering make-up on her favorite pigs these days. Her President&mdash;the man for whom she surrendered all pretense of intelligence, wisdom, and self-control&mdash;is flailing.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/maureen_dowd_x200.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 2px 10px 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="maureen_dowd_x200" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/maureen_dowd_x200_thumb.jpg" alt="maureen_dowd_x200" width="200" height="200" align="left" border="0" /></a>And <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/opinion/dowd-one-and-done.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">Maureen Dowd is going all wobbly</a>.&nbsp; Wobbly on Obama. Wobbly on America.&nbsp; Wobbly on life.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s an exceprt:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the razor&rsquo;s edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maureen Dowd makes a big mistake in blaming Obama alone for America&rsquo;s jobless carnival of mayhem.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not all his fault.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not make the same mistake made by Dowd and her friends.&nbsp; Barack Obama did not wreck the American Job Machine.</p>
<p>His Democrat Party did.</p>
<p>Face it.&nbsp; When the Democrats took overwhelming control of Congress in 2007, unemployment was 5.5 percent.&nbsp; When John Boehner pried the Speaker&rsquo;s gavel from Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s dry, cold claw, unemployment stood at 9.9 percent.&nbsp; (<a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/esd/lmea/countydashboard/URateDetails.aspx?area=53_01_000000">Source</a>)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a 44.4% increase in the unemployment number.</p>
<p>For two years, Democrats controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House.&nbsp; What did they do with that power?</p>
<p>They created a new entitlement.&nbsp; Even after admitting that the <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/geithner-admits-spending-in-obamas-budget-is-unsustainable/">existing spending programs were unsustainable</a>, Democrats invented yet another new entitlement.</p>
<p>Sure, George W. Bush and the Tom Delay Republicans had their problems.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re not around THIS TIME.</p>
<p>We are living under a 100 percent Democrat economy now. The GOP&rsquo;s grasp on 1/2 of&nbsp; 1/3 of the government can&rsquo;t undo 4 years of Democrat damage.</p>
<p>We have a Democrat in the White House and Democrats running the Senate.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the Republicans in the House preventing Obama from moving the economy forward; it&rsquo;s the Democrats in the Senate and White House <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2011/07/thanks-barack-64-of-small-businesses-will-not-be-hiring-this-year/">frightening natural risk-takers</a> into keeping their job-creating money in their pockets.</p>
<p>I can see only one solution to the continuing unemployment nightmare facing people in America. That&rsquo;s to finish the work started in 2010 by turning over the Senate and the White House.</p>
