    It looks like I am still disconnected in Jefferson County. My political interests seem to have a hard time emerging. But they ARE emerging (I was more issue oriented as opposed to political).
    So tell me how/why&nbsp;Jefferson County&nbsp;Council was one of the happiest stories emerging from the&nbsp;2010 election. I DO know it used to have a Democrat base, since then, of course I know what that implies :) and a charter government was put in place....I can only imagine the changes....Have a link(s)?

    Here's the Post's story on the Jefferson County Council elections of 2010. But there's more to the story.

    Democrats who had controlled Jefferson County for a long time fought the transition to a charter form of government.

    You should check out Jeffco Tea Party . Ken and his crew have done a fabulous job of building one of the best countywide tea party groups in the USA.

<p>You might have heard that Jefferson County Council was one of the happiest stories emerging from the 2010 election.</p>
<p>Well, some of the conservative champions who led the crusade to capture the council want to help more citizens become political leaders.</p>
<p>On Saturday, September 24, you can help.&nbsp; You can help while having blast of a good time in Crystal City.</p>

<p>Events all day long, including live music in the caverns from 7 to 9 pm.</p>
<p>Make a day of it, and help bring some new blood to office in Jefferson County.</p>
