<p>Have you been watching the 9-11 anniversary programs?</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0783.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 2px 10px 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_0783" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0783_thumb.jpg" alt="IMG_0783" width="325" height="243" align="left" border="0" /></a>I have. They remind me of several things. My Uncle Patrick Mahon, for one. Uncle Pat and I watched M<em>A</em>S*H reruns every day at 4:00 when I was a kid.&nbsp; We met at my Aunt Mame&rsquo;s house (unwed sister to Pat and my mom).&nbsp; Uncle Pat drank coffee&mdash;usually black with sugar&mdash;and smoked unfiltered cigarettes.</p>
<p>Uncle Pat retired from the St. Louis Fire Department in about 1976 (rough guess).&nbsp; He&rsquo;d risen to Battalion Chief. Like most retired firemen, Pat remained active in the union and guided many, many younger fire fighters. The fire department&mdash;its history, its nobility, and its future&mdash;were true loves.</p>
<p>So was the military.&nbsp; Pat was a WWII veteran.&nbsp; He served the entire length of that great war, and on both coasts. He was Chief Petty Officer not long into the war, having enlisted before Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; He honored those who served and cherish the flag and the nation we protected.</p>
<p>In WWII, Pat was an Aviation Radioman.&nbsp; Flight fascinated him. He flew Catalinas and other Navy planes all around the Pacific. Whenever there was an air show, Pat was there.&nbsp; When Scott Air Force Base opened up to the public, Pat took us.&nbsp; He marveled at the power and elegance of human flight, especially military air power.</p>
<p>Uncle Pat passed away almost exactly one year prior to 9/11/2001.&nbsp; Had he been around a year later, he&rsquo;d have been glued to the television as his three great passions in life&mdash;aviation, fire fighting, and national defense&mdash;converged in the American psyche like never before.</p>
<p>With the memory of 9-11 fresh in our minds, now is the perfect time to begin the <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/2011/09/03/the-after-party-guide-book/">next phase of the Tea Party movement</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, September 15, at 7 pm, St. Louis Tea Party Coalition embarks in the next phase of the war for American greatness.&nbsp; We will begin a 12-month program to repair the fabric of American society.</p>
<p>Those who attend our first meeting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton will receive a commemorative button. You will be the pioneers of this next wave.</p>
<p>You will also be the leaders of a new units of community.&nbsp; These units will not be overtly political. They will be social. And civic.&nbsp; They will make all of us a better team.</p>
<p>Over the next 12 months, we get closer to each other. We will prepare ourselves for the next crisis and the next opportunity.&nbsp; We will reduce our reliance on the federal government and increase our faith in ourselves and each other.</p>
<p>Were Uncle Pat here today, he&rsquo;d be so proud of this St. Louis Tea Party Coalition.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;d deliver a warning, subtly, kindly: &ldquo;You can never let this country be unprepared again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t, Uncle Pat.&nbsp; Following your example, we shall prepare, and we will prevail.</p>
