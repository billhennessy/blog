    Sorry to confuse you. I've written so much on Aerotropolis issue that I sometimes forget readers could be new to the topic.

    Aerotropolis refers to a bill in the Missouri legislaturethat would provide tax credits to specific developers for building warehouses and other facilities in hopes of winning more import and export business with China. Here's a recent Post Dispatch article on the subject--which is also devoid bill numbers, from what I can tell.

    As far as the law Nixon is breaking, I'm going to say, please click the link.  It's case law, which makes for hideous reading to a lot of people. The link is there--Kinder v. Holden. Because the case is very complex, and because I'm not a lawyer, it seemed wise to let the readers dig for themselves.  (Simply linking to the source rather than summarizing the source is pretty common among bloggers.)

    According to several House freshmen (and their staff) I have spoken to, the House Speaker uses threats of limiting committee assignment and redistricting to keep principled members in line.  Unfortunately, these freshmen won't go on the record for fear of further reprisals.

    I have the flu. I was not in a public men's room today, nor was I in a
    Panera. I heard about Nixon's Executive Order from people in Jefferson City
    at the time, and it was confirmed by the Post
    Dispatchand
    KMOX.
    My sources for the Tilley stories include members of the Missouri House and
    their staff who asked not to be identified. Those conversation occurred over
    many months.  My source for much information about Aerotropolis is The
    Show-Me Institute.


    Finally, thank you for reading and taking the time comment.  It means a lot.
     I'm not trying to confuse anyone.  Between a fever, unmentionable symptoms,
    and my familiarity with topics, I do tend to lose sight of the common
    knowledge of issues.  I'll remember that in the future.

<p>When <a href="http://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2011/09/gov-jay-nixon-runs-on-obamacare-in-2012.html">Jay Nixon decided to ignore the voters, ignore the Missouri Constitution, and ignore the power of the legislature</a>, he spit in our faces. But why?</p>
<p>Maybe because his <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/09/14/3143184/frustration-mounts-as-missouri.html">special session is failing</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Maybe because, to save the centerpiece of that legislation, House Speaker Steve Tilley needed protection from the grass roots.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Maybe because Jay Nixon is as crooked as a dog&rsquo;s hind leg and doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot about you, your state, your country, or the law.&nbsp; (H/T to <a href="http://edmartinforcongress.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a> for pointing us to <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/mo-court-of-appeals/1338439.html">Kinder v. Holden, which makes Nixon&rsquo;s action illegal</a>.)</p>
<p>Maybe because <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/09/nixon-up-big-on-kinder.html">Nixon believes he has no chance of losing re-election next year</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s a combination of these.</p>
<p>In this case, motives count. For that reason, I say we keep our focus on the Missouri legislature, demanding that Aerotropolis remain as the Senate left it. Here&rsquo;s why. </p>
<p>Governor <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/mo-court-of-appeals/1338439.html">Jay Nixon is playing games</a> with an Executive Order that would implement ObamaCare exchanges in Missouri without authorizing legislation. His timing seems intentional.&nbsp; He wants to get the grass roots folks off Tilley&rsquo;s back so that Tilley and restore Aerotropolis earmarks into the Economic Development bill pending in the Special Session. </p>
<p>This makes sense.&nbsp; On Tuesday, we learned that Tilley was splitting the Republican House Caucus into 4 groups to use the persuasion of power over Aerotropolis.&nbsp; (Apparently, Tilley likes to use some aggressive psychological techniques on Tea Party freshmen to get them to comply with his will&mdash;or, at least, the will Tilley&rsquo;s donors.)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.showmedaily.org/2011/09/will-the-missouri-house-ram-300-million-of-aerotropolis-cash-back-into-the-bill.html">Tilley wants to shove into the bill the $300 million</a> the Missouri Senate removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If Tilley&rsquo;s a conservative, I&rsquo;m a Hottentot.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, by overriding the Missouri Constitution (by violating Kinder v. Holden) and emasculating the Missouri legislature, Nixon gets $21 million in federal money to hand&nbsp; out to friends, he gets Aerotropolis funding, and he gets a successful end to his Special Session.&nbsp; Tilley gets even more mind control over his House reps and whatever goodies are promised to his campaign coffers from the Aerotropolis supporters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You and me? We get screwed, of course.&nbsp;</p>
