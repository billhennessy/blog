    we will. It always works out.

    camp for a pittance.&nbsp; Perfect for your needs. But, Chris and Dana would have
    to stop pocketing the money from the tshirts for a while.

<p><strong>Straight up</strong>:&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t tell you now where future After Parties will be.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t name the venue.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s <em>all your fault!</em></p>
<p>Well, not all.&nbsp; some if it&rsquo;s my fault, but in a very innocent way.</p>
<p><strong>Planning The After Party</strong></p>
<p>Eisenhower said that planning is essential, but plans are useless.&nbsp; He was right.</p>
<p>When we were planning <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/category/the-after-party/" target="_blank">The After Party</a>, we figured about 50, maybe 75,&nbsp; people would attend at each one.&nbsp; We based this on a few factors, including some surveying of interest and attendance as last year&rsquo;s Thursday Night Throwdowns.</p>
<p>We were wrong, if by &ldquo;We&rdquo; you mean &ldquo;Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I was wrong.&nbsp; Others warned, but I didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say I screwed up, though.</p>
<p><strong>What Happened?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/overflow-drink.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11243" title="overflow drink" src="http://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/overflow-drink-282x300.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="300" /></a>Well, over 100 people showed up.&nbsp; And more will show up on October 20.&nbsp; And more after that.</p>
<p>So our plan of rotating through great St. Louis restaurants is all shot to hell. Most restaurants can&rsquo;t accommodate groups our size.</p>
<p>Plus, we can&rsquo;t afford to rent a hall big enough for all of us, unless some angel comes through with an After Party grant to help us continue our mission (hint).</p>
<p>So Michelle Moore and others are busily at work trying to find a solution.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll need space for more than 100 in October and November, and more than that in future months.</p>
<p>If you can help with a donation, please click below.&nbsp; If you can help with venues, please send an email to <a href="mailto:admin@stlouisteaparty.com">admin@stlouisteaparty.com</a> using the<strong> subject line: After Party Venues<em>. </em></strong><em>(You must use After Party Venues </em>in the subject line, or it won&rsquo;t get to the people who need it.)</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p>You overwhelmed the system, you Cloward-Piven wannabes,&nbsp; with your desire to fix America.&nbsp; You are champions.&nbsp; You are heroes.&nbsp; Society owes you a big thank you.&nbsp; On behalf of that grateful nation, let me be the first to say Thank You for accepting the challenge of a generation.&nbsp; Again.</p>
