    an a priori decision has been made to discriminate against any Muslim in his administration.
    I am a non-Muslim American whose family migrated to the US from Lebanon after
    a violent anti-Christian period in that country and know that some Muslims can
    justify violent action against "infidels" like religious Christians. I would hope
    a discriminating vetting process, assuming some type of security clearance, might
    satisfy his premonition that all Muslims mean to harm the country. '

<p>That&rsquo;s okay because <strong>America <em>loves</em> an underdog. </strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what must happen <em>right now</em> for Herman Cain to win:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>Social Media</strong> avalanche.&nbsp; Get @THEHermanCain trending on Twitter, and keep it there for five consecutive days. How?&nbsp; Simple. Use Hootsuite (or similar tool) to schedule <em>original</em> tweets about Herman Cain, with a shortened link to his site (<a title="http://bit.ly/r19euz" href="http://bit.ly/r19euz">http://bit.ly/r19euz</a>) and his Twitter handle (@THEHermanCain).&nbsp; Send 2 original tweets per day&mdash;one in the morning, one in the evening.&nbsp; Post about Herman Cain, with link to his site (<a title="http://bit.ly/r19euz" href="http://bit.ly/r19euz">http://bit.ly/r19euz</a>) on Facebook every other day (no more). (For more tips on effective social media campaigning, get my $1.99 ebook &ldquo;<a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Weaving-Roots/?isbn=9780062112965" target="_blank">Weaving the Roots</a>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <strong>Bloggers</strong> posting human stories about why Florida voters picked Cain.&nbsp; Real stories like <a href="http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/article/how-cain-won-florida" target="_blank">this one from Byron York</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I liked Cain, but I wasn't sure he could win," said Zena, from Washington County.&nbsp; "But after I heard this, I thought it doesn't matter if he wins or not -- I am for this man. He was awesome."</p></blockquote>
<p>Or this one from the same York piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I couldn't make up my mind," said Thelma, from Panama City, after the vote.&nbsp; "It was the speech that made the hair stand up on my arms.&nbsp; It wasn't a tingle down my leg -- it was an emotional excitement that this man knows how to get our country out of trouble."</p></blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; <strong>Add a link</strong> to Herman Cain&rsquo;s official website to your email signature. This is a powerful tool that everyone who sends emails can use.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <strong>Attend a local event</strong>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll need to sign up for email blasts from the Cain campaign (<a title="http://bit.ly/r19euz" href="http://bit.ly/r19euz">http://bit.ly/r19euz</a>) and read them. But don&rsquo;t just read them. Forward important ones to 5 friends.&nbsp; (Only important ones. Don&rsquo;t spam the undecided.)</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <strong>Donate Money</strong>.&nbsp; I know conservatives and independents hate the idea of money in politics. Without money, Cain cannot compete.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say it again:&nbsp; without millions of small donations, Herman Cain will lose.&nbsp; Of all five must-do actions on this list, this is the most important.&nbsp; Give whatever you can, then tell the world, &ldquo;I just donated to Herman Cain online <a title="http://bit.ly/r19euz" href="http://bit.ly/r19euz">http://bit.ly/r19euz</a>."</p>
<p>In 2008, the Republicans nominated John McCain&mdash;an echo.&nbsp; In 1996, Republicans nominated Bob Dole&mdash;an echo.&nbsp; In 1988, 2000, and 2004 Republicans nominated echoes. (Did I say &ldquo;Republicans?&rdquo;&nbsp; I meant king-makers.)</p>
<p>If you want to make a difference&mdash;and blow Obama out of the water in November 2012&mdash;don&rsquo;t give the American voter an echo&mdash;give him a choice.</p>
<p>While the Republican presidential field has many good men an women in its ranks, as do many Congressional and state races across the country, most candidates are corporate-sponsored echoes of big government and crony capitalism.</p>
<p><strong>Our grassroots movement has come too far to return now to business as usual.</strong></p>
<p>Last night, I had the rare and wonderful honor of introducing <a href="http://www.eagleforum.org/misc/bio.html" target="_blank">Phyllis Schlafly</a> at a fundraiser for <a href="http://edmartinforcongress.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a>.&nbsp; Mrs. Schlafly sits in the conservative pantheon with William F. Buckley, Ronald Reagan, Russell Kirk, and Barry Goldwater.&nbsp; Her 1964 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0686114868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0686114868">A Choice Not an Echo: The inside story of how American Presidents are chosen</a><img style="margin: 0px; border-style: none !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0686114868&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, laid the blueprint for Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s near-miss in 1976 and victory in 1980.</p>
<p>In 2012, the GOP can give Americans a choice, or it can destroy itself with mere echoes.&nbsp; At this moment in history, there is no third way.</p>
