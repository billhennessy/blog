<p>The daily news about Joplin has faded.</p>
<p><a href="http://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ap_Joplin_Tornado_jt_110528_wg.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11317" title="ap_Joplin_Tornado_jt_110528_wg" src="http://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ap_Joplin_Tornado_jt_110528_wg.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>The turmoil remains.</p>
<p>The list of desperately needed items is shorter, but the need is more acute than ever.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>If you can, please bring NEW items for Joplin to <strong>Sky Music Lounge Thursday, November 17, between 7 and 10 pm</strong>.<br />
<strong>Please bring ONLY items on this list</strong>.&nbsp; Rob Brenner will make sure they get where they're desperately needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Space Heaters</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Canned Goods</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Cleaning Supplies</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Blankets</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these should be NEW items in their original packaging.&nbsp; Rob will shuttle the items shortly after the After Party on the 17th.&nbsp; You may donate without staying for The After Party.</p>
<p>Our continued thanks and appreciation to Rob Brenner for his yeoman efforts in Joplin after months of work in Alabama. &nbsp;Rob would love nothing more than for us to overload him with kindness on Thursday.</p>
<p>P.S. You do not have to be a Tea Partier to help out.</p>
