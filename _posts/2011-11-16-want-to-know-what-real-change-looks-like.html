<p>Have you known anyone who turned his life around?</p>
<p>I was in New York last week. Every day I was there, I passed hundreds of people. Each day, I met a dozen new friends.&nbsp; Everyone in New York, it seems, is ready to smile and have a conversation.</p>
<p>I thought about some of these people-- the young couple holding hands, the young man with a hoodie a dozen tattoos, the two models (I was in <em>that</em> part of town) sitting in the hotel lobby talking on their cell phones. I thought about their lives, their secrets, the stuff they wish the whole world knew about them, and the stuff they'd just as soon forget.</p>
<p>I thought about redemption.&nbsp; About how many people we meet have overcome their own weaknesses.&nbsp; We're lucky to have them among us.</p>
<p>I also though about the people who life has kicked in the gut, but they get up and move on.&nbsp; From them, we learn a lot.</p>
<p>The redeemed.&nbsp; The survivors.&nbsp; They make our society stronger. That WWII generation was great because it was full of people who overcame a lot and kept on growing.</p>
<p>Imagine if we could somehow help a whole community to overcome the nasty hand its been dealt, or its self-inflicted wounds. Wouldn't it be great to see a desolate neighborhood, a broken city, a dangerous street turned around?</p>
<p>Imagine how powerful, how much hope and strength and joy, would come from a whole community surging toward relative peace and prosperity after decades of decline.</p>
<p>What if we could unleash an upward spiral of positivity for thousands of people at once?</p>
<p><strong>We Can</strong></p>

Baker, candidate for U.S. House of Representatives</a> from Missouri's 1st District knows his district, its people, and its problems.</p>
<p>He also knows that doing more of what's been done for the past 60 years won't make the 1st District any better.&nbsp; Martin has the courage to make a change.</p>
<p>I believe that Martin's district needs a new direction. I know that Martin Baker combines rare strength, courage, and commitment to begin that change.</p>
<p>I urge you to<a href="http://martinbakerforcongress.com/"> visit this website today</a>.&nbsp; Visit every day and pray.&nbsp; Ask for discernment.&nbsp; Ask for help. Don't be afraid.</p>
<p>If you can, invest in our future.&nbsp; Help Martin Baker overcome the decades of damage wrought by Lacy and Bill Clay. Help restore our community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not us, who?</p>
<p>If not now, when?</p>
