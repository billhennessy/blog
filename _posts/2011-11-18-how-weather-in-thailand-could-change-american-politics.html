<p>Just over a decade ago, a little lightning in New Mexico upended the cell phone business. Nature, not government, picked winners and losers. &nbsp;That storm determined the cell phone device race until another dynamo, the iPhone, came along and changed everything again.</p>
<p>Now, weather in Thailand--and the tsunami in Japan--threaten to upend American politics in the 2012. &nbsp;Your economic future could hang in the balance.</p>
<h2>Nokia vs. Ericsson, 2001</h2>
<p>The <a href="about:blank">Wall Street Journal story</a> spellbound me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Caused by a lightning bolt, the blaze in an Albuquerque, N.M., semiconductor plant burned for just 10 minutes last March. But far away in Scandinavia, the fire touched off a corporate crisis that shifted the balance of power between two of Europe's biggest electronics companies, both major players in the global electronics industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>How could that happen? In 2001, how could a tiny fire have such an amazing impact on the fastest-growing industry in the world? &nbsp;And how could Asian weather this year change American politics in 2012 and beyond?</p>
<p>In March, 2001, Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland were locked in a battle. Each wanted to dominate the cell phone market just as cell phone sales skyrocketed around the world.</p>
<p>Both manufacturers bought a key radio frequency chip from the same chip supplier in New Mexico. &nbsp;The difference: &nbsp;Ericsson relied solely on the New Mexico plant, while Nokia worked with multiple suppliers.</p>
<h2>Thailand Floods Dry Up Hard Drives</h2>
<p>Central planners consider efficiency the supreme objective. &nbsp;Hitler&rsquo;s Final Solution was, in his mind, an efficiency project, as were<a href="http://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/western-digital-flood-300x225.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="western-digital-flood-300x225" src="http://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/western-digital-flood-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Stalin&rsquo;s&nbsp;collectivization&nbsp;atrocities. &nbsp;Efficiency pays no regard to right or wrong--only to minimum cost in time and material to accomplish some objective.</p>
<p>Efficiency is often the enemy of safety and common sense. The drive to reduce &ldquo;waste&rdquo; often increases risk by putting lots of eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>Ericsson&rsquo;s one-source solution was efficient. &nbsp;So efficient that by the end of 2001, Ericsson abandoned the cell phone market it nearly dominated in March of the same year.</p>
<p>Likewise, the United States has shipped hard drive manufacturing to Thailand. &nbsp;More efficient. &nbsp;Thailand has the plants and the labor force to produce more drives faster and cheaper than American manufacturers.</p>
<p>Until it rains. A lot.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s monsoon season ravaged Thailand. &nbsp;Flood waters fill over 1,000 factories in the central part of the country (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/business/global/07iht-floods07.html?pagewanted=all">source NYT)</a>.</p>
<p>Best Buy customers already feel the impact.</p>
<p>St. Louisan Lee Presser tried to buy a new hard drive for his wifes computer this week. The price was double what he&rsquo;d expected.</p>
<p>Lee went home to shop around on the internet. There he found prices even higher than those at Best Buy. &nbsp;So he returned to buy the last hard drive in stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Geek Squad guy told me it was because of flooding in Thailand,&rdquo; Lee told me.</p>
<p>Prices for the most popular specifications have <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/103711-hdd-pricewatch-you-know-where-its-going-we-tell-you-how-much-its-going-to-hurt">nearly doubled since November 1</a>.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Jack Welch and Automation</h2>
<p>Lee continued, &ldquo;Which reminded me of that thing Jack Welch said.&rdquo; &nbsp;Lee referred to the former CEO of General Electric.</p>
<p>Mr. Presser had seen Welch in an interview talking about the problem automation has presented to the job market. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t need that many people to make products anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which brought Lee to his epiphany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So why can&rsquo;t make hard drives here in the United States? &nbsp;Why should we be dependent on a country in Asia when we can manufacture them right here with machines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great questions.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Answer</h2>
<p>There are many obvious answers to Lee&rsquo;s questions. &nbsp;To me, the most obvious is the long-term plan by the kingmakers to grow economies in underdeveloped countries. &nbsp;But that expensive policy of dubious return is fodder for another blog.</p>
<p>The answer that concerns us here is political, and comes as another question: &nbsp;How many candidates for any office care a lick about flooding in Thailand or lightning in New Mexico?</p>
<p>How many politicians really get how all this stuff works? &nbsp;How many really care?</p>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m afraid even some of our favorite Congressmen and candidates probably fell asleep before they got to this sentence. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s because many (if not most) politicians have thought little about purpose of American life. They think, instead, about getting elected.</p>
<p>Not life. &nbsp;Not biological or spiritual existence. But American life. &nbsp;About why and how what American life is.</p>
<p>Instead, the modern politician focuses on one thing: getting elected. &nbsp;They can&rsquo;t be distracted with Lee Presser&rsquo;s search for a hard drive unless thirty-one percent of registered voters of a particular party also want cheaper hard drives.</p>
<p>How many politicians ever ask the simple and profound question Lee asked rhetorically today: why can&rsquo;t we make hard drives in America?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be refreshing to meet a candidate who knows what he&rsquo;s going to do the day after his swearing-in.</p>
<h2>Challenge a Candidate</h2>
<p>As Tony Soprano would say, &ldquo;Wadda ya gonna do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I say: &nbsp;let&rsquo;s put candidates on the spot.</p>
<p>Not just candidates we&rsquo;re not sure about. &nbsp;Not just candidates we&rsquo;re uncomfortable with. &nbsp;And not just candidates from the dreaded other party.</p>
<p>Challenge our candidates. &nbsp;Our favorites.</p>
<p>At some point, we need to restore American pride. &nbsp;Becoming CEO of Conglomerated Widgets, Inc., does not end one&rsquo;s Americanism. &nbsp;Leading a company is no excuse for shirking duties to the nation that made one&rsquo;s career, built his company, and gave its customers the wealth with which to buy its widgets.</p>
<p>And today our candidates for office, from City Hall to Pennsylvania Avenue, owe us their attention to restoring American manufacturing.</p>
<p>Politicians owe us a clear message to multinational corporations that we are out of the business of subsidizing your operations. &nbsp;As states, we&rsquo;re done bribing you to stay here. &nbsp;As a people, we&rsquo;re done apologizing to the world for coming up with the best ideas again and again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to elevate the practice of politics beyond getting elected, just as it&rsquo;s time to elevate the practice of business above maximizing profits in the current fiscal quarter.</p>
<p>We built America for long-term success, sustainability, and prosperity. &nbsp;Arbitrary three-month spurts of greatness are not enough for us. They should satisfy no one.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s harness our grassroots energy. Let&rsquo;s use the tragic floods of Thailand, not to damage the Thai economy, but to rebuild our own.</p>
<p>We begin by making politicians talk about big ideas for which they may not have complete answers. It&rsquo;s okay if they don&rsquo;t. These are difficult questions, as most important questions are.</p>
<p>But we must be sure we&rsquo;re voting for people who know why, how, and what America was, is, and could be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why men and women run for office. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s an awesome responsibility.</p>
