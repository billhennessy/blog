<p>Some center-right people take their ball and go home. Guess who?</p>

<p>Since the 2010 election, we&rsquo;ve heard from the Establishment (GOP, MSM, DNC) that Tea Partiers are too puritanical. </p>
<p>The elitist theory holds that Tea Partiers demand doctrinaire allegiance to some engraved-granite list of principles.&nbsp; Stray from that list, and the Tea Party will hunt you down like a dog in the street and beat you with a Wiffle Ball bat until you pee blood for a week. </p>
<p>Guess what, though.<strong> It&rsquo;s not the Tea Partiers who defect when their candidates lose.</strong> </p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/58_of_gop_primary_voters_see_tea_party_as_a_plus_for_republicans_in_2012">Rasmussen poll</a> (subscription may be required) found that Establishment Republicans are far more likely to vote Democrat, third party, or not at all if their favored candidate loses a primary. </p>
<blockquote><p> Interestingly, those outside the Tea Party are more committed to finding a candidate who shares their views--67% of Tea Party members take that approach compared to 75% of non-members. That data <strong>contradicts a common story line that Tea Party members are interested in ideological purity</strong> while others are more practical in their considerations.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the divisions get even clearer when the questions get more specific:</p>
<blockquote><p> Again, those in the Tea Party are more committed to the GOP field than other primary voters. Ninety-one percent (91%) of Tea Party members now plan to vote for the eventual GOP candidate even if their first choice isn&rsquo;t the nominee, compared to 71% of non-members.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kidding?&nbsp; Non-Tea Party Republicans could see a 29 percent defection rate if their favorite candidate isn&rsquo;t nominated?&nbsp; Wow.</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you that the Tea Party is too puritanical, tell them, &ldquo;Perhaps, but we&rsquo;re not nearly as puritanical as the establishment Republicans.&rdquo;</p>
