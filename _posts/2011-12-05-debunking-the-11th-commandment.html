<p>The Gipper didn&rsquo;t always follow his own commandment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve appreciated Newt Gingrich&rsquo;s attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but it&rsquo;s been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama. </p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d be right.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But being right about that doesn&rsquo;t mean candidates don&rsquo;t have an obligation to show voters why they&rsquo;re preferable to their opponents. </p>
<p>Since Ronald Reagan handed down the 11th Commandment&mdash;thou shalt not speak ill of thy fellow Republicans&mdash;every Republican seems to hide behind it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk about the people I poisoned!&nbsp; It violates the 11th Commandment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First there&rsquo;s a practical problem with that approach.&nbsp; Some candidates have serious baggage that needs to be vetted. If a candidate doesn&rsquo;t disclose his or her potential issues, who will?&nbsp; </p>
<p>The press?&nbsp; Well, the press might, but only if the candidate with the baggage is to the left of the others. In other words, you&rsquo;ll hear about Romney&rsquo;s baggage only if his remaining opponents are to his left.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a theoretical problem with the 11th Commandment.&nbsp; Reagan blew it to smithereens in 1976. At least, Reagan violated the modern interpretation of the 11th Commandment. </p>
<p>In that year, Gerald Ford, a Republican, was struggling to hold together a party ravaged by Watergate. Ford, an Establishment Republican and good man, took over the White House after Richard Nixon resigned. </p>
<p>Reagan had just ended two wildly successful terms as governor of California.&nbsp; And Reagan was fed up with Ford&rsquo;s handling of the Soviet Union:</p>
<blockquote><p> Disgruntled with Ford&rsquo;s pursuit of d&eacute;tente with the Soviets, Ronald Reagan in 1975 decided to seek the seemingly impossible: to challenge the incumbent president from his own party, thereby breaking Reagan&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Eleventh Commandment:&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou Shall Not Speak Ill of Another Republican.&rdquo; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/219603/pair-history/paul-kengor">http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/219603/pair-history/paul-kengor</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing speaks more ill of another Republican than running for President against that Republican who already occupies the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Nor was Reagan mild in his attacks on Ford.</p>
<blockquote><p> Reagan hit d&eacute;tente so hard throughout the campaign that there was a consensus that President Ford stopped using the term because Reagan had made it a dirty word. So successful was Reagan that the New York Times, in a May 14, 1976, editorial titled &ldquo;Mr. Reagan&rsquo;s Veto,&rdquo; claimed that the former California governor had &ldquo;won something approaching veto power over the Ford Administration&rsquo;s foreign policy.&rdquo; As Reagan did, Ford dropped in the polls. In another editorial, titled, &ldquo;President Under Seige,&rdquo; The Times opined: &ldquo;Governor Reagan has become a credible candidate while President Ford has slipped from almost certain victor to underdog.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, Reagan even carried politics beyond the water&rsquo;s edge. He challenged Ford largely over foreign policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In reality, Reagan&rsquo;s 11th Commandment was far different from the modern wounded Republican&rsquo;s definition. </p>
<p>Reagan referred to personal attacks, like Pat Brown calling Reagan a dumb actor.&nbsp; Reagan never opposed airing of policy differences.&nbsp; And, based on his fury at a debate in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1980, campaign tactics were in play, too:</p>

<p>Never let blind allegiance to a misunderstood principle prevent the people from knowing their choices.&nbsp;</p>
