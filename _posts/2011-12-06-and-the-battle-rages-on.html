    November 2012? Are you kidding? I agree with everything you've written, but if you think the work of renewal and revival will end with the 2012 elections, you are naive. It took a long time to get into this mess, and it will take a generation (or more) to fix it.

    Along the way, we will have disagreements and set-backs. But I want my children and grandchildren to inherit the free country I was born into, and I'm in it for the long run - no matter how long that takes! I hope everyone else is as well.

<p>Sometimes the right path is the easy path.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then the alarm goes off, and we get up to face the world. </p>
<p>When we first met in February 2009, we set ourselves on a course. We dedicated ourselves to, in Buckley&rsquo;s words, stand athwart history, yelling &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; </p>
<p>But we promised ourselves and the world even more.&nbsp; We committed to reversing the neglect and abuse that&rsquo;s stained our liberty for more than half a century. </p>
<p>And we will advance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve battled through healthcare reform, the 2010 election, and the budget and debt battles of 2011.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We are three-quarters of the way home.&nbsp; And we are still advancing.</p>
<p>In action movies, it&rsquo;s about this point when you think hope is lost.&nbsp; The secret weapon falls into the wrong hands.&nbsp; An opponent thought vanquished re-emerges. The good guys have nowhere to turn. </p>
<p>But we know how the movie ends, don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; The bloodied and bruised heroes pull together.&nbsp; The villain makes a mistake.&nbsp; Good triumphs. Wounded, perhaps, but victorious.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2012, we will hoist the flag of liberty over this republic once again.&nbsp; Every person&mdash;every single human&mdash;who&rsquo;s so much as tweeted, &ldquo;God bless America&rdquo; for this cause will share in that triumph. </p>
<p>This is your moment to shine, patriots.&nbsp; This is your moment. </p>
<p>Thank you, in advance, for answering the call. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you on the 15th.</p>
