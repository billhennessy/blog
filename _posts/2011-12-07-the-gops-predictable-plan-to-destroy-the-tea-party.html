<p>Yes, the establishment wants you to go away.</p>
<p>Are you going to obey?</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/politifact_photos_debate.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="politifact_photos_debate" border="0" alt="politifact_photos_debate" align="right" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/politifact_photos_debate_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="163"/></a></p>
<p>With a little help from <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/10/gop-empires-plan-crush-tea-party-rebels/43582/">The Atlantic and New York Times</a> (of all places), we can put together a strategy to recognize and deflect the establishment&rsquo;s tactics.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Put this in your back pocket. You&rsquo;ll need it before primary season is over.</p>
<p><strong>Establishment Tactic 1:&nbsp; Never admit membership in the establishment</strong></p>
<p>How To Handle: Never argue about what he establishment is.&nbsp; Instead, demand super-specific policies that the establishment would hate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you must oppose TARP and Stimulus. Could I get a quote from you for my blog?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Establishment Tactic 2:&nbsp; Kill the Tea Party with kindness</strong></p>
<p>How To Handle:&nbsp; Whenever someone praises you, thank them.&nbsp; But if you suspect an ulterior motive, there probably is. Again, demand specificity:&nbsp; &ldquo;What would your legislation to unwind Social Security look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Establishment Tactic 3:&nbsp; Push Candidates to the Left</strong></p>
<p>How to Handle:&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve heard it before&mdash;run to the base in the primary and to the middle in the general.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a fan of strict pledges that opponents can use to bludgeon a candidate. But letting the Billy Longs of the world lie their way to Washington to turn left is no way to save the republic.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Hold out the third party threat.&nbsp; Hand wobbly nominees a pair of flip-flops at a meet-and-greet.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll get the message.</p>
<p><strong>Establishment Tactic 4:&nbsp; Make compromise a moral imperative</strong></p>
<p>How to Handle:&nbsp; A conservative once lamented that if the Democrats sponsored legislation to burn the capitol to the ground, Republicans would offer an amendment to phase the fire in over three weeks. </p>
<p>To combat&nbsp; this tactic, point out the folly of the idea. If you&rsquo;re in debt up to your eyeballs, borrowing half as much as you&rsquo;d like to doesn&rsquo;t make you better off.&nbsp; Sometimes, reversal, not compromise, is the right thing. </p>
<p><strong>Establishment Tactic 5:&nbsp; Take the GOP ball and go home</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://hennessysview.com/miscellaneous/guess-who-the-puritans-are/">I pointed out in a previous post</a>, the establishment is more prone than activists to defect when it doesn&rsquo;t get its way.&nbsp; Let them.&nbsp; When Republicans say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s our party, not yours,&rdquo; smile and nod.&nbsp; Then run for low-level party position.&nbsp; Get your friends to do the same.&nbsp; Show up at township and central committee meetings.&nbsp; Reagan&rsquo;s forces took over the GOP in short order.&nbsp; Tea Partiers can too. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus Point:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t Become the Establishment</strong></p>
<p>Actually, you can&rsquo;t really avoid that. But remember&mdash;new insurgents are born every day.&nbsp; Someday you&rsquo;ll be viewed at the powerful interest seeking to exclude the stamp-licking rabble.&nbsp; Be careful how you use your power and influence. </p>
