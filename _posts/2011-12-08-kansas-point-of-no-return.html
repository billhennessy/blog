<p>Tuesday in Kansas, President Barack Obama revealed his contempt for liberty. He declared that human beings are incapable of running their own lives . . . but, somehow, other, superior human beings are capable of running their own and others&rsquo;. </p>
<p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://ridgeliner7.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/obama_marxist_logo.jpg"/></p>
<p>He said that free markets have always failed, everywhere . . . ignoring most of the last 240 years.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He all but declared himself a Marxist. </p>
<p>I am depressed that America let this dangerous man into our government. </p>
<p>There are so many things to be done. So many. </p>
<p>But our president hates this country.&nbsp; His speech on Tuesday was a point of no return for him and for us. We are the only people who can fix it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s clear our plates and our minds.&nbsp; We have 11 months until the most important presidential election of our lives.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not blow it.</p>
