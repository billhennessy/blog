<blockquote> <em>Gloria in excelsis Deo. Et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The English version of the&nbsp; Roman Catholic Missal changed at the start of Advent. The new translation is truer to the Latin original.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/latin_mass.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="latin_mass" border="0" alt="latin_mass" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/latin_mass_thumb.jpg" width="562" height="422"/></a></p>
<p>The response to &ldquo;The Lord be with you,&rdquo; change to &ldquo;And with your spirit&rdquo; from &ldquo;and also with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Latin, <em>et cum spiritu tuo</em> translates exactly into &ldquo;and with your spirit.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Another change that thrills conservative Catholics, is the consecration.&nbsp; For decades, we&rsquo;ve complained that the <em>Novo Ordo</em> was wrong when it said, &ldquo;It will be shed for you and for all . . . &ldquo;&nbsp; The correct translation from Sumerian would be &ldquo;It will be shed for you and for many . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some Catholics believed that the erroneous translation to &ldquo;all&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;many&rdquo; prevented <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05573a.htm">transubstantiation</a>&mdash;the bread and wine being the body and blood of Christ. This correction brings great relief to many.</p>
<p>My favorite correction, though, won&rsquo;t be heard until Christmas.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A song in the mass, the Gloria, goes away during Advent, the time Christian&rsquo;s prepare for the celebration of Christ&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; In the Gloria is a subtle but profound correction that carries meaning to Catholics and to the whole world.</p>
<p>For years we&rsquo;ve heard that the angel who appeared to the shepherds declared, &ldquo;Peace on earth and good will to men.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But that translation lacks accuracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace on earth and to men of good will,&rdquo; is the correct interpretation.</p>
<p>When the Novo Ordo Missal was prepared, church leaders chose openness over accuracy. &ldquo;All&rdquo; sounds more inclusive than &ldquo;many.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace on earth and good will to men,&rdquo; covers everyone, not just the good and faithful. The result, though, muddled theology and scripture. </p>
<p>The lesson here is important: words have meaning. </p>
<p>When we use the wrong words in order to soften our message, we usually succeed.&nbsp; But if we soften our message enough, we lose the meaning of the message intended.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say we should put a sharp edge on our speech or treat sensitive subjects callously. Instead, we use language and actions necessary and proper in the most loving way we can.</p>
<p>The angel and Christ used words of exclusion: many, not all, and men of good will.&nbsp; But the invitation was universal: all may choose to be saved.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Glory to God in the highest. And on earth peace to men of good will.</em></p>
</blockquote>
