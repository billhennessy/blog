<p>The Washington Post&rsquo;s headline writer made a common mistake on Sunday.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Apologist-Romney.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Apologist-Romney" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Apologist-Romney_thumb.png" alt="Apologist-Romney" width="512" height="251" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>He confused &ldquo;one who apologizes&rdquo; with &ldquo;apologist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An easy mistake, no doubt, for most of us. Professional headline writers should know better. So should Glenn Kessler, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romneys-claim-that-obama-is-an-apologist-for-us-is-based-on-distortions/2011/12/01/gIQAdDpXlO_story.html">the author of the WP story</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The claim that Obama is an apologist for the nation began to take shape shortly after he became president.</p></blockquote>
<p>An <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apologist">apologist</a> is &ldquo;one who speaks or writes in defense of someone or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Britannica.com describes <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30100/Apologist">an apologist</a> as:</p>
<blockquote><p>any of the Christian writers, primarily in the 2nd century, who attempted to provide a defense of Christianity and criticisms of Greco-Roman culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Romney does not accuse Obama of being an apologist for the United States; he accuses the president, accurately, of <em>apologizing for </em>the United States.</p>
<p>To anyone who knows the meaning of the words, Kessler&rsquo;s story reads like a farce.&nbsp; Kessler attempts to demonstrate that Obama does not apologize the U.S., but, in fact, he defends his country.&nbsp; But Kessler uses the wrong words.</p>
<p>Making Kessler&rsquo;s sin even more egregious, he writes at the Post&rsquo;s fact checker&mdash;a fact checker who failed to look up the meaning of &ldquo;apologist,&rdquo; the central word of his story.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote about the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/other-news/men-of-good-will-and-other-changes/">importance of precise words</a>. Lord knows I&rsquo;m as guilty of letting my precision wane as is Kessler or anyone else.</p>
<p>Still, I will accept the title of &ldquo;American Apologist&rdquo; proudly.&nbsp; And, while I disagree with Kessler&rsquo;s intended meaning, I do agree with the literal assertion of his story: Barack Obama is no apologist for the United States.</p>
