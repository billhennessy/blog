<p>The middle of the road is fine until you have to get somewhere.</p>
<p>I voted for Bob Dole in 1996. Yet his nomination drove me away from political activism for years.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/middle-of-road1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="middle-of-road" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/middle-of-road_thumb1.jpg" alt="middle-of-road" width="591" height="395" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I got out of the Navy in the fall of 1994. I watched the GOP reclaim the House with my nephew, Scott.&nbsp; I expected the Republicans to nominate a solid conservative who deliver a knock-out blow to the Clinton era two years later.</p>
<p>Instead, they nominated Bob Dole.</p>
<p>I quit. Gave up.&nbsp; Surrendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Republicans want to nominated a &lsquo;me too&rsquo; Republican,&rdquo; I told friends, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no point in my wasting time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a bit petulant of me. Then, again, I&rsquo;d been through a lot personally. Maybe I needed a break.</p>
<p>But Bob Dole?</p>
<p>In 1996, Bob Dole was the symbol of the GOP establishment. To Reaganites, he was a living reminder of the low-point of the Gipper&rsquo;s two terms: the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1996/08/the_biggest_tax_increase_in_history.html" target="_blank">1982 tax increase</a>. As a politician, he was the worst of both worlds: an acerbic, sarcastic humor that turned off moderates and moderate deal-making politics that turned off everybody else.</p>
<p>I caucused, that year, for Pat Buchanan.</p>
<p>Buchanan had and has many flaws.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;d have wiped up the stage with Clinton at debates. Even if he&rsquo;d lost to Clinton, he&rsquo;d have forced Bill to move ten steps to the right.&nbsp; Dole, on the other hand, brought a record that closely followed Clinton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Republican Established told us in 96 that only a moderate could win. We needed to nominate someone who could reach across the aisle and do business with the Democrats. Someone who would appeal to the Generation Xers.</p>
<p>So they nominated deal-maker, aisle-crosser, tax-hiker Bob Dole.</p>
<p>In December of 1996, Clinton was smoking cigars in the Oval Office as <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/bob-dole-released-back-into-wild,1057/" target="_blank">Bob Dole was released into the wild</a>.</p>
<p>To those who remember, who were in the trenches with the Buchanan Brigades in our fight against the GOP establishment, 2012 is looking&nbsp; a lot like 1996.</p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;re coming off historic wins in the off-year election.&nbsp; Once again, we&rsquo;re dealing with a GOP field of candidates that lacks a viable, solid conservative. Once again, the establishment wants us to vote for the echo candidate.</p>
<p>In 1996, the echo was Bob &ldquo;It&rsquo;s My Turn&rdquo; Dole.&nbsp; In 2012, it&rsquo;s Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>Look, if Romney gets the nomination, I&rsquo;ll vote for the guy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll work to help him defeat President Obama, because I believe that Romney would be better than Obama. The Supreme Court, alone, is reason to support any Republican over just about any Democrat.</p>
<p>But Romney won&rsquo;t stir up the passions of the Tea Party base. He&rsquo;ll remind older conservatives of Bob Dole, and he&rsquo;ll remind <a href="http://hennessysview.com/living/friday-happy-hour-for-march-11-2011/" target="_blank">Millennials</a> of the guy who laid off their dad.</p>
<p>Bob Dole, like Mitt Romney, is too close to the middle of the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. After I wrote this post, Bob Dole endorsed Mitt Romney. &nbsp;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/bob-dole-endorses-romney-republican-nominee-160230105.html">Surprise</a>!</p>
