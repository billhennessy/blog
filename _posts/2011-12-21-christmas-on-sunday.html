    with stick figures drawn in mud and eat raw meat. Luckily I'm never gone for more
    than a day or two! I hear the Mass at St. Francis is inspiring.....God Bless you
    and yours, Merry Christmas!

<p>When I was a kid, I loved Christmas on Sundays. What I hated were the years before and after the Sunday Christmas.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Our_Mother_of_Perpetual_Help1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Our_Mother_of_Perpetual_Help[1]" border="0" alt="Our_Mother_of_Perpetual_Help[1]" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Our_Mother_of_Perpetual_Help1_thumb.jpg" width="199" height="244"/></a></p>
<p>My problem was I didn&rsquo;t want to go to Mass two days in a row.</p>
<p>To give some background, I grew up in a Catholic home.&nbsp; Very Catholic.&nbsp; My dad went to Epiphany. My mom&rsquo;s Catholic, and her dad converted very late in life.&nbsp; Two of my dad&rsquo;s cousins were Monsignors. Our most treasured piece of art was a Mother of Perpetual Help painting by my aunt Mame.&nbsp; Before every meal we said, in unison:</p>
<p>Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>Every meal.</p>
<p>Despite all this great Catholic upbringing, daily Mass&mdash;even two days out of seven&mdash;seemed like punishment. </p>
<p>In this, I believe, I was the perfect American male.</p>
<p>True or not, our cultural image of the Wild West involves lawless, wild men tamed by Bible-beating women. Not that American men are bad by nature, but left to our own devices, we&rsquo;ll build a saloon and a house for women who go well with whiskey before we build a church and recruit a preacher.</p>
<p>But when the women folk show up, preacher in tow, we heel.&nbsp; And we heal. </p>
<p>In our wildness, we wound ourselves and others.&nbsp; Perhaps not physically, but wounds we open. </p>
<p>Years later, we appreciate the civilizing effect of church. </p>
<p>At 48, I no longer dread Mass.&nbsp; I look forward to Midnight Mass this year, and I&rsquo;ll try to talk the family into making the trek to St. Francis de Sales for its heavenly Midnight Mass.</p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m no better a person now than I was when two Masses in one week tortured me, I&rsquo;ve come to understand that God&rsquo;s inconveniences are not obstacles but express ways: the pain perfects us. </p>
<p>This year, Christmas is on a Sunday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about that.</p>
