<p>I live in a very hilly area. Yet I&rsquo;m still alive. Explain that.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a lower-case &ldquo;r&rdquo; republican and not an upper-case one. </p>
<p>Republicans seem to feel every hill is worth dying on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What else could explain the House&rsquo;s rejection of a silly payroll tax cut extension followed by a doubly-damaging capitulation?</p>
<p>By &ldquo;silly,&rdquo; I mean ill-advised, inconsequential, irrational, and fiscally irresponsible.&nbsp; The Senate&rsquo;s two-month extension of the Social Security tax cut represents the worst of Washington. </p>
<p>And the GOP House just signed off on it, caving to pressure from the White House and media. </p>
<p>In the chess match of public relations, the extension was golden. The press trumpeted it as a victory for the little guy that only the most cynical, hateful bastards on earth could oppose. </p>
<p>The GOP could have eked out a tiny PR win by denouncing the Senate&rsquo;s cynicism in passing a meaningless and destructive bill by lying to people about its benefits.&nbsp; Then quietly pass the stupid thing, and leave on Christmas break.</p>
<p>Instead, the House GOP stepped up to the microphone and announced, &ldquo;Well, we are cynical, hateful bastards, and we&rsquo;d be happy to oppose it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having taken the black eye for opposing a tax cut for the little guy, the GOP could have shown some muscle by sticking it out.&nbsp; They could have said, &ldquo;The Constitution places power to tax and spend with the House, Mr. President. You might be willing to compromise your principles, but we are not.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sure, the press would call them cynical, hateful bastards.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;d at least be resolute, firm,and committed.</p>
<p>But they caved.&nbsp; The pressure got to be too much.&nbsp; Or Christmas spirit overwhelmed them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One way or another, the House Republicans took a black eye and got nothing for it. </p>
<p>Yes, the Tea Party&rsquo;s core principles are Constitutionally limited government, fiscal responsibility, and free markets.&nbsp; This extension fails the middle one. </p>
<p>But we have a much longer vision than two months.&nbsp; Our goal is to stop and reverse the illicit growth of government power, growth that requires fiscal irresponsibility,and power that consumes human freedom.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Our mission requires more than one election cycle. Dying on on this particular hill didn&rsquo;t advance our fight&mdash;it set us back. </p>
<p>Moral of the story: win every battle you fight, but don&rsquo;t fight any battle unless it&rsquo;s a strategic necessity.&nbsp;</p>
