<p>We know <a href="http://hennessysview.com/living/the-ghost-of-christmas-yet-to-come/" target="_blank">how the story ends</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p> "What's to-day!" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.
<p>"EH?" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder. </p>
<p>"What's to-day, my fine fellow?" said Scrooge. </p>
<p>"To-day!" replied the boy. "Why, CHRISTMAS DAY." </p>
<p>"It's Christmas Day!" said Scrooge to himself. "I haven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--<em>Dickens, Charles (2004-08-11). A Christmas Carol (p. 68). Public Domain Books. Kindle Edition. </em></p>

<p>The Spirits can do anything they like.</p>

<p>And we are the spirits. Our future is in our hands. </p>
<p>Christmas Day reminds us that we can be redeemed. All we&rsquo;ve squandered and wasted, all of our sins of omission and commission, can be forgiven.</p>
<p>The consequences remain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s good news, still. The cumulative pain of debt stops increasing when we stop borrowing.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true whether we&rsquo;re talking about borrowing money or borrowing good will. </p>
<p>And we know how the story ends. </p>
<blockquote><p> In the midst of the street thereof, and on both sides of the river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits every month: the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations. </p>
<p>And there shall be no curse any more: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it. And his servants shall serve him. And they shall see his face: and his name shall be on their foreheads. </p>
<p>And night shall be no more. And they shall not need the light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God shall enlighten then. And they shall reign for ever and ever. </p>
<p>. . . Behold, I come quickly: and my reward is with me, to render to every, man according to his works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Christmas Carol ended similarly:</p>
<blockquote><p> [A]nd it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!</p></blockquote>

<p>Merry Christmas.&nbsp;</p>
