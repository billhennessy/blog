<p>I&rsquo;m almost finished reading Walter Isaacson&rsquo;s biography of Apple co-founder and genius Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Jobs&rsquo;s life left insanely good lessons. Some lessons instruct us on how to do things. Others warn us of bad things to avoid.</p>
<p>One of the good things Steve Jobs taught us:&nbsp; focus.&nbsp; Maniacal focus on things that mattered, and a pathological aversion to distractions.</p>
<p>One example.&nbsp; When Jobs returned to Apple after 10-year exile, he took stock of all the projects underway.&nbsp; He found dozens of development and research efforts.&nbsp; Most of them were, in his words, &ldquo;shit.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>The product review revealed how unfocused Apple had become. The company was churning out multiple versions of each product because of bureaucratic momentum and to satisfy the whims of retailers. &ldquo;It was insanity,&rdquo; Schiller recalled. &ldquo;Tons of products, most of them crap, done by deluded teams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--Isaacson, Walter (2011-10-24). Steve Jobs (p. 337). Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jobs killed 70 percent of those products.</p>
<p>Jobs was famously direct, blunt, rude. When people on an Apple product team heard Steve Jobs call their work &ldquo;shit,&rdquo; it stung. Not only that, the project cancellations put people&rsquo;s jobs in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Finally, Jobs gave one of the insulted teams a great reason for his harsh assessment of their work.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are bright people,&rdquo; he told one group. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be wasting your time on such crappy products.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--Isaacson, Walter (2011-10-24). Steve Jobs (p. 337). Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>To help the people focus, he drew a simple diagram on a whiteboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/01/01/a-maniacal-focus-for-2012/jobsproductquadrant_thumb-300x196/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-12988"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12988" alt="JobsProductQuadrant_thumb-300x196" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jobsproductquadrant_thumb-300x196.jpg" width="300" height="196" /></a></p>
<p>From dozens of projects, the new Apple would focus on only four, one for each quadrant in this simple drawing.</p>
<p>I know a lot of bright people who get lost in a sea of good ideas. We&rsquo;re taught from birth to look for opportunities everywhere, to never tell others &ldquo;no&rdquo; when they ask us to pitch in and help.</p>
<p>But if you say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to every good idea, you&rsquo;ll never ship the great ones.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in New Years&rsquo; resolutions, but I do believe in using milestones as checkpoints. And the start of a new calendar year is as good checkpoint as any. So here&rsquo;s my focus for 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual</strong>: Say the Rosary every day.</p>
<p><strong>Work</strong>: Create one insanely great new thing in 2012, all the way to market.</p>
<p><strong>Civic</strong>: Through <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/category/the-after-party/" target="_blank">The After Party</a> program, begin a new era of effective citizenship in St. Louis</p>
<p><strong>Family</strong>:&nbsp; Be present in the precious little time I spend at home</p>
<p>Four areas of life. One focus for each.</p>
<p>None of these is new. But reading the Jobs biography reminded me that it&rsquo;s critically important to remain focused.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ve deviated from Jobs&rsquo;s two-customer model. For good or ill, my life includes four customer types, each holding a warrantee that I must honor.</p>
