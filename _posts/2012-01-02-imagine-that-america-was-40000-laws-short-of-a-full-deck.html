<p>Until the clock struck twelve on January 1, that is. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when 40,000 &ndash; count &lsquo;em, <em>forty thousand</em>&mdash;new laws took effect in the United States. </p>
<p>Some of the new laws are, no doubt, good and proper. Some restore liberties lost. But others bind. And some are silly. </p>
<p>Utah&rsquo;s banning happy hours.&nbsp; (Why not ban melancholy hours instead?) California now prohibits people 18 and under from using tanning beds.&nbsp; Georgia requires golf carts to have turn signals and horns if driven on public roads.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In a cruel joke, many states are raising the minimum wage, making <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/battered-downturn-young-americans-put-off-adulthood-160406776.html">millions of unemployed young people</a> feel like they&rsquo;re missing out on even more.</p>
<p>Logically, after more than 230 years of legislating, you&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;d be just about done making laws, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Someone suggested that we stop calling people in legislatures &ldquo;law makers,&rdquo; hoping they&rsquo;d stop assuming their job requires new laws. I&rsquo;m starting to agree.</p>
<p>Some families have a rule about new things: for every new thing that comes into the home, something else must go out.&nbsp; Get a new toy, pick an old one to donate. New suit? Old suit to Salvation Army.</p>
<p>The idea is to live within some parameters, to avoid the accumulation of crap. The practice is a bit tough for most of us to follow, until the <a href="http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/">producer of Hoarders</a><em></em> knocks on the door and asks if you&rsquo;d like to be a TV star. </p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time we pass one more law in Jefferson City and Washington: for each new law, you must sunset another.&nbsp; </p>
