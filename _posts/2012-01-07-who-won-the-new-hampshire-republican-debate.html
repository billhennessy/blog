    Actually, on that measure, Huntsman did better.

    Remember, Santorum accused Dr. Paul of knowingly making false statements, and Paul made no attempt to deny or explain those statements. That's damning to most voters.

    Brick,

    To whom have I sold out?

    I'm analyzing what really happened based on how people really vote.  I'm not saying who *should* win or lose the nomination.

    People who are passionate about a candidate tend to view the world as if * everyone* is equally passionate.  Doing so creates a filter bubble that insulates the passionate from the larger community.  Then those insulated few feel victimized when the larger community ignores them.

    Most voters, Brick, are not like you.  Nor or they like me.  For our views to prevail, we have two choices:

    a) we can persuade a majority to agree with us, or
    b) we can use force, violence, or coercion.

    If you think I've sold out to the Establishment, you don't pay much attention to St. Louis politics.

    Troubleshooter,

    Are you saying that you believe Ron Paul increased his chances of winning the GOP nomination last night?  Are you saying you wish most Republican primary voters and caucus-goers agreed with you.

    Attacking people who give honest assessments of the world is no way to influence people and win elections.

    Once again, this post is not an endorsement; it's an observation from a lifelong conservative who communicates with a lot of lifelong conservatives.  I know how these people vote and what turns them on.

    Maybe you have a selective memory? I've been to&nbsp;ALL the Tea Parties and several
    "gatherings" and spoken to most all of you guys. I was part naive and part new
    in the beginning. But it didn't take long to figure out the direction the&nbsp;St.
    Louis Tea Party was going and is still going... and it sure aint "south!" &nbsp;

    Let me repeat my final paragraph:&nbsp;

    "Romney improved his chances, but he didn&rsquo;t close the deal.&nbsp; The longer he lets Santorum and Gingrich stay in the game, the more vulnerable his lead becomes."

    With the largest swath of voters in GOP primaries (not JUST New Hampshire and SC), yes, I think Santorum did best. &nbsp;

    I'm not talking about whose answers I liked the most. &nbsp;I'm talking about the language and demeanor that tends to appeal to a broad group of likely GOP voters. &nbsp;There's a difference.&nbsp;

  content: Toubleshooter, why so hostile? The Post is just an opinion from Bill as
    to who he thought won the debate and asking for other's&nbsp;opinions. For the
    most part I do not put to much credence on debates, because the pundits said George
    W. Bush lost his debates, but still ended up being President. &nbsp;I prefer to
    find out through credible sources the positions of the&nbsp;different&nbsp;candidates.
    I have problems with all of the candidates, but reluctantly am leaning towards
    Perry. As to the prior election, I supported Chuck Pergason, until he lost the
    primary and then voted for Blunt, because he was better than Robin Carnahan and
    hoped he would vote the right way when in office. Unfortunately, Blunt has been
    on the wrong side of many issues. I do not recall the St. Louis Tea Party endorse
    Roy Blunt, though. The STLTP only endorsed Ed Martin. This country elected some
    Conservatives in the 2010 election and we need to continue to do so. This country
    needs to fire the Statists, whether they be liberal&nbsp;Democrats or RINO Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    As a pro capitalist/anti "social" conservative (i.e., Republican socialist/collectivist/neocrat), I'd like to sell my vote to the highest bidder. it's the best outcome for this campaign I can imagine so far. Sure, it's illegal but congress does it all the time.
    I hope for some candidates at the state level with a firm commitment to the tenth amendment &ndash; unlike Santorum who apparently hasn't read it, and the other GOinterloPers who understand it just well enough to know how to get around it. States rights need a big comeback.

    Hmm &nbsp;. . . Maybe Romney's closing the deal.&nbsp;
    http://www.gallup.com/poll/151961/Majority-Conservatives-Romney-Acceptable.aspx&nbsp; I did say that Romney improved his chances of winning the nomination more than any other candidate in Saturday's debate. &nbsp;

    I also think that attacks on Romney's decisions as head of Bain are ridiculous. &nbsp;Conservatives may flock to Mitt in defense of corporate profits--which provide the surplus wealth that pays for things like medicine and sports.&nbsp;

  content: Give me a break!&nbsp; If you use the criteria as indicated above, the
    clear winner in all three categories is Ron Paul.&nbsp; While almost all TV and
    TV on-line news sources would say (and have said) Ron Paul is not able to beat
    Obama...that my friend is pure garbage.&nbsp; Obama has completely lost his ability
    to win in 2012...period.&nbsp; Not one person in over 20,000 individuals across
    this country (most who voted for Obama in 2008) whom I have spoken with will never
    vote for Obama in 2012!&nbsp; Any Republican which ends-up winning the opportunity
    to run aginst Obama will clearly win (outside of voter fraud).&nbsp; Therefore
    Ron Paul will have no problem taking the Presidency in 2012.&nbsp; I feel sorry
    for those who still believe the lies by pollsters like this one here.&nbsp; Thank
    you for allowing my observation and clearly the TRUTH of the matter.&nbsp; It
    will be the most interesting year we have had in over 100+ years in this nation.

  content: 'Honest my ass! I''m not going to repeat myself Bill! Your pathetic assessment
    and the comments thus far on this speak for themselves. You''re a fake! I know
    it and you know it and that''s why I stopped associating with all of you over
    nearly two years ago when you brought RINO Blunt out on stage and endorsed him
    left and right for the entire year leading up to the primaries and the only time
    any of you would even mention Pergusons name was to marginalize and disqualify
    him EXACTLY like you do Ron Paul. You''re part of the indoctrinating machine and
    you know damn good and well you are. Will you admit it? Hell no! Ha! '

    Maybe you have a selective memory? I've been to&nbsp;ALL the Tea Parties and several
    "gatherings" and spoken to most all of you guys. I was part naive and part new
    in the beginning. But it didn't take long to figure out the direction the&nbsp;St.
    Louis Tea Party was going and is still going... and it sure aint "south!" &nbsp;

    Let me repeat my final paragraph:&nbsp;

    "Romney improved his chances, but he didn&rsquo;t close the deal.&nbsp; The longer he lets Santorum and Gingrich stay in the game, the more vulnerable his lead becomes."

    With the largest swath of voters in GOP primaries (not JUST New Hampshire and SC), yes, I think Santorum did best. &nbsp;

    I'm not talking about whose answers I liked the most. &nbsp;I'm talking about the language and demeanor that tends to appeal to a broad group of likely GOP voters. &nbsp;There's a difference.&nbsp;

  content: Toubleshooter, why so hostile? The Post is just an opinion from Bill as
    to who he thought won the debate and asking for other's&nbsp;opinions. For the
    most part I do not put to much credence on debates, because the pundits said George
    W. Bush lost his debates, but still ended up being President. &nbsp;I prefer to
    find out through credible sources the positions of the&nbsp;different&nbsp;candidates.
    I have problems with all of the candidates, but reluctantly am leaning towards
    Perry. As to the prior election, I supported Chuck Pergason, until he lost the
    primary and then voted for Blunt, because he was better than Robin Carnahan and
    hoped he would vote the right way when in office. Unfortunately, Blunt has been
    on the wrong side of many issues. I do not recall the St. Louis Tea Party endorse
    Roy Blunt, though. The STLTP only endorsed Ed Martin. This country elected some
    Conservatives in the 2010 election and we need to continue to do so. This country
    needs to fire the Statists, whether they be liberal&nbsp;Democrats or RINO Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    As a pro capitalist/anti "social" conservative (i.e., Republican socialist/collectivist/neocrat), I'd like to sell my vote to the highest bidder. it's the best outcome for this campaign I can imagine so far. Sure, it's illegal but congress does it all the time.
    I hope for some candidates at the state level with a firm commitment to the tenth amendment &ndash; unlike Santorum who apparently hasn't read it, and the other GOinterloPers who understand it just well enough to know how to get around it. States rights need a big comeback.

    Hmm &nbsp;. . . Maybe Romney's closing the deal.&nbsp;
    http://www.gallup.com/poll/151961/Majority-Conservatives-Romney-Acceptable.aspx&nbsp; I did say that Romney improved his chances of winning the nomination more than any other candidate in Saturday's debate. &nbsp;

    I also think that attacks on Romney's decisions as head of Bain are ridiculous. &nbsp;Conservatives may flock to Mitt in defense of corporate profits--which provide the surplus wealth that pays for things like medicine and sports.&nbsp;

<p>It depends on how you score. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Rick-Santorum.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;" title="Rick-Santorum" border="0" alt="Rick-Santorum" align="right" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Rick-Santorum_thumb.jpg" width="230" height="240"></a></p>
<p>I see three scoring scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Best conservative performance</li>
<li>Best electability performance</li>
<li>Best positional performance</li>
</ol>
<p>Conservative performance is pretty clear: whose answers appeal to conservatives?&nbsp; (Does not mean conservatives <em>believed</em> the candidate meant what he said.) This is not Tea Party scoring, either. I&rsquo;m not limiting my evaluation to the 3 core Tea Party principles of Constitutionally limited government, free markets, and fiscal responsibility.&nbsp; This is broader conservatism. </p>
<p>Electability performance means the candidate appealed to general election voters. This doesn&rsquo;t meant centrist&mdash;it means not scaring the crap out of people who aren&rsquo;t politics wonks. (That&rsquo;s most voters, by the way.)</p>
<p>Positional performance means the candidate did what what he had to do based one his current standings in he nomination process. </p>
<p>On conservative performance, I have to go with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Santorum</li>
<li>Perry</li>
<li>Gingrich / Romney</li>
</ol>
<p>Electability</p>
<ol>
<li>Santorum</li>
<li>Gingrich</li>
<li>Romney</li>
</ol>
<p>Positional</p>
<ol>
<li>Romney</li>
<li>Santorum</li>
<li>Gingrich</li>
</ol>
<p>If we give 3 points for first place, 2 for second, and 1 for third, we get this composite ranking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Santorum: 8 points</li>
<li>Gingrich:&nbsp; 6 points</li>
<li>Romney:&nbsp; 5 points</li>
</ol>
<p>What does it all mean?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Santorum should move up a bit in the polls before the New Hampshire primary, but not enough to win.&nbsp; He needed Romney to finish out of the top 3 in this debate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Gingrich needed to pull Romney out of the top 3 <em>and</em> get closer to Santorum than he did.&nbsp; This hurt Newt.</p>
<p>Romney improved his chances, but he didn&rsquo;t close the deal.&nbsp; The longer he lets Santorum and Gingrich stay in the game, the more vulnerable his lead becomes. </p>
