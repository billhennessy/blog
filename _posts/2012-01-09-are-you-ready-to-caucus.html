<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a caucus and a primary?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s allowed to attend a caucus?</p>
<p>How do I find out my caucus location?</p>
<p>When it the caucus?</p>
<p>How long does it take?</p>
<p>How to do I get ready?</p>
<p><strong>This Is Important Stuff</strong></p>
<p>These are just some of the questions I have about the Missouri Republican Presidential Caucus scheduled for March 17. And I&rsquo;m not the only with questions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why St. Louis Tea Party Coalition has asked caucus expert Ruth Carlson to <em>begin</em> preparing us for this journey.</p>
<p>On Thursday, January 19, Ruth will give us the fundamental, most important, basic information about the caucus process.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Skip the Primary</strong></p>
<p>Plan to vote The Missouri Presidential Primary on February 7, 2012. Plan to vote. Know why?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Because Ruth told me it&rsquo;s important.&nbsp; Apparently, party insiders sometimes try to challenge caucus-goers they don&rsquo;t know. Voting in the Republican primary will insulate you from these charges. Even though the law only requires that you be a registered voter in the district, the insiders sometimes try to put up barriers. </p>
<p><strong>And that&rsquo;s just one of the important lessons Ruth will teach.</strong></p>
<p>So, mark your calendar right now.&nbsp; Plan to be at <a href="http://dev.stlouisteaparty.com/category/the-after-party/" target="_blank">The After Party</a> on Thursday, January 19 at 7:00 pm. Location is:</p>
<p>Fallon&rsquo;s Irish Bar and Grill<br>9200 Olive Blvd., <br>Olivette, MO 63132</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MjBzNzU5ZmdidW5yOW1ybmhzZXA3ZHZjZHMgc2d0Mmw3YjRmYnR1cWtlc29ndHUxdmEyYjhAZw&amp;ctz=America/Chicago" target="_blank">set a reminder here</a>. </p>
