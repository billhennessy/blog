    It's not so much about what I think, it's 150% What do we do about it and when do we start?!
    What is Congress doing? Why is he getting away with it?

    do. &nbsp;The people I'm mad at is the Republican Senators who don't have the
    manhood to file a lawsuit, loudly and publicly. &nbsp;I saw the head of the ACLJ,

    the last I've heard. &nbsp;Even he has to have a client who's been harmed, and
    that most likely means a Senator. &nbsp;Where are our gutless wonders?

<p>Most Americans know more about forensic evidence in the Casey Anthony case than they do about the Constitution.&nbsp; That ignorance gave Barack Obama the hubris to end constitutional government in the United States. He did it, and you probably didn&rsquo;t even notice.</p>
<p><a href="http://brian-therightperspective.blogspot.com/2012/01/levin-president-trashing-constitution.html"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;padding-top:0;border:0;margin:0 8px 0 0;" title="Obama_Dictator" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Obama_Dictator.jpg" alt="Obama_Dictator" width="212" height="244" align="left" border="0" /></a>Over the course of a week, Barack Obama made a series of so-called recess appointments. In the process, he and his henchmen in Eric Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department effectively <strong>nullified the US Constitution</strong>.</p>
<p>The Constitution separates the federal government into three co-equal branches: executive (president), legislative (Congress), and judicial (courts).</p>
<p>Article I of the Constitution gives each House of Congress <a href="http://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/page.aspx?pid=462" target="_blank">the power to make the rules</a> under which it operates.</p>
<blockquote><p>Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the the rules each House sets for itself involves recess.&nbsp; The Senate has rules governing its recesses; the House of Representatives governs its own.</p>
<p>But Obama Administration, through&nbsp; the Justice Department, overruled the Senate&rsquo;s rules on recesses.</p>
<p>Even the liberal <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/us/politics/experts-say-obamas-recess-appointments-could-signify-end-to-a-senate-role.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">New York Times found this dictatorial move troubling</a>, recognizing that the White House has overturned a Senate rule:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Obama went where Mr. Bush had declined to go. He invoked his constitutional right to recess appointments to install four nominees &mdash; the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, and three members of the National Labor Relations Board &mdash; effectively calling the pro forma Senate session illegitimate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its experts agree that Obama has nullified the Constitutional power of the Senate to advise on and consent to certain presidential appointments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans, lawyers and parliamentary experts say the move, if it survives potential legal challenges, could herald an end to the Senate&rsquo;s constitutionally guaranteed right to advice and consent.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for the left to shout &ldquo;hyperbole&rdquo; when confronted with terrifying evidence of Obama&rsquo;s aims. This naked power grab exposes the sorry state of Constitutional government in the United States.&nbsp; It demands drastic action by the courts and Congress and the people.</p>
<p>I see no reason why Congress, business, government employees, and citizens would obey any ruling, regulation, or requirement issued from the illegitimate offices filled without the Senate&rsquo;s advice and consent. No one is required to obey an illegally appointed official, just as no one is required to obey an illegal order in the military. (In fact, a member of the military is required to <em>disobey</em>illegal orders.)</p>
<p>The most significant of these appointments is the frighteningly powerful office Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&mdash;an office with the power to fine private businesses up to $1 million <em>per day</em>.</p>
<p>I also call on all Missouri and Illinois candidates to the US House or Senate to publicly state their position on these anti-Constitutional appointments.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="http://cnsnews.com/blog/patrick-burke/mark-levin-we-have-constitutional-crisis" target="_blank">Constitutional scholar Mark Levin</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The President of the United States is trashing the Constitution now day in and day out.</p></blockquote>
