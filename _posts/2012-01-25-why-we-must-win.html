<p>Think about what&rsquo;s at stake:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court is one liberal away from imposing a radical, unwritten constitution on the United States
<li>The President has shredded the Constitution by seizing the power to declare when the Senate is or is not in session
<li>The United States has fallen many notches in world prestige
<li>We can no longer fight wars on two fronts
<li>The White House and Democrats in the Senate block every attempt at increasing domestic energy production
<li>Our debt is approaching Greece&rsquo;s catastrophic levels
<li>The economy, after nearly four years, is flat on its back
<li>America is losing ground on every front
<li>And Obama made it worse</li>
</ul>
<p>Only you can prevent the collapse of the United States. </p>
<p><strong>And I&rsquo;m proud that St. Louis Tea Party Coalition is there to help us get started.</strong></p>
<p>In commemoration of the third anniversary of the Tea Party movement, St. Louis is joining dozens of Tea Party organizations around the country in kicking off a year of getting out the vote and getting better people in office.</p>
<p>In St. Louis, February 24 and 25 kick off our year of winning.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, February 24</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.patriotshistoryusa.com/">Dr. Larry Schweikart</a> will discuss 7 Events That Made America America.&nbsp; Dr. Schweikart is the New York Times Bestselling author of Glenn Beck&rsquo;s favorite history book, <em>A Patriot&rsquo;s History of the United States</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a documentarian who documented rock and roll&rsquo;s role in <a href="http://www.rockinthewall.com/">bringing down the Berlin Wall</a> and breaking up the Evil Empire.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For the price of a good book, you&rsquo;ll get to meet Dr. Schweikart, hear his fabulous and entertaining message, and enjoy a free drink (plus cash bar) and heavy hors d&rsquo;oeuvres.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll hang around and party as late as you want to go after Dr. Schweikart.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, February 25</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all learning and training.&nbsp; <strong>By 5:00 Saturday night, you&rsquo;ll be armed, eager, and enabled to carry out the fight for the United States&rsquo; future.</strong>&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be an elite warrior for liberty. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have speakers discussing social media campaigning, canvassing, the psychology of voting (you&rsquo;d be surprised how powerful one person can be), how dominate in the upcoming Missouri Presidential Caucus, and more. </p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s events include breakfast and lunch. We&rsquo;re asking for a $50 donation for Saturday to help pay for some of the training, transportation for out-of-town speakers, and meals. Bill Federer, one of St. Louis&rsquo;s finest conservative speakers and political experts, will entertain and inform at lunch.&nbsp; And Dr. Schweikart will be available, too. If you don&rsquo;t know Bill, <a href="http://www.americanminute.com/">check out his American Minute</a> radio show.</p>
<p>And, if she&rsquo;s willing, we&rsquo;ve invited Debbie Wasserman-Schultz to debate the US Constitution on Saturday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d personally love to see what Bill Federer and Dr. Schweikart would make of her . .&nbsp; . &ldquo;intellect.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Your best bet is to get the whole weekend&mdash;Friday and Saturday&mdash;for $65.&nbsp; </strong></p>

7 Events That Made America America with Dr. Larry Schweikart in Clayton, MO  on Eventbrite" src="https://www.eventbrite.com/registerbutton?eid=2760945061"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The location is the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton&mdash;where we kicked off <a href="http://dev.stlouisteaparty.com/category/the-after-party/" target="_blank">The After Party</a> on September 15. </p>
<p><strong>This Is Why We Started This Thing</strong></p>
<p>When we first gathered at the Arch on February 27, 2009, we didn&rsquo;t know where it go. We faithfully followed the path that emerged before us.&nbsp; We took on healthcare, we took on cap and trade, we took on the SEIU and universities and media.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We made some mistakes, and we shined like the sun at times. </p>
<p>In 2010, we made a difference.&nbsp; Not enough of a difference, but a difference. </p>
<p><strong>Now we&rsquo;ve reached the crossroads of our civilization's existence.</strong>&nbsp; Down one path lies the hard work for restoring sound government, fiscal responsibility, and free markets.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Down the other path lies the harder work of living in a jungle of tyrannical lords amidst a broader social chaos.</p>
<p>Either way, there&rsquo;s hard work to be done.&nbsp; If you join the 300 on February 24 and 25, you&rsquo;ll choose the hard work of restoring a better society.&nbsp; The other choice will seem easier . . . until the barbarians knock.</p>
<p>Space is limited.&nbsp; Get your tickets early.</p>
