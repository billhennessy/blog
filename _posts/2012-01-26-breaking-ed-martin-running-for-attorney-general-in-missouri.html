<p>Ed Martin Jr. of St. Louis has redirected his fire to the Attorney General race, and this is great news for everyone except Chris Koster.</p>
<p>Back when <a href="http://edmartinforcongress.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a> was talking about running for the Republican nod to take on Claire McCaskill, I had another thought.&nbsp; Well, a bunch of people had another thought: <em>Ed would make an outstanding Attorney General</em>.</p>
<p>*********UPDATE*********</p>
<p>HUGE list of endorsements on <a href="http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=3096f9f3497e58f2da967c33d&amp;id=0f71753ec3&amp;e=bbb3498998" target="_blank">Ed&rsquo;s official press release</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>******************************</p>
<p>I guess I was right. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ed-martin-kickoff.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="Ed Martin for Congress" border="0" alt="Ed Martin for Congress" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ed-martin-kickoff_thumb.jpg" width="423" height="360"></a></p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed that Ed chose to run for Todd Akin&rsquo;s US House seat. <strong>Ed would make a great conservative legislator.&nbsp; And as I said before, so will </strong><a href="http://annwagner.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ann Wagner</strong></a><strong>,</strong> who can now focus on&nbsp; . . . whichever Democrat decides to give a concession speech at 7:01 pm on November 6. </p>
<p>But, at this pivotal moment in history, <strong>as Attorney General, Ed Martin will be Missouri&rsquo;s general in the war on Washington abuse</strong>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>First, <strong>Ed has used his law license for the good of society</strong>, to protect life, to defend the wrongly accused, and to advance his&mdash;our&mdash;conservative principles.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not a lawyer who&rsquo;s in it for the money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve met some of the people he&rsquo;s helped, and I&rsquo;ve heard their stories. </p>
<p>In these battles, including a nationally covered battle against Illinois&rsquo;s criminal Governor Rod Blagojevich, <strong>Ed Martin was tenacious, principled, and victorious.</strong></p>
<p>Missouri needs an AG who will fight for the right things.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Second, <strong>Ed understands that the battle for liberty over the next 12 years will be fought between the states and Washington. </strong>The states&mdash;and only the states&mdash;have the Constitutional power and the economic leverage fight Washington and win.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Several States vs. US Government will be ugly,long, and painful. [Insert your analogy here.]&nbsp; Most people will lose their stomach before it&rsquo;s over. People&mdash;even good conservatives&mdash;will want to throw in the towel and heel to the Washington monster.</p>
<p>Ed won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; <strong>He understands that Congress, with its entrenched establishment and elitist snobbery, is as close to a lost cause as you&rsquo;ll find</strong>.&nbsp; He wants to be one of 50 state attorneys general who, with their governors and secretaries of state, beat Congress into submission.(I said &ldquo;ugly.&rdquo;)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ed Martin has a clear path to take on turncoat Democrat Koster in November.&nbsp; That fight begins today. <strong>When Ed prevails in November, Missouri will have an Attorney General who actually has read and understands the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution&mdash;and a man who&rsquo;s smart to know it matters.</strong></p>
