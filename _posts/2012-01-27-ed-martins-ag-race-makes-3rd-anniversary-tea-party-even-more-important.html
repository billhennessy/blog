<p>Two weeks ago, weeks ago, how many Missouri statewide offices did you expect to flip? &nbsp;Be honest.</p>
<p>Yes, there are great people running for Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer.&nbsp; And we already have a fine Lieutenant Governor Kinder running for re-election.</p>
<p>But numerous factors, like name recognition, experience, and Jay Nixon&rsquo;s weird relationship with Republican House leadership, made a major upset unlikely. And no Republicans had stepped up to challenge Chris Koster for Attorney General.</p>
<p><strong>Until </strong><a href="http://edmartinformissouri.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a><strong></strong><strong> jumped into AG race yesterday. </strong></p>
<p>Now, we have a fight.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/moseal.gif"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="moseal" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/moseal_thumb.gif" alt="Great Seal of the State of Missouri" width="295" height="300" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Ed&rsquo;s statewide name recognition, familiarity with Jefferson City, and enormous respect among grass roots put every statewide office immediately in play.</p>
<p>But every race will be a dogfight.&nbsp; Every race will be bruising.&nbsp; Every candidate will need every possible vote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m thrilled, giddy, jubilant, proud, and <em>pantingly pleased</em> that the <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com" target="_blank">St. Louis Tea Party Coalition</a> has joined the nationwide <a href="http://www.electiondayteaparty.com" target="_blank">Election Day Tea Party</a>.</p>
<p>And<strong> I&rsquo;m more thrilled, giddy, etc. that we&rsquo;re kicking off election season with the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party PLUS 7 Events That Made America America with Dr. Larry Schweikart.&nbsp; </strong></p>

7 Events That Made America America with Dr. Larry Schweikart in Clayton, MO  on Eventbrite" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Friday is Dr. Schweikart, author of <em>A Patriot&rsquo;s History of the United States</em>.&nbsp; Larry puts on one hell of a show.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll provde hors d&rsquo;oeuvres, a free drink, a cash bar, and an After Party.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday is a full day of getting down and dirty with winning some friggin&rsquo; elections</strong>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have training from local and national experts, inspirational talks from Bill Federer and Dr. Schweikart, caucus training, social media training for beginners and experts, and more. We&rsquo;ve taken care of breakfast AND lunch, so you can focus on the fight.</p>
<p><strong>With four statewide offices now totally in play, we all need to arm our minds with the most important facts to win in 2012.&nbsp; But wait; there&rsquo;s more!</strong></p>
<p>In St. Louis&rsquo;s reconstituted 1st US Congressional District, <strong><a href="http://martinbakerforcongress.com/" target="_blank">the indefatigable Martin Baker</a></strong> has a chance to flip a seat that&rsquo;s been Democrat since the destruction of federalism was only gleam in FDR&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p><strong>Plus, we have a Saul Alinsky socialist to evict from the White House!</strong></p>
<p>Please get your tickets now. Tickets for Friday&rsquo;s event are going very fast, and Saturday&rsquo;s moving, too.&nbsp; Once they&rsquo;re gone, they&rsquo;re gone&mdash;we don&rsquo;t have room for more.</p>
<p>Remember, Friday and Saturday, February 24 and 25 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton, MO.&nbsp; Get your tickets here, today.</p>
