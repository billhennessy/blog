<p>At some point, each additional GOP Presidential debate becomes just a bigger pain in the . . . But science shows us that the last debate before a vote&mdash;and the last memorable event in the last debate&mdash;is paramount to how we remember the entire event.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In fact, <strong>memorable moments at the end, not consistent performance throughout, determine who wins and who loses</strong>. </p>
<p>In this awesome TED talk, Nobel winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains the weird difference between our experiencing selves and our remembering selves.&nbsp; And his research offers very important information for candidates and campaigns:</p>
<p><a href="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf">http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf</a></p>
<p><strong>If you want to win, forget the experience; own the memory.</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you can predict primary results from the last debate when the candidates are close and a lot of voters are only mildly committed.&nbsp; (There&rsquo;s a lot of great information about how committed minds defend their decisions, but that&rsquo;s for a later post.)</p>
<p>Whether writing a blog post, planning an event, giving a speech, or just engaging in a conversation, <strong>the audience&rsquo;s memory will not be the sum of the experience, but the memory created</strong>.&nbsp; As Kahneman points out, memories of colonoscopies are better when the unpleasant experience lasts longer.</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich won South Carolina&rsquo;s final debate and its primary. Then, Newt under performed in Florida&rsquo;s final debate . . . and now he&rsquo;s losing ground to Romney. Just like a protracted colonoscopy.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>:&nbsp; Candidates and parties worry about the spin as much as they worry about the presentation for this exact reason. The media itself determines who wins a debate, too, by dominating memory.&nbsp; <strong>Most people don&rsquo;t watch debates or major speeches. </strong><a href="http://hennessysview.com/political-science/2012-election-political-science/who-won-the-new-hampshire-republican-debate/" target="_blank"><strong>They get a summary</strong></a><strong> from the news.</strong>&nbsp; And that summary is designed to influence their memories.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>P.S.&nbsp; I will be talking about the brain science of winning elections on Saturday, February 25, at the <a href="http://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">3rd Anniversary Tea Party.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t miss it.</a></strong></p>
