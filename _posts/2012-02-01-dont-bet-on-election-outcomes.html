<p>&ldquo;Anybody will beat Obama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I get some comments and see a lot of tweets about the inevitability that any Republican will win in November.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s frightening.</p>
<p>The prospect of a Republican beating Obama isn't frightening, of course&mdash;any of the four remaining candidates would be night and day better for our future.&nbsp; <strong>What&rsquo;s frightening is that so many people bet on the unknowable</strong>.</p>
<p>Except in rare cases&mdash;one candidate is caught stealing from a church weeks before the election&mdash;political elections carry too many variables for anyone to predict their results a month in advance, much less three-quarters of a year ahead.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/capricious.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12551" title="capricious" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/capricious.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>News agencies and pollsters make their prognostications with an enormous caveat: &ldquo;if the election were held today.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ve learned that a lot can happen between today and November.</p>
<p>The pundits seem to not know this. Or they prefer to ignore the reality of randomness, hoping their guess is correct, in which case, they&rsquo;ll look like geniuses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the <a href="http://wp.me/p653B-31j" target="_blank">influence of memories on elections</a>, and on the <a href="http://bit.ly/wyOq52" target="_blank">role of emotions</a>.&nbsp; But <strong>we can&rsquo;t ignore the problem of, what Donald Rumsfeld called, &ldquo;the unknown unknowns.&rdquo;</strong> And these unknowns are why you shouldn&rsquo;t bet on elections.</p>
<p><strong>Herman Cain had a lot of unknown unknowns, didn&rsquo;t he? </strong> Before the train of women problems emerged, I might have been tempted to say &ldquo;Herman&rsquo;s gonna do it.&rdquo; My mind may have even thought that Herman was going to win.&nbsp; Had I predicted Cain the winner <em>and</em> Cain had won, would I have been right?</p>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &ldquo;right.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the one hand, the truth condition (Cain won) would match my prediction (Cain will win).&nbsp; On the other hand, no matter how smart I might think I am, I could not have <em>known</em> Cain would win.&nbsp; My chances of being right were no better than chance. Or, as Daniel Kahneman might say, my chances of being right are about he same as chimpanzee throwing darts.</p>
<p>If I believe my own predictions, if I build great defenses of my predictions, I might be quite convincing. Still,<strong> I&rsquo;d be falling for what Nassim Taleb calls the <em>narrative fallacy</em>. </strong></p>
<p>Again, from Daniel Kahneman:</p>
<blockquote><p>Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen. Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative. Taleb suggests that we humans constantly fool ourselves by constructing flimsy accounts of the past and believing they are true.</p>
<p>Kahneman, Daniel (2011-10-25). Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 199). Macmillan. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>The past in politics often includes opinion polls, past elections, and conversations with the butcher.&nbsp; (If there still are conversations with butchers.)</p>
<p>When you hear someone say, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter who wins the nomination, because most people will vote for anyone who isn&rsquo;t Obama,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t fall for it.&nbsp; Remind them that <strong>millions of Democrats believed the same about George W. Bush in 2004.</strong></p>
<p>Who wins the Republican nomination matters, or will matter, in November.&nbsp; But regardless of the nominee, the final outcome of the race is anybody&rsquo;s guess.</p>
