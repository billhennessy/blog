<p>There are some things you just don&rsquo;t say in a cover letter&mdash;or on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>A self-aggrandizing cover letter from an NYU undergrad to some Wall Street banks has the whole financial world laughing. The kid&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve hubris and ignorance of what employers look for in a candidate earned him public humiliation on an internet scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s just a sample of the kid&rsquo;s self-promotion:</p>
<blockquote><p>That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups</p>
<p><em>(Read more: </em><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-tenacious-summer-analyst-applicant-got-laughed-at-by-goldman-morgan-and-everyone-else-on-wall-street-2012-2#ixzz1loTZYiIe"><em>http://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-tenacious-summer-analyst-applicant-got-laughed-at-by-goldman-morgan-and-everyone-else-on-wall-street-2012-2#ixzz1loTZYiIe</em></a><em>)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Mitt Romney should be even more embarrassed. He&rsquo;s a lot older and, theoretically, wiser, you know.</p>

<p><strong>After Rick Santorum destroyed the establishment&rsquo;s plastic candidate of choice, Romney&rsquo;s spokesman gave a remarkably idiotic reason to support Romney: </strong><a href="http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/article/santorum-surged-romney-and-gingrich-fought/364226" target="_blank"><strong>Money and infrastructure</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The reason <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012-election/new-hampshire-exposes-gops-diverse-base/" target="_blank">Romney won&rsquo;t beat Obama</a> and shouldn&rsquo;t win the GOP nomination is his hubris and his inability to think like a human being. Romney is the reason that Republican voter turnout is abysmal and why <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/02/republican-enthusiasm-issue-is-real.html" target="_blank">Democrats are now more enthusiastic about voting than Republicans are</a>.</p>
<p>The republic&rsquo;s greatest threat since the British army of 1812 now sits in the White House.&nbsp; In 2009 and 2010, the Tea Party resuscitated a comatose GOP and won back the House.&nbsp; Since then, <strong>the inept, elitist, and self-serving Republican establishment has reasserted its thumb-laden hands, chosen an elitist candidate, and killed enthusiasm among those who actually get out the vote and win elections</strong>&mdash;the conservative grass roots.</p>
<p>If Romney and his elitist Republican friends manage to give Obama four more years to destroy this country, the GOP, not Obama, will face the angry mobs of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/tea-party/unknowing-believers/" target="_blank">America&rsquo;s 60% conservative base</a>.</p>
