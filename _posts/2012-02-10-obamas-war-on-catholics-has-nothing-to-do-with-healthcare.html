    <strong>Wars: Then &amp; Now...</strong>

    Wars are much different this day than they were in years past, but some things remain the same.On Monday, 8 December 1941, the cows got milked, the eggs got collected, steel was milled, and vehicles rolled off the assembly lines. The ships still smoked...

    To be fair to the incompetent won, the Catholic Church brought this upon itself. According to exit polls about 54% of its membership who voted in November 2008 voted for one of the few politicians to achieve a 100% rating from baby-killer outfits such as NARAL. Many prominent members of the &Oslash;&rsquo;bumorrhoid regime such as a former female speaker of the bordello, the health and human disservices secretary, a 2004 candidate for president and the veep, are also well-respected in Catholic Church circles. Their poison more scandalizes the Church than a small Polish Parish just wanting to run its own business, yet the Church all too happily fetes them and takes their gifts. Catholic Universities were willing to hide their religious symbols in order to satisfy the golden calf's demand that only he be worshiped when giving a teleprompter recital to impressionable skulls full of mush on their campuses and accepted their honorifics. Many of the very bishops so upset today supported this kommie loon back in 2008 and were all for &Oslash;&rsquo;bumorrkare back in the day. Did they not know he was a subtil serpent when they clasped him to their bosom, a ravening wolf in a lawyer's wool suit? I knew it, so it wasn't all that hard to figure out. Before they go all Richard the Lionhearted on us, they need to get themselves right with God else they will only achieve the same result as did the Children's Crusade.

    &ldquo;Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.&rdquo;
    Genesis 3:1 King James Version
    &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.&rdquo;
    Matthew 7:15 (KJV)
    &ldquo;And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.&rdquo;
    Matthew 7:3-5 (KJV)
    &ldquo;And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.&rdquo;
    1 Samuel 8:7&nbsp; (KJV)
    &ldquo;And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.&rdquo;
    1 Samuel 8:18&nbsp; (KJV)

    I agree that many Catholics, especially in the US and parts of Latin America, put secular humanism ahead of the church's actual teaching. &nbsp;And many Catholics, even priests and bishops, teach their own theology instead of the Church's theology. &nbsp;(Just because a Catholic says it, doesn't make it Catholic.)&nbsp;

    That said, the Church is not a democracy, representative or otherwise. That 54% of Catholics voted for Obama indicates that 54% of self-identified Catholics are either poorly formed or choose to ignore the church's teaching. Bishops can't push the touchscreen for us, and some of them would hit the wrong button, anyway.&nbsp;

    It is ironic, though, that two identifiable religious minorities in America--Catholics and Jews--voted for a President who despises them and their faith.&nbsp;

<p>Obama&rsquo;s dictate that Catholic organizations must participate in contraception and abortion has nothing to do with healthcare or rights or contraception or anything of the sort. Not at all. Modern dictatorships don&rsquo;t operate that way.</p>
<p><strong>Obama just destroyed the free practice clause of the First Amendment, and that&rsquo;s exactly what he intended. </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obama declared <em>jihad</em> on Christianity.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/crusaders.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:0 6px 0 0;" title="crusaders" border="0" alt="crusaders" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/crusaders_thumb.jpg" width="181" height="240"></a>Obama exercised absolute power&mdash;the power he warned us about at the State of the Union address.</p>
<p>Notice his &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; on the matter. Today, Obama ordered insurance companies to provide contraceptives and abortifacients to employees of the Catholic church&nbsp; . . . <em>for free!</em></p>
<p><strong>Obama has told us that he despises the Constitution because it &ldquo;reflected fundamental flaw of this country that continues to this day.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subordinating the Catholic church to his despotic rule is just one step in his perverted mission to fix those flaws.</p>
<p><strong>Time to open up a can of crusade on this potentate.</strong></p>
