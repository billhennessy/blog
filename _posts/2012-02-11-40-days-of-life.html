<p>Forty Days of Life is a peaceful, prayerful response the poverty of abortion. </p>
<p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-AfLO6Oevo]</p>
<p><strong>The Coalition for Life is a community based Christian pro-life organization made up of over 90 churches and thousands of individuals</strong> who are working to end abortion in St. Louis, peacefully and prayerfully.&nbsp; <u></u><u></u>
<p><u></u><u></u>
<p><strong>The 40 Days for Life St. Louis Adopt-A-Day program is for Churches and/or Organizations</strong> that feel God is calling them to a day of prayer at our vigil location near Planned Parenthood on Forest Park Avenue.<u></u><u></u>
<p><u></u><u></u>
<p>Each of us can make a difference.</p>
