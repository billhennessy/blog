  content: Come on Bill.&nbsp; I'm finding it difficult to follow you here.&nbsp;
    What do you really think?&nbsp; Serioiusly, I could not agree more.&nbsp; Romney
    has only "talked the talk" the last couple of months in an effort to win the Conservative
    and Tea Party vote.&nbsp; Prior to that he thought that he could win without us.&nbsp;
    And there's no way that he can win without that Conservative/Tea Party contingent
    enthusiastically fighting for him this fall.&nbsp; That also includes the Ron
    Paul supporters, who must not sit out the vote because their guy does not make
    it.

  content: "Bill I agree with you about Romney. When I talk with people at my workplace,
    no one is happy with any of the offerings we have been given.&nbsp; But, everyone
    seems to agree, the point is to remove these criminals from running our country
    into destruction. And for that reason, we are all in agreement, WHO EVER GETS
    THE NOMINATION GETS OUR VOTE!&nbsp; \n\nThat person can be a one term president
    until we can find a true conservative for the next election. But the point here
    is to take Congress, TOTALLY, remove Harry, and most importantly BO. As long as
    he can get away with overriding the Constitution,&nbsp; his Czars (not approved
    by congress) and his executive orders we are doomed.&nbsp; The things that are
    being done to destroy America are too numerous to even count at this point. The
    ones we hear about are only the diversions to keep us from knowing all the ugly
    details.&nbsp; Lets also not forget, the PRESIDENT PROPOSES, CONGRESS DISPOSES.
    Even if it is Romney, with a conservative congress we can still effect the change
    we want.&nbsp; The religious right, and those who think they are standing on principal,
    may be contributing to our demise. There is a time and place for those views,
    but sadly there is so much at stake right now; this is the moment of our survival
    or destruction.\n\n&nbsp;So, once again, I will hold my nose and vote, for who
    ever the nominee may be."

<p>The liberal press cannot issue a story about the Republican presidential race that does not refer to Mitt Romney&rsquo;s need (and inability) to &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; conservatives. Puke.</p>
<p>Relate to this: <strong>if Mitt Romney&rsquo;s a conservative, I&rsquo;m a Hottentot</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mitt-romney-tsa1.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="mitt-romney-tsa" border="0" alt="mitt-romney-tsa" align="left" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mitt-romney-tsa_thumb1.jpg" width="244" height="184"></a></p>
<p>By &ldquo;relate to,&rdquo; the media and Romney&rsquo;s handlers actually mean&nbsp; &ldquo;hoodwink.&rdquo;&nbsp; While Romney might secure the GOP nomination without conservative support, his campaign will go down in flames without <a href="http://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">conservative grassroots boots on the ground from Labor</a> Day to Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>The only way Romney can win the hearts and minds of conservatives is to relive the past 20 years of his life.&nbsp; This time as a conservative.</strong></p>
<p>Romney might <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2012/02/10/at-cpac-romney-stresses-conservative-credentials/" target="_blank">win more favor among conservatives</a> by simply acknowledging who and what he is: an East Coast, Blue Blood, Rockefeller Republican with severely elitist views of government&rsquo;s role in people&rsquo;s lives. (<a href="http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/11/romney-corporations-are-people" target="_blank">And by &ldquo;people&rdquo; I include corporations</a>.)</p>
