<p>The latest <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/02/santorum-surges-into-the-lead.html" target="_blank">Public Policy Poll shows Santorum</a> surging&mdash;big time.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RickSantorumInVest.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="RickSantorumInVest" border="0" alt="RickSantorumInVest" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RickSantorumInVest_thumb.jpg" width="474" height="349"></a></p>
<p><strong>Santorum is most appealing to conservatives&mdash;from Evangelicals to Tea Partiers: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Santorum is now completely dominating with several key segments of the electorate, especially the most right leaning parts of the party. With those describing themselves as 'very conservative,' he's now winning a majority of voters at 53% to 20% for Gingrich and 15% for Romney.&nbsp; Santorum gets a majority with Tea Party voters as well at 51% to 24% for Gingrich and 12% for Romney. And with Evangelicals he falls just short of a majority with 45% to 21% for Gingrich and 18% for Romney.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for Santorum&rsquo;s lead is likeability. Sixty-four percent of Republicans view Senator Santorum favorably&mdash;far more than any other candidate. </p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney&rsquo;s attack machine, though, is about to aim its distortion guns at the former Senator</strong>. Mitt won&rsquo;t offer a vision, so he&rsquo;s adopted a slash-and-burn strategy in hopes of driving people to despise his opponents. That strategy might win the nomination, but I fail to see how it will win the election.</p>
