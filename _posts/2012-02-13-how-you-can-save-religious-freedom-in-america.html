<p>When Barack Obama declared that Catholics must either violate their consciences or face government persecution, he wasn&rsquo;t going after just Catholics.&nbsp; <a href="http://hennessysview.com/political-science/obamas-war-on-catholics-has-nothing-to-do-with-healthcare/" target="_blank">Nor was he promoting healthcare</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment</strong>.&nbsp; They tried to erase religious freedom.&nbsp; They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.</p>
<p><strong>And they will try again!<a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/bloggish/item/washingtons_letter_on_religious_freedom_not_so_free_20111122/" target="_blank"><img style="display:inline;float:right;margin:0 0 0 8px;" align="right" src="http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/bloggers_auto/religious_freedom2.jpg" width="368" height="245"></a></strong></p>
<p>Unless you stop them. </p>
<p>But how are you going to stop them alone?&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Well, you are not alone.</strong></p>
<p>On <a href="http://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">February 24 and 25</a>, you can meet your army and get your training.&nbsp; You can become a soldier in the war for religious and economic freedom.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <a href="http://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">3rd Anniversary Tea Party</a> weekend is boot camp for the battle of 2012.&nbsp; For just $65 for the entire weekend&mdash;meals included&mdash;you can arm yourself with the latest in political warfare. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t make it both days?&nbsp; Tickets are available for Friday evening or Saturday, too. </p>
<p>But please <a href="http://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">sign up now</a>.&nbsp; We need to know how many soldiers are willing to launch this battle. </p>
<p>If you cannot attend, sponsor someone else to take your place. </p>
<p><strong>Please pray for our mission whether you attend or not.&nbsp; We need God&rsquo;s help above all else.</strong></p>
<p>Obama showed us just how far he&rsquo;s willing to go to <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/church-339789-one-catholic.html" target="_blank">eradicate, or at least subdue, religion from the United States</a>. He&rsquo;s willing to go further. Given another four years and the mandate of re-election, Obama&rsquo;s change will extinguish hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>This is our crusade.&nbsp; This is our battle. This our prayer.&nbsp; That we may remain <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/bloggish/item/washingtons_letter_on_religious_freedom_not_so_free_20111122/" target="_blank">free to worship and live</a>, to work and pray as we think best in pursuit of happiness and a good society</strong>.</p>
