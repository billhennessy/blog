<p>Don&rsquo;t bother blaming it on poll questions designed to lead respondents.&nbsp; Never mind that it&rsquo;s a long way until the election. And stop whining about the White House fudging the numbers on unemployment.</p>
<p>The fact is that Obama&rsquo;s surging at just the right time. His re-election chances are now above 50 percent. His intrade.com chances of winning are near 60 percent. And he&rsquo;s raising more money than al of the Republican candidates combined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Republicans Advertise; Democrats Market</strong>:&nbsp; For decades, conservatives have held marketers in disdain.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve done the same for the fields that support marketing: creative writing, acting, music, art, education, soft sciences, and entertainment.&nbsp; As a result, fewer and fewer casual voters feel emotionally connected to Republicans.</p>
<p>Unless the GOP figures out how to stop shouting and start connecting, they&rsquo;ll take a drubbing in November.</p>
<p><strong>Team Obama Will Do Anything to Win</strong>: Of course they&rsquo;ll cheat and break the law. They pretty much tell us so.&nbsp; That can also work against them. To turn the tide, though, Republicans have to show the cheating, not whine about it.</p>
<p>When Mike Tyson bit off Evander Holyfield's ear, everyone became a Holyfield fan and turned against Tyson. Had Holyfield blamed the bite for every bad thing that happened thereafter, we&rsquo;d have tired of him very quickly. And if we hadn&rsquo;t seen the bite in slow motion, we&rsquo;d never have believed him.</p>
<p>Be patient. Record everything. <em>Show</em>, don&rsquo;t <em>tell</em> people.&nbsp; People will the do the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment Kills Apathy</strong>:&nbsp; (Yes, I&rsquo;m sort of in this boat myself. Sort of.)&nbsp; Casual voters take their cues on whom to support from the passionate politics wonks they know. If you&rsquo;re one of the wonks and you&rsquo;re showing apathy, you&rsquo;re sending a strong signal to the causals.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re saying, in effect, &ldquo;Go ahead and vote for Obama; we&rsquo;ll try again in 2016.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two problems with this approach:&nbsp; first, if your party isn&rsquo;t ready to field a viable candidate for President every four years, your party should probably disband.&nbsp; Second, if we give Obama another 4 years, there might not be an election as we know them in 2016.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still not committed and you&rsquo;re still not enthused, then buy a ticket for the <a href="http://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">3rd Anniversary Tea Party</a> anyway.&nbsp; Maybe someone there will inspire you.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always just give up and blame someone else.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s becoming the new American way.</p>
