    GREAT ANOLOGY! &nbsp;Catholics use individual conscience whether or not to use birth control. My church, my choice! &nbsp;Democrats screaming for years about separation of Church and State, and then dare to interfere with Catholic beliefs.
    We have a Dictator for president, who eliminates babies through Abortion, and now Seniors through ObamaCare calling us Units. &nbsp;Who knows better then what America has at risk then the Seniors who have lived and died for freedom.
    Obama crossed the line! &nbsp;The Catholic Church is finally getting that ObamaCare is not charity, but a way of controlling our freedoms! &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/badcatholic/2012/02/is-contraception-a-right.html" target="_blank">In this post on Obama&rsquo;s continuing jihad against Christianity</a>, he answers a burning question: did human happiness exist before artificial contraception?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Put another way, is chemical birth control a natural state of humanity?</p>
<p>Before you answer, read the post. Think about it.&nbsp; </p>
