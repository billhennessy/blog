  content: Thanks for the information. I had a medical procedure postponed so I can
    come to the "caucus-fest" at least through the morning (yeah, I'm an old white
    guy - like you need more of those). I'm sorry you won't be there but hope to meet
    you and thank you for your efforts at sometime during this election year.

<p>Just because it&rsquo;s after 10:00 am, doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t come to the <a href="http://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">3rd Anniversary Tea Party</a>.</p>
<p>No, we didn&rsquo;t come up with a policy for people who arrive late to the feast. We will find a way to get you involved that&rsquo;s fair to everyone.</p>
<p>Grab your laptop or your mobile device, if you have one, get in your car, and drive to the Crowne Plaza in Clayton.&nbsp; Ask for the Tea Party.</p>
<p>Your country needs you.</p>
