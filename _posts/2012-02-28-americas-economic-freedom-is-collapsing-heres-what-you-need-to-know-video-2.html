<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/liberty-movement/when-did-we-stop-getting-freer-in-america/" target="_blank">I blogged about freedom envy&mdash;the feeling Americans get when they look at countries where the people get freer every day</a>. </p>
<p>Today, thanks to <a href="http://www.economicfreedom.org/2011/10/11/episode-two-economic-freedom-in-america-today/" target="_blank">Economic Freedom blog, we have a great video to introduce the idea&nbsp; of economic freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Does that sound silly?&nbsp; I mean, aren&rsquo;t Americans <em>born</em> with an understanding of economic freedom?&nbsp; And craving to preserve it?</p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p>But our schools, entertainment, press, and, above all, GOVERNMENT beats economic freedom out of us by the time we&rsquo;re 14 years old. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to beat schools, entertainment, the press, and government into submission.&nbsp; (Yes, I really typed that, you lefty pansies!)</p>
<p>You wanna fight back against the tyrants?&nbsp; Then watch this video and follow the directions. </p>

<p>America is about to drop out of the top 10 nations in economic freedom.&nbsp; And <strong><em>we invented the practice of economic freedom, by God!</em></strong></p>
