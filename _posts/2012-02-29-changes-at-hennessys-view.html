<p>Looks different, doesn't it?</p>
<p>After hosting my own web sites forever, I'm trying to simplify my server admin life. I'm moving Hennessy's View to another service from my own servers.</p>
<p>The difference you should see is the theme. &nbsp;(I'm tired of the minimalism.) Also, some archives from before 2010 might be missing for a while. They'll catch up soon enough.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>**UPDATE** In addition to the changes above, a couple of comments posted during the upgrade have been lost. &nbsp;I apologize for that. &nbsp;If your comment is missing, please repeat it. &nbsp;Otherwise, I'll try to recover them tonight.</p>
