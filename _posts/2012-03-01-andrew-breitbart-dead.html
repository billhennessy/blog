<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/report-andrew-breitbart-has-died-2012-3" target="_blank">Business Insider has picked up a Big Journalism story that Andrew Breitbart died last night</a>.&nbsp; (Big Journalism is one of Breitbart&rsquo;s web sites.)</p>
<p>If this is true, then we&rsquo;ve lost a gallant warrior in the battle to preserve and advance freedom and liberty.</p>
<p>Of course, the lefties will flood the internet with hate and bile.&nbsp; So maybe the obit is a plot to draw the lefties out and reveal them for who and what they really are. I hope it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>**UPDATE: 8:58 am Central** <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Ben_Howe/statuses/175221170499629058" target="_blank">Ben Howe tweets that he has independent confirmation</a>.&nbsp; As has <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/01/andrew-breitbart-dead-at-43-according-to-his-website/" target="_blank">Daily Caller, via LA Coroner&rsquo;s office</a></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Last time I was in Andrew&rsquo;s company was last June?&nbsp; He was in St. Louis for Smart Girls Politics convention with his son. Had drinks at Mike Shannon&rsquo;s after the event.&nbsp; Andrew was excited (as he always is) that I might be spending lots of time in LA county. (Or maybe he was just being polite.&nbsp; Either way, his enthusiasm made me feel good.)</p>
<p>I keep thinking &ldquo;irreplaceable.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because Andrew&rsquo;s flaws were as vital as his strengths.&nbsp; The fact that he never took himself seriously enough, that he picked fights that didn&rsquo;t need to be picked, and that he continued fight them after they were already decided.</p>
<p>Were those flaws? Or did Andrew just have tougher guts and stronger instincts than the rest of us?</p>
<p>He designed (in the broader sense of the word) Huffington Post. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/" target="_blank">With that, Breitbart.com, and the Bigs, he transformed the internet and, thereby, politics.</a>&nbsp; He withstood campaigns of lies orchestrated in the Obama White House and executed by CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, New York Times, Washington Post, and Media Matters.</p>
<p>Andrew was something of the figure I&rsquo;d hoped to become growing up: the next William F. Buckley.&nbsp; What I mean by that is he defined movement conservatism for&nbsp; generation.</p>
<p>But his reign was aborted.&nbsp; So soon. So, so too soon.</p>
<p>I pray for his soul, for his family, and for our country.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve lost a general in the war for liberty.&nbsp; Each of us, now must carry a heavier load.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong></p>
<p>Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let the perpetual light shine on him. May he rest in peace. And may God have mercy on us all.</p>
