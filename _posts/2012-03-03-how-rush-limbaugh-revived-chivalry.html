<p>A Georgetown law student turned the Democrat Party from an androgynous blob into a modern day Ivanhoe. (Yes, I&rsquo;ll tread carefully around that &ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo; to spare Democrat sensibilities.)</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ivanhoe.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="Ivanhoe" border="0" alt="Ivanhoe" align="left" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ivanhoe_thumb.jpg" width="171" height="244" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Sandra Fluke, the student, begged Congress to confiscate property from me and millions of other taxpayers in order to satisfy her sexual appetite</strong>. </p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh pointed out that law school lasts three years, condoms cost about a buck each, and Ms. Fluke needed 3,000 of them just to make it to the bar exam. </p>
<p>And she wants the federal government to put a gun to your head to pay for them.</p>
<p>Limbaugh&rsquo;s editorial included the obvious conclusion: Ms. Fluke&rsquo;s libido would wear out the (libeled) Duke Lacrosse team.</p>
<p>Democrats went apoplectic. Their direct mail consultants broke fingernails furiously banging out fundraising letters to millions of morally challenged Democrat donors.&#160; In a noble desire to defend the honor of the Georgetown Slattern, chivalry is reborn. </p>
<p><strong>The Democrat and media hypocrisy smells like a Philadelphia trash barge in August</strong>.&#160; (Yes, I&rsquo;ve been there.)&#160; I could list a thousand instances of lefties libeling innocent people simply for being&mdash;not like them. </p>
<p>One example is the <a href="http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20099354,00.html" target="_blank">Tawana Brawley case, in which Rev. Al Sharpton worked to frame an innocent man</a>. (See <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/132044.stm" target="_blank">Sharpton Loses Libel Case</a>.)</p>
<p>The Duke Lacrosse team is another example. When a black stripper accused members of the team of rape, the leftist media immediately and finally pronounced the white men guilty.&#160; Eugene Robinson, the Washington Post&rsquo;s Race-Baiter-in-Residence, led the charge.&#160; And Duke&rsquo;s leftist professors refused to back down long after charges were dropped. And why did the Duke faculty let the false rape charges against white male students live on?&#160; Because they&rsquo;re cowards or liars.&#160; </p>
<p>In their book <em>Rush to Judgment: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case</em>, Stuart Taylor and KC Johnson, journalists, explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, as some admitted privately to friends, they were also afraid to cross the activists&mdash;black and female activists especially&mdash;lest they be smeared with charges of racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, or right-wingism.</p>
<p>That's what would happen to a chemistry professor who&mdash;months after the team's innocence had become clear&mdash;became the first member of the arts and sciences faculty to break ranks with the academic herd. It took less than twenty-four hours for the head of Duke's women's studies program to accuse him of racism in a letter to The Chronicle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these cases, liberals knowingly and falsely accused people of crimes for the purpose of self-gain. In the Georgetown Slattern case, a radio talk show host&#160; simply made a wisecrack. Sandra Fluke, not Limbaugh, told the country in open testimony that she consumes a thousand dollars worth of contraceptives a year. Ms. Fluke, not Limbaugh, demands that I pay for her contraceptives.&#160; And she&rsquo;s willing to, um, &ldquo;lend&rdquo; herself out to Congress and the media get her way.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran is ready to launch nuclear missiles, and the national debt is spinning wildly toward the point of no return.</p>
<p>Go, Rush!</p>
