<p>Is the US economy about to collapse worse the Greece&rsquo;s?&#160; </p>
<p>Some, like Paul Krugman, say that it&rsquo;s okay for governments to print unlimited money.&#160; Others, who have actually managed businesses, say otherwise.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ronald-reagan-david-stockman.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;" title="ronald-reagan-david-stockman" border="0" alt="ronald-reagan-david-stockman" align="left" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ronald-reagan-david-stockman_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="184" /></a>David Stockman is among the latter.&#160; He was Reagan&rsquo;s budget director for a few years.&#160; He became a media sensation because of his command of numbers. </strong></p>
<p>He left the White House early, fretting over federal debt.&#160; But debt in the 1980s was as a piggy bank to Wells Fargo. </p>
<p>In an interview with Business Insider, Stockman warned that America&rsquo;s financial end is nigh, and that you better hope the Lord returns before it gets here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here's the heart of the matter. <strong>The Fed is a patsy. It is a pathetic dependent of the big Wall Street banks, traders and hedge funds. Everything (it does) is designed to keep this rickety structure from unwinding.</strong> If you had a (former Fed Chairman) <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/paul-volcker">Paul Volcker</a> running the Fed today 7/8&mdash; utterly fearless and independent and willing to scare the hell out of the market any day of the week &mdash; you wouldn't have half, you wouldn't have 95 percent, of the speculative positions today. [Emphasis added]</p>

<p>The GOP is our best hope, but its candidates better get their brains around this, and fast.&#160; I really don&rsquo;t feel like spending the rest of&#160; my life foraging for roots and wrestling nuts from a squirrel. </p>
