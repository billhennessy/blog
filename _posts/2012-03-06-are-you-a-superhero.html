<p>This is a challenge. </p>
<p>I want you to grab a pen and paper (or open your favorite note app). Now write down a list of characteristic you&rsquo;d expect a <strong>superhero<em> </em></strong>to display. Write as many or as few as you&rsquo;d like.&#160; </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t continue until you&rsquo;ve written down the characteristics of a superhero. </p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/superhero.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="superhero" border="0" alt="Superhero You" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/superhero_thumb.jpg" width="547" height="328" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Welcome back.</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the next step. I want you to look over your list of superhero traits. As you do, <strong>think about the amount of that trait you have in you</strong>. </p>
<p>Make 0 through 5 scale, if you&rsquo;d like, and give yourself a grade for each trait.&#160; (Use a zero-based scale if you do, though.&#160; You probably don&rsquo;t have x-ray vision or eyeballs on your fingertips. Those traits would be zero on any scale.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet you have at least some level of one or more superhero traits, don&rsquo;t you? </p>
<p><strong>That means you can be a superhero.&#160; A real superhero.&#160; They&rsquo;ll make a movie about you someday. </strong></p>
<p>But they won&rsquo;t make a movie unless you use your superpower for good.&#160; </p>
<p>So you have one more task.</p>
<p><strong>Write down how you will use your superpower <em>today</em> to help preserve our republic</strong>.&#160; Write down only one, measurable, certain action you will do today that involves your superpower. </p>
<p>Then go do it.&#160; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. </p>
<p>BONUS:&#160; <strong>Tell us what your superpower is and how you used it today in the comments below</strong>.&#160; </p>
