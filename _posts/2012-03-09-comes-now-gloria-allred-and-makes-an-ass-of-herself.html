<p>The feminist attorney famous for making herself famous just couldn't let the Sandra Fluke case go.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/GloriaAllred.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="GloriaAllred" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/GloriaAllred-300x207.jpg" alt="Gloria Allread" width="300" height="207" /></a></p>
<p>Gloria Allred sent a letter to a Florida District Attorney asking him to arrest Rush Limbaugh for violation of an ancient Florida law.</p>
<blockquote><p>The statute stipulates that anyone who &ldquo;speaks of and concerning any woman, married or unmarried, falsely and maliciously imputing to her a want of chastity&rdquo; is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. Allred explained that the statute recently came to her attention as having never been repealed, and that it could very well apply to Limbaugh&rsquo;s remarks as his show is broadcast from West Palm Beach.</p>

<p><strong>Just one problem, Gloria: it looks to me that the truth would be a perfect defense for Rush. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The statute requires that the perp falsely impute a woman's "want of chastity." (That's "slutiness" for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2007/11/30/rio_linda_explained_for_those_in_rio_linda">those of you in Rio Linda.</a>) &nbsp;But Ms. Fluke has pretty much handed Rush his defense with her public comments. &nbsp;<strong>Unmarried women in possession of their chastity don't need $3,000 worth of contraceptives.</strong></p>
<p>Another thing: Did Ms. Allred ask Sandra Fluke if she wanted her help? &nbsp;The answer is "no."</p>
<blockquote><p>[Allred] said Friday that she has not yet been in touch with Fluke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reach out to women, they reach out to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If she did reach out to me, obviously I would respond.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Maybe Ms. Fluke doesn't want her sex life to become an artifact of discovery in a criminal trial in Florida.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the DA prosecutes Rush, and his best defense is the truth, then Sandra&nbsp;<a href="http://hennessysview.com/news/how-rush-limbaugh-revived-chivalry/">Fluke's chastity will be on trial as much as Rush's speech</a>.</p>
