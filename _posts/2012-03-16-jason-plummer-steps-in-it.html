<p>When you&rsquo;re the Republican Establishment&rsquo;s candidate, you have one simple assignment: don&rsquo;t screw up.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/gop-elephant-dead.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="gop-elephant-dead" border="0" alt="gop-elephant-dead" align="left" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/gop-elephant-dead_thumb.jpg" width="240" height="214" /></a>Jason Plummer, a 29-year-old lumber heir, is the GOP Establishment&rsquo;s appointed candidate for US Congress in Illinois&rsquo; 12th Congressional District.&#160; He&rsquo;s facing a shockingly tough race from former police detective and former Belleville Mayor, <a href="http://cookforcongress.org/" target="_blank">Rodger Cook</a>.&#160; (Never underestimate a detective&rsquo;s tenacity.)</p>
<p>In a debate last week, Plummer failed his one simple assignment.&#160; Despite a nearly unlimited war chest from his family&rsquo;s fortune and the Illinois GOP treasury, Plummer said something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Plummer accused FamilyPAC of taking bribes.&#160; </strong></p>
<p>FamilyPAC is one of the most active conservative political action committees in Illinois. Republicans for every office look to the organization for its pro-life stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Plummer failed to impress FamilyPAC&rsquo;s endorsement when he ran for Lieutenant Governor 2010. According to the stltoday.com, Paul Caprio, head of FamilyPAC, was unimpressed with Plummer: </p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I had the feeling he was green, politically,&rdquo; Caprio said. &ldquo;. . . I just came to the conclusion that this young man is not ready to be running for lieutenant governor.&rdquo;      <br />Read more: <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/conservative-group-demands-apology-over-endorsements-for-cash-allegation/article_bdb4ca20-6d5c-11e1-995f-001a4bcf6878.html#ixzz1pHooDJWb">http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/conservative-group-demands-apology-over-endorsements-for-cash-allegation/article_bdb4ca20-6d5c-11e1-995f-001a4bcf6878.html#ixzz1pHooDJWb</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Plummer failed to gain FamilyPAC&rsquo;s nod, he went berserk according to Caprio:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was very irate. He was threatening, `I&rsquo;m never going to forget this, I&rsquo;m going to get back at you,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Caprio.</p>

<p><a href="http://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2012/02/video-adam-andrzejewski-praises-rodger.html" target="_blank">Rodger Cook has already earned Adam Andrzejewski&rsquo;s pr</a>aise, in part because of Rodger&rsquo;s transparency. By highlighting the Rodger Cook&rsquo;s maturity and integrity, Plummer&rsquo;s latest gaffe may bring on even<strong> more high-profile conservative endorsements for Cook</strong>.</p>

<p>The Illinois Primary is next Tuesday, March 20.&#160; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cookforcongress" target="_blank">Rodger Cook</a> and the other GOP candidates hope to replace long-time Democrate, Jerry Costello, who is retiring after this term.</p>
