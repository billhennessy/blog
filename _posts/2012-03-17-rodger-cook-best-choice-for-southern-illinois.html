<p><a href="http://cookforcongress.org/" target="_blank">Rodger Cook</a> fools no one into thinking he&rsquo;s a member of the political class.&#160; He&rsquo;s not. Rodger&rsquo;s a human being, like the rest of us.&#160; That&rsquo;s just one of the reasons that <strong>Rodger Cook has earned my personal endorsement in next Tuesday&rsquo;s (March 20) Illinois primary.*</strong></p>

<p>Actually, Rodger&rsquo;s not so much like the rest of us.&#160; Rodger has served the people of Illinois all of his adult life.&#160; Rodger has been a police officer, a detective, a mayor, and private businessman.&#160; He&rsquo;s an inventor&mdash;creating the world&rsquo;s first one-page softball score book for keeping score easier.&#160; (I love this idea&mdash;you never have to put your beer down!)&#160; </p>
<p>As mayor of Belleville, the largest city in Illinois&rsquo; 12th district, Cook ran up an amazing string of promises kept, including improving relations with city workers, expanding the city, and fixing Belleville&rsquo;s fiscal mess. That last skill will be vital in Washington, DC, for the next two years.</p>
<p>Rodger is founder of Metro East Fellowship of Christian Athletes and long-time member of the St. Louis area chapter.&#160; He has <em>earned</em> the trust and endorsement of numerous conservative, pro-life, and family organizations, including FamilyPAC.&#160; He has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police.&#160; </p>
<p>Everyone in America will thank the people of southern Illinois when they send Rodger Cook to Congress in 2012. </p>
