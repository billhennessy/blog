<p>Go vote, please.&#160; Please.&#160; Vote now. Don&rsquo;t Put It Off!!&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Did you know that ObamaCare is my fault?</strong>&#160; </p>
<p>Of course, it is.&#160; Read my story below the clock.</p>

<p><strong>I didn&rsquo;t vote in 2006.&#160; You know why?&#160; </strong></p>
<p>I put it off. </p>
<p>I decided not to stop on my way to work in the morning.&#160; Why? <em>I&rsquo;ll have plenty of time tonight, </em>I thought. <em>I&rsquo;ll stop on my way home</em>.</p>
<p>But guess what.</p>
<p>An emergency at work.&#160; I didn&rsquo;t get out until 6:30.&#160; </p>
<p>I still had time, but it was raining.&#160; And there was major construction on my default path home.&#160; And between the rain and traffic and dark and leaves, two cars collided. </p>
<p>I got to the polling place&mdash;drove past it&mdash;at 7:18.&#160; </p>
<p>What happened?&#160; </p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi became Speaker.&#160; The economy tanked. Obamacare passed. </p>
<p>Blame it on me. </p>
<p><strong>Just don&rsquo;t burden yourself with guilt like mine.&#160; </strong></p>
<p>Vote early. Carry out your duty.&#160; Exercise your privilege.&#160; </p>
<p>Vote.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>And vote for </strong><a href="http://cookforcongress.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Rodger Cook</strong></a><strong> for Congress in IL-12. </strong></p>
