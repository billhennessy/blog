<p>Covenant of Liberty is the best American history I&rsquo;ve read in years. </p>
<p>Michael Patrick Leahy, among a very small group of patriots who hatched the first round of Tea Parties in February 2009, documents the US Government&rsquo;s 230 year history of Constitutional infidelity. </p>
<p>My full review will be finished soon, but don&rsquo;t wait: buy Covenant of Liberty today. </p>

<p>Mike Leahy was the keynote speaker on day one of the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party in St. Louis and has been a great friend and ally to STLTPC in our continuing fight for liberty. </p>
<p><strong>Buy TWO copies&mdash;one to keep and one to lend.&#160; Everyone needs to read this Covenant of Liberty. </strong></p>
