<p>I&rsquo;m often amazed at the weakness of arguments before the Supreme Court. Today, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, attempting to help out the Obama Administration&rsquo;s fumbling solicitor-general, made the weakest argument I&rsquo;ve<a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ginsburg.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0; border-width: 0;" title="Ruth Bader Ginsberg" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ginsburg_thumb.jpg" alt="Ruth Bader Ginsberg" width="206" height="240" align="right" border="0" /></a> ever heard.</p>
<p>First,Ginsburg statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Verrilli, I thought that your main point is that, unlike food or any other&nbsp;&nbsp; market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, even though you have every intent in the world to self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you may not have the money.<br />

<p><strong>Ginsburg accurately described the government&rsquo;s case. But in so doing, she <em>made</em> the plaintiffs&rsquo; case.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Food is at least as important as medical care.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food is a vital necessity.</li>
<li>Food can be provided from a variety of sources.</li>
<li>People can honestly intend to provide for their own food and fail.</li>
<li>When people are unable to feed themselves&mdash;when their crops fail, the goat dies, etc.&mdash;other people feel compelled to help them.&nbsp; (Thank God, literally.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ginsburg and Solicitor-General Verilli insult our intelligence in their arguments.&nbsp; They seem to say that medical care is more necessary to life than food. Yet, without food, we die.</p>
<p>I can fully intend to feed myself. I buy chickens for eggs and meat, goats for milk. I plant a huge, beautiful garden with heirloom seeds. I dig a well. Then someone steals my goats, the chickens die of some communicable chicken disease, and a hail storm destroys my garden.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>maybe the Obama Administration and Ginsburg aren&rsquo;t arguing this case&mdash;maybe they&rsquo;re arguing the next one, when HHS and FDA order us to buy certain foods. </strong></p>
<p>The argument that medical care&mdash;or, more accurately, medical insurance&mdash;is unique holds no water. If it&rsquo;s unfair to burden the insured with the medical costs of the uninsured, it&rsquo;s unfair to burden the well fed with the food costs of the unfed. Fairness is independent of government&rsquo;s involvement.</p>
<p>But that simple truth&mdash;like most truths in life--is too much for totalitarian worldview shared byGinsburg, Verilli, and Obama.</p>
