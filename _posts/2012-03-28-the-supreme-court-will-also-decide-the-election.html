<p>When the Supreme Court rules on ObamaCare, it will define Barack Obama as either a winner or loser. </p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/vertigo-photo-4.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="Balance" border="0" alt="Balance" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/vertigo-photo-4_thumb.jpg" width="634" height="476" /></a></p>
<p>James Carville says overturning ObamaCare would be the best thing that could happen to Democrats. I think he&rsquo;s wrong. </p>
<p>ObamaCare is the centerpiece of Obama&rsquo;s term in office. He put all of America&rsquo;s business on hold for a year to pass it. He coerced, lied, intimidated, and threatened to get the law passed.&#160; It consumed him.</p>
<p><strong>If Barack Obama&rsquo;s only major accomplishment turns out to be a very divisive, very expensive, very distracting assault on the Constitution, the only word that will fit him is &ldquo;loser.&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p>But if Anthony Kennedy can be persuaded to break the Constitution, Obama will be, more or less, our dictator. If the law is upheld, people will see him as a winner because people flock to power. </p>
<p><strong>The republic hangs in the balance.</strong></p>
