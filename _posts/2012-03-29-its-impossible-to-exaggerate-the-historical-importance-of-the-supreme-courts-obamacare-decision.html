<p>When the Supreme Court releases its opinion on the ObamaCare case, America will change fundamentally. This is the most important case to the future of the republic since the Great Depression or the Civil War.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/obamacare-pace-car.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;margin:0 0 0 5px;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="Official ObamaCare Pace Car" border="0" alt="Official ObamaCare Pace Car" align="right" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/obamacare-pace-car_thumb.jpg" width="344" height="271" /></a>&#160;<strong>If the court upholds ObamaCare, it will end the principle of government limited by a written Constitution</strong>.&#160; Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia said as much. A vote by Kennedy to uphold the legislation, then, would be a vote for unlimited government power. <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2012/03/28/paul-clement-whats-at-stake-here-is-the-basic-nature-of-our-government/">As Allahpundit puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What they&rsquo;re [Obama&rsquo;s lawyers] asking for, in other words, even though they can&rsquo;t phrase it this way, is a waiver from the Commerce Clause because this boondoggle is <i>that</i> important.<strong> And Kennedy, per his &ldquo;heavy burden of justification&rdquo; reasoning, just might give it to them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>If, however, the court strikes down ObamaCare, everything that the Tea Party fought for for the past three years will have been vindicated by the highest court in the land.</strong> America&rsquo;s closest brush with totalitarianism will have been averted. </p>
<p>For 100 years, progressives have beaten the American people to the ground and stolen our power. They&rsquo;ve stored all this power in Washington, DC. From 1942 to about 1982, the courts were allies of progressivism.&#160; Since then, the courts have been relatively neutral, occasionally transferring more power to the government, rarely returning power to the people, mostly maintaining a cumbersome status quo.</p>
<p>This case changes everything. Either we have a Constitution or we don&rsquo;t. </p>
