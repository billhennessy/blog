<p>First, my prediction:</p>
<p>1) Is Obamacare a tax? (8-1 Against)</p>
<p>Technically speaking, if Obamacare is a tax, it could be non-justiciable until implementation.&#160; However, judicial precedence suggests the courts may review a tax before its implementation in certain circumstances.&#160; The Government did not even want to argue that Obamacare was a tax, so the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) appointed a separate attorney to make the argument.&#160; The only SCOTUS justice that appeared to entertain this line was Justice Breyer.</p>
<p>2) Is the mandate unconstitutional? (5-4&#160; For)</p>
<p>3) Is the mandate severable? (7-2 Against)</p>
<p>CITIZENS UNITED</p>
<p>It is not judicial restraint to accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument with broader implications.&#160; Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling.</p>
<p>We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers.&#160; <strong>Both history and logic lead us to this conclusion.</strong></p>
