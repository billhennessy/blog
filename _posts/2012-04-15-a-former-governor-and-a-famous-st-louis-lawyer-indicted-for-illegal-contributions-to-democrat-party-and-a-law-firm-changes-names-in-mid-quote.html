<p>Everyone else is writing about the news that <a href="http://fox2now.com/2012/04/12/grand-jury-indicts-former-gov-roger-wilsom/">former Missouri Democrat Governor, Roger Wilson and local lawyer Ed Griesedieck Jr. were indicted on federal fraud charges today</a>.</p>
<p>The two allegedly made contributions to the Democrat Party (legal), and reimbursed themselves out of Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company&rsquo;s coffers (illegal).</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the weird part.&nbsp; After all, election fraud is the Democrats&rsquo; principal form of amusement.</p>
<p>The weird part is the statement from Griesedieck&rsquo;s law firm. In the statement, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2012/04/12/ed-griesedieck-roger-wilson-indicted.html">the firm changes spelling of its name in the middle of a paragraph from St. Louis Business Journal</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ed-griesedieck-roger-wilson-indicted-by-feds-st-louis-business-journal.png"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="Ed Griesedieck, Roger Wilson indicted by feds - St. Louis Business Journal" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ed-griesedieck-roger-wilson-indicted-by-feds-st-louis-business-journal_thumb.png" alt="Ed Griesedieck, Roger Wilson indicted by feds - St. Louis Business Journal" width="378" height="246" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just a typo by the BizJournal.com&mdash;like the 1.2 million typos I&rsquo;ve committed on this blog in the past 12 years.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if Mr. Crebs was so appalled by the scandal that he changed his name to Krebs.</p>
