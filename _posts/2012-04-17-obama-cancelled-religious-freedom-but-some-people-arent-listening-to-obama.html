<p>When Obama decreed that Catholics shall support and provide chemical abortions,<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012-election/how-you-can-save-religious-freedom-in-america/"> he wasn't promoting women. He was shackling religion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Totalitarian autocrats don't cotton freedom, unless they personally granted it.</strong> &nbsp;Obama doesn't believe in individual liberty, but that all power and rights&nbsp;emanate&nbsp;from government. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/03/cardinal-dolan-blasts-obamas-contraception-plan-as-freedom-of-religion-battle-video/">Timothy Cardinal Dolan agrees</a>.</p>
<p>So it's exciting to report that some St. Louisans are fighting back. &nbsp;Here's the details:</p>
<p><strong>Protest for Religious Freedom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Courthouse&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stl-defenders.com/index.cfm?load=eventlocation&amp;location=12&amp;page=1&amp;category=1" target="_blank">(Directions)</a><br />
<strong>Date:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday, April 28, 2012<br />
<strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM</p>
<p>Our rally outside a government building will be held on April 28th at 11:00 a.m.-12:00 noon. &nbsp;We will have an outstanding list of speakers at this event. &nbsp;<strong>Zip Rzeppa will be our Master of Ceremony.</strong></p>
<p>Religious and Tea Party Leaders will encourage us to press for religious freedom.</p>
<p><strong>The event will be held at the Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis</strong>.&nbsp; Please plan on arriving early to find parking as the Cardinals play the Milwaukee Brewers at 12:05 that same day.</p>
