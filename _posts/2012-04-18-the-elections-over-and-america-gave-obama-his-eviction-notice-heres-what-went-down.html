<p>The look on George &ldquo;Stephie&rdquo; Stephanopoulos&rsquo;s face was priceless. He had to say it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>ABC News now projects that President Obama will go down to defeat</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to say, &ldquo;Romney won&rdquo; or &ldquo;Republicans won.&rdquo;&nbsp; He just couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The network analysis was a political clich&eacute; run amok. My favorite came from James Carville who told CNN viewers that the election result &ldquo;proves that crackers and racists vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrea Mitchell: &ldquo;Usually in a democracy, you get the government you deserve. In this case, America reject the government so desperately needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolff Blitzer: &ldquo;<strong>The Obama era&rsquo;s days are numbered, and America&rsquo;s might be, too</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As map turned red in key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Florida, the anchors turned a sickly shade of white on NBC, MSNBC, CNN, ABC, and CBS.&nbsp; Jesse Jackson announced on CNN that &ldquo;I am too distraught to rhyme because this election was a wrongdoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it came about.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-ate-a-dog-conservatives-response-to-mitt-romney-seamus-2012-4">Obama ate dog</a>. Sure, Romney gave into his dog&rsquo;s desire to ride on the roof of the car, but Obama ATE dog. Dog meat turns off voters.</li>
<li>Romney Ran Right. Independents want a president with commitment and competence.&nbsp; They are right of center, but they&rsquo;ll vote left if the right disappoints. Candy-ass centrist Republicans disappointment, so they vote for the Dem.&nbsp; But Romney ran toward the right, locking in the Reagan Democrats and independents.</li>
<li>Obama&rsquo;s presidency was incompetent, narcissistic, arrogant, and anti-American.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not a good combination.</li>
<li>Popular and effective conservative governors, Senators, and representatives did a fabulous job promoting other conservatives instead of running up their own scores or buying favors from moderates.</li>
<li>Ron Paul visibly worked for Romney and Republicans on the under card.</li>
<li><strong>The Supreme Court rules Obama attempted, and failed, to corrupt the Constitution through Obamacare</strong>, uncovering for many Obama&rsquo;s authoritarian aims.</li>
<li>The economy sputtered.</li>
<li>Some Democrats, fearing the gallows of history, refused to endorse or openly abandoned Obama.</li>
<li><strong>Tea Partiers realized that four more year of Obama would leave their children and grandchildren living like the Soviets</strong> . . . and supported the Republicans big time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Less than six months&rsquo; time separates us from November.&nbsp; This scenario, frankly, is far less probable than <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/04/15/the-elections-over-and-the-republicans-got-creamed-heres-what-went-wrong/">my previous scenario in which the GOP gets slaughtered.</a>&nbsp; But this one is plausible.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing you can do to produce this outcome instead of the other? </strong></p>
