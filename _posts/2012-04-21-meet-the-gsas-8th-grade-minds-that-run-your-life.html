<p>There are two kinds of people in America: those who grow up to become productive adults, and those who become bureaucrats.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-neely-gsa-hearings-pleads-the-fifth-amendment-2012-4">The GSA scandal lit up the 3 Stooges mentality</a> of the "men and women" who would run every aspect of your life if Obama and his czars get their way.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jeff-neely1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12069" title="jeff-neely-soaking-taxpayers" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jeff-neely1.jpg" alt="Bureacrat Jeff Neely soaking the taxpayers in Vegas" width="478" height="269" /></a></p>
<p>Jeff Neely's the guy Thomas Jefferson had in mind when wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people,&nbsp;and eat out their substance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neely and his wife showed no shame in living like Donald Trump on taxpayers' dollars. They posted these photos on Google+.</p>

<p>When you meet one of those undecided voters this year, the ones whose white guilt wants to give Obama four more years to destroy America, show them these pictures of the people who eat the food they can't afford to feed their kids.</p>
<p>Then there's Martha Johnson, appointed by both Clinton and Obama to bureaucratic leadership. &nbsp;While she "will mourn for the rest of my life the loss of my appointment," she still saw fit to give Neely a fat tax dollar bonus for his work in staging the Vegas&nbsp;boondoggle.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/gsa-scandal-powerful-powerless-players-181754722.html">On the flip side, there were heroes, like Susan Brita</a>, the whistleblower who uncovered the nonsense. Trouble is, in a bureacracy, it's the &nbsp;arrogant swine like Neely who tend to rise to the top--the ones who believe, like their White House leaders, that&nbsp;bureaucrats&nbsp;are the moral superiors of the subjects, the serfs, the commoners.</p>
<p>If we don't clean house this November, we deserve the gulag we'll surely inhabit.</p>
