<p>The only surprise here is that the NYT's own ombudsman admits that the paper is Obama's best friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many critics view <strong>The Times as constitutionally unable to address the election in an unbiased fashion</strong>. Like a lot of America, it basked a bit in the warm glow of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s election in 2008. The company published a book about the country&rsquo;s first African-American president,&nbsp;&ldquo;Obama: The Historic Journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;The Times also published&nbsp;a lengthy portrait of him&nbsp;in its Times Topics section on&nbsp;NYTimes.com, yet there&rsquo;s nothing of the kind about&nbsp;George W. Bush&nbsp;or&nbsp;his father. [emphasis added]</p>

<p>Another reason why <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/04/22/democrats-committed-massive-vote-fraud-in-2008-theyll-do-it-again-in-2012-and-few-people-care/">few people get worked up when Democrats stuff ballot boxes in key swing states</a>.</p>
