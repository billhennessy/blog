<p>What I find so funny about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-claire-mccaskill-takes-fight-to-super-pacs-as-missouri-swings-farther-right/2012/04/22/gIQAqoAmaT_story.html">Claire McCaskill's war on super pacs</a> is that her husband <em>is</em> a super PAC.</p>
<p>For the record, I have formally endorsed Senator McCaskill in her race to return to private life.</p>
<h3>Zimmerman Update</h3>
<p>Having declared George Zimmerman guilty of first degree, racially motivated murder, the MSM are now investigating the case.</p>
<p>What they're finding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The George Zimmerman that Francescani describes is quite different from the "delusional racist vigilante" that many have made him out to be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Conservatives didn't pre-judge Zimmerman the way liberals did. &nbsp;Maybe because studies show we are</p>
<blockquote><p>better informed, more intellectually consistent, more open-minded, more empathetic and more receptive to criticism than their fellow Americans who support the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>(BTW, narrow-minded liberals&nbsp;<em>hate it</em> when you remind them that they're narrow-minded, uninformed, and less receptive to criticism. So don't do that.)</p>
<h3>So, to mayor. Or Sotomayor</h3>
<p>Being the eternal optimist, I'm holding out hope that Sonia Sotomayor could flip right one day. &nbsp;On Wednesday, my silly dream got a bump.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in Obama vs. The People of Arizona. &nbsp;(I know that's not the actual caption, but it should be.) Justice <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-immigration-law-arguments-shredded-even-by-liberal-justices-2012-4" target="_blank">Sotomayor "shredded" the U.S. government's crappy case, in Business Insider's view</a>. &nbsp;Quoting Sotomayor:</p>
<blockquote><p>Putting aside your argument that this --&nbsp;that a systematic cooperation is wrong --&nbsp;<strong>you can see&nbsp;it's not selling very well -- why don't you try to come&nbsp;up with something else? [emphasis original].</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>On her first day on the court, she questioned whether corporations really should have the same rights as humans who never die. &nbsp;For many libertarians, that's a question worth exploring. &nbsp; (But that's a huge conversation for another day.)</p>
<p>Exit question: <strong>&nbsp;has Donald Verrilli argued his last case before the Supreme Court?</strong> &nbsp; I can't imagine that Obama will accept the blame for<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/03/27/why-people-are-being-unfair-to-donal-verrilli/" target="_blank"> giving Verrilli impossible assignments in this and Obamacare cases</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe the real reason <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/04/22/democrats-committed-massive-vote-fraud-in-2008-theyll-do-it-again-in-2012-and-few-people-care/">Obama wants more illegals in the U.S. is to stuff ballot boxes in November</a>.</p>
