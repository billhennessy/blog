<p>The new fad among Democrats is to see <strong>how many illegal aliens they can pack into a voting booth</strong>. &nbsp;While we conservatives decry this illegal and anti-American grab at tyrannical power, we should take some solace in this sobering fact: those illegal aliens probably know as much about the American political system as most 13th generation Americans.</p>

<p>The fact is, <strong>most Americans are too stupid about politics to vote</strong>, which explains the 2008 election.</p>
<p>Just look at these <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/one-in-three-americans-fail-immigrant-naturalization-civics-test-149209975.html" target="_blank">horrendous numbers from Xavier University</a>:</p>
<p>For example, when asked questions about our government and political leaders, the survey results found:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>85% did not know the meaning of the "the rule of law."</li>
<li><strong>82% could not name "two rights stated in the Declaration of Independence."</strong></li>
<li>75% were not able to correctly answer "What does the judiciary branch do?"</li>
<li><strong>71% were unable to identify the Constitution as the "supreme law of the land."</strong></li>
<li>68% did not know how many justices are on the Supreme Court.</li>
<li>63% could not name one of their two US Senators.</li>
<li><strong>62% could not identify "What happened at the Constitutional Convention?"</strong></li>
<li>62% could not answer "the name of the Speaker of the US House."</li>
</ul>
<p>Who doesn't want the highest possible number of people to vote? &nbsp;I don't.</p>
<p>My vote should not have to compete with that of a moron who can't blurt out "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" when asked to name the rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. (A "moron" is someone with a mental age between 8 and 12, for those of you who vote Democrat.)</p>
<p><strong>If you don't know that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, you should not be allowed to vote--photo ID or not</strong>. &nbsp;Nor should your political opinions carry weight among the 15 percent in this country who actually know something.</p>
<p>Combined with another survey released last week showing that<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/04/22/science-say-gop-voters-better-informed-open-minded/" target="_blank"> liberals are politically ignorant, closed-minded, judgmental, hate-mongers</a>, you realize that the voting franchise has been diluted too far.</p>
