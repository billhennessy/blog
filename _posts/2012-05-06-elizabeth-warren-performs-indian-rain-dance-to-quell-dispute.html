<p>Cambridge, MA&mdash;Massachusetts Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren donned a pink headdress and performed, what she called, an &ldquo;authentic Indian rain dance&rdquo; during a press conference today.&nbsp; Ms Warren was hoping to convince skeptics of her claims of Native American heritage. She also hinted that her preference for bison meat to beef indicates her heritage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pepaw taught me this dance when I was a little girl,&rdquo; Warren said during a short session with reporters at a high school gymnasium in Cambridge, MA. &ldquo;It was during that huge draught back in the late fifties in Oklahoma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was eating bison burgers when most white men considered it poison,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I actually prefer bison to beef, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://bostonherald.com/news/politics/view/20220428liz_has_no_reservations_on_native_status_brown_warren_spar_as_records_released" target="_blank">the Boston Herald reported that Warren once listed herself as Native American</a> on Harvard&rsquo;s faculty information form.&nbsp; Later, the woman who hopes to unseat Republican Senator Scott Brown, stopped claiming minority status.</p>
<p>Since the story broke, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-native-american-problem-scott-brown-winning-massachusetts-senate-race-2012-5" target="_blank">each of Warren&rsquo;s attempts to explain her 1990s claims of minority status have raised more questions than they answered</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be offended, but I think she&rsquo;s embarrassing herself far more than she&rsquo;s embarrassing native peoples,&rdquo; said Ben Silverhawk, president of Native People&rsquo;s Defense Fund.&nbsp; &ldquo;After this, no one will try to exploit Natives for political or professional gain, I&rsquo;m pretty sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warren hopes to end the controversy later this week when she holds a free screening of <em>Dances With Wolves</em> at AMC Loews Harvard Square Theatre.&nbsp; Show times and ticket availability have not been announced.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the National Weather Service calls for a chance of showers today but clearing skies tomorrow with highs in the upper 50s.</p>
