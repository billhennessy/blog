<p>In 2008, we heard all about the youth movement for Obama. &nbsp;We heard that the enormous Millennial Generation, born between 1982 and 2001, would destroy the GOP and everything America once stood for--like jobs, family, faith, and hard work. &nbsp;And when Obama won, many believed the tales of the Obama Youth.</p>

<p>But many were wrong. <strong>Voters under 30 have had it with vague promises and glittering bullshit from that punk from Chicago</strong>.</p>
<p>Meet Crossroads Generation (XG for short). &nbsp;<a href="http://crossroadsgeneration.com/" target="_blank">Crossroads Generation is a great sign for America's future</a>. XG's existence shows that Millennials understand how the world works and are willing to fix problems when they arise, just like the 13 previous American generations.</p>
<p>Here's the stuff that has Millennials up in arms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student load debt exceeds $1 trillion, and the cost of education is increase twice as fast as healthcare</li>
<li>One-third of college graduates are unemployed</li>
<li>42% of college grads under 30 have returned to their parents' homes</li>
<li>1/2 of young people didn't go to work on a given day of the week</li>
<li>Unemployment rate among Millennials is 25%, double that of any other group, including blacks</li>
</ul>
<p>Obama promised 5.5% unemployment by 2012. He promised to hold unemployment under 8.0 with the Stimulus. &nbsp;<strong>Obama failed. Obama made it worse.</strong> &nbsp;<strong>And millions of frustrated young people who want to work but can't are holding him accountable.</strong></p>

<p>If the world's debt-driven economy tanks this year (and there's a 50% chance), &nbsp;Obama be driven out on a rail. His champions, the Millennials, will do the driving.</p>
