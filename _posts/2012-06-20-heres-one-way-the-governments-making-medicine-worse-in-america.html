<p>I had to go to the doctor today. The reason's not important. &nbsp;Here's what is:</p>
<p><strong>It took my doctor 10 minutes to describe my symptoms into a government-mandated voice recognition system. &nbsp;<a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/04_dictaphone.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-12170 alignleft" style="margin-right:10px;" title="04_dictaphone" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/04_dictaphone.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="356" /></a></strong></p>
<p>In the old days, the doctor took notes. &nbsp;Now, he has to recite his observations into a Mad Men-era dictaphone. "Male, age 48, blood pressure one-twenty-one over seventy-three . . . "</p>
<p><strong>The damn machine (government medical technology) couldn't understand half the doctor's words.</strong> &nbsp;And they were household words, like "absent," "weight-lifter," and "bleeding."</p>
<p>This is the DMV in your doctor's office. &nbsp;This is bureau-care. &nbsp;This is Obamacare--a ten minute exam stretched to twenty with aggravation driven through the roof.</p>
<p>Let's pray like mad the Supreme Court's ruling will rule Obamacare unconstitutional. &nbsp;And I wouldn't mind it if the majority opinion included a second opinion: "And it's stupid."</p>
<p>BTW, The After Party is at<strong> Helen Fitzgerald's at 7 tonight</strong> (Thursday, June 21). And the LATimes believes the<strong> Supreme Court could hand down its Obamacare ruling</strong> today (Thursday). &nbsp;That makes The After Party your chance to <strong>celebrate victory</strong> or plot our next move.</p>
<p>See you Helen's at 7.</p>
