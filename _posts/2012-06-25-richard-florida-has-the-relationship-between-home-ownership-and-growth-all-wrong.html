<p>In a column intended to attract readers, not to promote hard economics, Rotman University economist Richard Florida declares that home ownership is terrible for the US Economy.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/19602.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="19602" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/19602_thumb.jpg" alt="19602" width="504" height="347" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The problem is, like many economists,<strong> Florida&rsquo;s understanding of home ownership is 180 degrees ass-backwards</strong>.&nbsp; Florida thinks that home ownership is supposed to <em>cause</em> economic growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of leading to economic development, higher rates of homeownership today are associated with lower levels of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, professor.&nbsp; <strong>Home ownership is the <em>reward</em> for economic growth in healthy systems</strong>.&nbsp; In the 1990s and 2000s, however, government mandates more or less forced people to buy homes and forced banks to lend to anyone.&nbsp; That drove up the home ownership percentage without the organic economic growth to justify it.</p>
<p><strong>Once we unwind from 20 years of bad Washington policy, home ownership will once again signal a health economy and stable neighborhoods</strong>.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;d help us get government and crony big bankers out of the way, we&rsquo;ll restore housing equilibrium and a vibrant economy in no time.</p>
