<p>I love some things about Business Insider.&nbsp; Mostly its great headlines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes its writers show an ignorance of basic economics in their rush to catapult Obama to a second term.&nbsp; Joe Weisenthal is just the latest example.</p>
<p>Joe tries to claim that economic recovery in the US is retarded by loss of public sector jobs.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jobs.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="jobs" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jobs_thumb.jpg" alt="jobs" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>What Joe doesn&rsquo;t seem to get is this:&nbsp; <strong>the private sector pays for those public sector jobs</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll break it down for the journalism majors.</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing&nbsp; that governments produce that <a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pentagons-map-53972.html">the market values is security</a><strong></strong>.&nbsp; People will pay for military, intelligence, police, fire, and prisons.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why the founders and the philosophers they quoted talked endlessly about government&rsquo;s limited role of preserving liberty, peace, contracts, and safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the market will pay for those things.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Everything else government does is overhead.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>In good times, the people who actually produce our GDP,&nbsp; private sector workers plus government security workers, put up with massive, overbearing government overhead.&nbsp; We shouldn&rsquo;t but we do.</p>
<p><strong>When times get bad, though, we stop paying for the luxury of government overhead</strong>.&nbsp; The private sector can&rsquo;t afford to pay for government services that the market refuses to buy from private providers.</p>
<p>The charts Weisenthal posted are meaningless.&nbsp; They show only that a bloated public sector is shrinking as the market refuses to support wasteful government programs and bureaucracies.&nbsp; Considering that&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/income/2010-08-10-1Afedpay10_ST_N.htm">government employees earn double what private sector workers make</a>, anyone can understand why this country&rsquo;s producers have had it with big government.</p>
<p>Bottom line: government work does not grow the economy, except for security, so every job gained in the public sector is future opportunity denied in the overall economy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obamas-first-term-and-bushs-first-term-2012-6">the BI story</a>.</p>
