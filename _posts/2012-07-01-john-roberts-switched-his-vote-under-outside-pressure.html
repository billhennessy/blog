<p>It won&rsquo;t look like decay to many.&nbsp; John Roberts will be the toast of the political class for years to come. He&rsquo;ll attend all the prettiest events with the prettiest people. Barbara Streisand will have him out to her massively carbon-releasing Hollywood mansion.&nbsp; The Washington Post intelligentsia will place his bust in its pantheon of The Evolved.&nbsp; He might even golf with Bill and Obama.</p>

<p>But beneath the black robe grows a dark stain on his soul.&nbsp; Day by day,&nbsp; decision by decision, the stain metastasizes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll look at his grand kids and wonder how they&rsquo;ll react when they learn that their grandpa betrayed his conscience and his country to avoid scorn from the political class. What will his great-grandchildren&rsquo;s textbooks say about him?</p>
<p>And what of his country?&nbsp; Will his&nbsp; moral collapse speed America&rsquo;s descent into totalitarianism?&nbsp; Maybe the government&rsquo;s textbook writers will treat him with favor.</p>
<p>Or will his old team prevail?&nbsp; The team of rugged individualism and the power of principle.&nbsp; Will America somehow rally and recover its former greatness?&nbsp; And if so, how will our future history books represent the Supreme Court Chief Justice who couldn&rsquo;t take the heat of Chicago politics in Washington?&nbsp; How will our side describe the justice who caved?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57464549/roberts-switched-views-to-uphold-health-care-law/?pageNum=2&amp;tag=contentMain;contentBody" target="_blank">We know now that Roberts switched his vote under intense pressure from the White House and from the press</a>.&nbsp; He sold out the more than 60% of Americans who oppose socialize medicine in order to win favor with the 8% known as the &ldquo;political class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CBS News reports the extent of Roberts&rsquo; ostracization from the court&rsquo;s conservatives:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that the joint dissent doesn't mention Roberts' majority was not a sign of sloppiness, the sources said, but instead was a signal <strong>the conservatives no longer wished to engage in debate with him</strong>. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>Roberts is now a man without a country, without a cause, and without a confederate. The liberals don&rsquo;t need him, and the conservatives can&rsquo;t trust him.</p>
<p>I suspect history will be very unkind to John Roberts, no matter how America ends. History is unkind to cowards.</p>
