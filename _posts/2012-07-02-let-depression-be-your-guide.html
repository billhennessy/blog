<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/06/30/heres-whats-great-about-the-supreme-courts-obamacare-decision/" target="_blank">I gave you a reason to celebrate the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision</a>.&nbsp; But I never said to let go of your anger or depression. <strong> That&rsquo;s because we need creativity, focus, and action, and you get those through emotional distress. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/depression-treatment1.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="Depression-treatment1" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/depression-treatment1_thumb.jpg" alt="Depression-treatment1" width="404" height="304" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In his new best-selling book, Jonah Lehrer discusses the link between depression and creativity:</p>
<blockquote><p>This helps explain why Forgas has found that states of sadness&mdash; he induces the downcast mood with a film about death and cancer&mdash; also correlate with better writing samples; subjects compose sentences that are clearer and more compelling. Because they were more attentive to what they were writing, they produced more refined prose, the words polished by their misery.</p>
<p>Lehrer, Jonah (2012-03-19). Imagine: How Creativity Works (p. 77). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wanna feel some depression? Think about this:&nbsp; since July of 2009, we&rsquo;ve been fighting against Obamacare. For almost a full year, we spent many hours every week in the streets trying to block Obama&rsquo;s power grab.</p>
<p>After the Senate crammed through hastily written legislation in March 2010, we looked toward the Supreme Court as our next line defense.&nbsp; When <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/03/27/why-people-are-being-unfair-to-donal-verrilli/">Richard Verilli, the government&rsquo;s lawyer</a>, failed miserably in his oral arguments in March, we felt a quiet confidence build inside our guts: Obamacare would be toast.</p>
<p>Then came June. Each Monday and Thursday we waited to hear the news. But the news didn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe next week,&rdquo; we told each other.</p>
<p>On June 28, there was no calendar left before them; the court had to rule.&nbsp; And it did.</p>
<p>CNN and Fox News both reported &ldquo;The individual mandate is unconstitutional.&rdquo;&nbsp; They forgot to mention: &ldquo;under the commerce clause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Twitterdom celebrated, I watched the live blog on SCOTUSblog.com.&nbsp; While others reported the mandate dead, SCOTUSblog posted: &ldquo;The individual mandate survives as a tax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even after I tweeted this news, hundreds of tweets in my stream continued to celebrate the greatly exaggerated death of the individual mandate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those poor bastards,&rdquo; I thought.</p>
<p>One by one, the word got out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Holy crap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To me, the shining city on a hill went dark.</p>
<p>Then I went about my work, ignoring the news for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>At 6:30 pm, I left the office.&nbsp; I changed clothes in my car on the way to Forest Park.</p>
<p>Depression has a way of churning up weird sediment from the bottom of the mind.&nbsp; Sweating the 107-degree sun and driving east on I-44, the inside of my car grew dark from the shadow of the I-270 overpass. I saw Ronald Reagan in bed, white sheets over him, his face contorted in agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the rest of me?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>The remainder of the movie, Kings Row, played out in my mind.</p>
<p>I was looking for words to say at the rally, and I found them.</p>
<p>My mood lifted.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity emerges from depression, as it turns out.&nbsp; And so does perseverance</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Successful writers are like prizefighters who keep on getting hit but won&rsquo;t go down,&rdquo; says Nancy Andreasen, a researcher at University of Iowa. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll stick with it until it&rsquo;s right. And that seems to be what the mood disorders help with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lehrer, Jonah (2012-03-19). Imagine: How Creativity Works (p. 79). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s true of writers and fighters is true of patriots in the battlefield, of crusaders for&nbsp; justice, and of champions of a cause. The fight is never easy.&nbsp; Depression sucks.&nbsp; Agony hurts.&nbsp; Pain is not happiness, no matter how the Ministry of Truth might spin it.</p>
<p>But the pain also compels action. And pain tells you you&rsquo;re still alive.</p>
<blockquote><p>Andreasen says. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re at the cutting edge, then you&rsquo;re going to bleed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lehrer, Jonah (2012-03-19). Imagine: How Creativity Works (p. 79). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t buy my Kings Row happy story, that&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp; You and I will weave in and out of happiness and depression for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the nature of fighting for something bigger than ourseles.&nbsp; Neither of us can get our arms around it alone, and when we corner it, it manages to escape.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t run forever.</p>
<p><strong>If you still feel the pain of loss and hurt and fear, then you&rsquo;re still alive</strong>. You still have fight in you.&nbsp; And you and me and millions of others fighting for liberty should scare the crap out of Barack Obama.</p>
