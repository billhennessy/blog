<p>We throw around big scary words like &ldquo;tyranny&rdquo; too much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m guilty myself.&nbsp; While we get a lot of attention with hyperbole, we&rsquo;ll lose credibility over time.&nbsp; Then when tyranny emerges, people will ignore our screams.</p>
<p>Like now.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/woman-pointing-gun-021.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;margin:0 10px 0 0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="Woman Pointing Gun 02" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/woman-pointing-gun-02_thumb.jpg" alt="Woman Pointing Gun 02" width="328" height="484" align="left" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For years, Congress has used the tax code to motivate behavior.&nbsp; Tax credits for insulated windows and electric cars are examples.&nbsp; The home mortgage deduction is another. And tuition tax credits, dependent tax credits, etc.&nbsp; These tax policies are designed to motivate behavior that the government considers valuable.</p>
<p>Psychologists call this practice positive feedback.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s considered an advanced, intelligent way to influence behavior.&nbsp; Everyone who&rsquo;s raised a child since Piaget and Skinner put down their pens knows that we&rsquo;re supposed to reward and celebrate behaviors we like and ignore behaviors we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Barack Obama and the Democrats have returned to official administrative punishment, and that should scare the hell out of everyone. </strong></p>
<p>The onerous penalty tax in Obamacare&mdash;identified and endorsed by the US Supreme Court&mdash;reversed 70 years of behavioral psychology.&nbsp; Obama thinks of you as children.&nbsp; Bad children in need of a spanking. Do as he says, or you&rsquo;ll be punished.</p>
<p><strong>When governments move from inducements for desired behavior to punishments for undesired, they move from benevolent to malevolent</strong>.&nbsp; (Look it up.) Every dictator of the 20th century garnered support with inducements and solidified power with punishment and terror.</p>
<p>Buy health insurance, or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Buy a new GM, or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Paint your house purple, or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>We can now say we live in a malevolent tyranny, established in 2009 by Barack Obama.</p>
