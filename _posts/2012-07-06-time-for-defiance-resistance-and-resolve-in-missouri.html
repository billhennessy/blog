<p>At the Pachyderm Club&rsquo;s national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609.&#160; &ldquo;It was the best bill I&rsquo;ve ever been involved with,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Those people who just went nuts don&rsquo;t know anything about insurance.&rdquo;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/flag-usa-state-missouri.gif"><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;" title="flag-usa-state-missouri" border="0" alt="flag-usa-state-missouri" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/flag-usa-state-missouri_thumb.gif" width="500" height="294" /></a></p>
<p>If you read my blog, you&rsquo;re likely one of the &ldquo;those people,&rdquo; the ignorant masses who don&rsquo;t understand the fineries of the legislative process.&#160; You don&rsquo;t appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year. </p>
<p>In 2011, the all-Republican Missouri legislature tried to give Obamacare a head start by creating a &ldquo;mandated&rdquo; health insurance exchange. Some popular Republican legislators were horrified that conservatives opposed the bill.&#160; <a href="http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2011/07/25/missouri-scraps-show-me-health-insurance-exchange-act" target="_blank">A handful of courageous state senators, led by Jane Cunningham,&#160; blocked the legislation</a>. </p>
<p>Now that John Roberts has blessed Obamacare, Missouri legislators will show renewed interest in creating the exchanges.&#160; Supporters of the exchanges will talk about the &ldquo;mandate.&rdquo; They will say &ldquo;law of the land&rdquo; and &ldquo;getting the best deal possible&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rsquo;re looking our for Missourians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They can blow out their gavels.</p>
<p>Any Republican who <em>believes</em> in federalism, who <em>believes</em> in the 9th and 10th Amendments, who <em>believes</em> the United States retains some sense of the plural, will stand his ground now, here.<strong> This is a hill worth dying on.</strong> </p>
<p>Any Republican who talks about cutting deals is a Republican who can find a new state to live in.&#160; Politicians use the federal government to force upon their state a system rejected overwhelmingly by the people of their state; Statesmen stand and deliver.</p>
<p>Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal will not capitulate:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We're not expanding Medicaid.<strong> We're not implementing the health exchange</strong>. Instead we're going to do everything we can to elect Mitt Romney to repeal this bad law and replace it," he told Fox News. [emphasis added]</p>

<p><strong>That&rsquo;s the defiance we want from Missouri Republicans.</strong>&#160; We want to see some spine in the House.&#160; We want to see more of the courage we see in Jim Lembke, Brian Nieves, Brad Lager, Jason Crowell, Will Kraus, and Jane Cunningham.&#160; (I apologize if I missed any State Senators who consistently fight for liberty and state sovereignty when there&rsquo;s &ldquo;better deals&rdquo; to be made for themselves.)</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s at stake is not a business deal&mdash;it&rsquo;s about the existence of this republic</strong>.&#160; To reduce the issue of state sovereignty to a question of dollars and sense or &ldquo;best deals&rdquo; is to profane our divine inheritance.&#160; Some of us refuse to squander our God-given liberty.&#160; We won&rsquo;t cut deals. Our state office holders either rise to the occasion and join this fight for Missouri, or <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/07/01/john-roberts-switched-his-vote-under-outside-pressure/" target="_blank">they will share John Roberts&rsquo;s eternal shame</a>. </p>
<p>The days of playing parlor games are over. <strong> It&rsquo;s time for defiance, resistance, and resolve</strong>.&#160; </p>
