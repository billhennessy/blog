<p>If you believe that 92 percent of people need to have most aspect of their lives managed by experts, then a second Obama term will make you happy.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/planetoftheapesending.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="planetoftheapesending" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/planetoftheapesending_thumb.jpg" alt="planetoftheapesending" width="499" height="365" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>If, however, you believe in <a class="zem_slink" title="Self-governance" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">self-governance</a>, that people are endowed by God and nature with the capacity and unalienable right to manage their own affairs, then a second Obama term will be a massive <a class="zem_slink" title="Human rights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">human rights violation</a>.</p>
<p>Consider what the Obama administration has already brought us:</p>
<ul>
<li>He has appointed bureaucrats to make your medical decisions</li>
<li>He has given himself the sole authority to strike down laws passed by Congress</li>
<li>He has taken upon himself the authority to create laws that Congress specifically refused to pass</li>
<li>He has deployed drones to spy on Americans without a warrant</li>
<li>He has denied private companies the permission to seek and recover fuel</li>
<li>He has encouraged violence against the hardest working Americans</li>
<li>He has encouraged illegal aliens to steal our things</li>
<li>He has disparaged the Constitution as &ldquo;fundamental flawed document&rdquo;</li>
<li>He has seized control of private companies</li>
<li>He has damaged America&rsquo;s credit rating</li>
<li>He has exploited racial tension for his own advantage</li>
<li>He has undermined small business</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how bad would a second Obama term be?&nbsp; Frankly, I think it would end the United States of America has we know it.</p>
