<p>Ronald Reagan loved to tell jokes about the Soviet Union.<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/07/16/just-how-bad-would-a-second-obama-term-be"> If Obama&rsquo;s re-elected</a>, though, these same jokes could be turned on the United States.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ronald-reagan.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="Ronald-Reagan" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ronald-reagan_thumb.jpg" alt="Ronald-Reagan" width="393" height="352" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Some of them already can be.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's hard to get an automobile in the United States. They are owned mainly by elite bureaucrats. It takes an average of 10 years to get a car. 1 out of 7 families owned automobiles. You have to go through a major process and put the money out in advance. So this man did this and the dealer said "okay in 10 years come get your car." "Morning or afternoon?" The man replied. "Well what difference does it make?" Said the dealer. "The plumber is coming in the morning."</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an old Castro joke updated.</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama was making a speech to a large assembly. Someone out in the crowd said, "peanuts popcorn cracker jack." This happened about 4 times. So Obama gets annoyed and says, the next man who says that gets deported to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The entire crowd stands up and yells, "POPCORN! PEANUTS! CRACKER JACK!"</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama said in 2008, &ldquo;Whatever we once were, we are no longer a Christian nation.&rdquo; Which reminded me of another of Reagan&rsquo;s old Soviet joke:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Commissar came to the collective farms to see how the harvest was doing and asked a farmer and the farmer said "Oh comrade commissar! If we took all the potatoes, they would reach the foot of God." "Comrade farmer, this is the United States. There is no God." "That's okay, there are no potatoes."</p></blockquote>
<p>With 111 days until the election, here&rsquo;s the saddest joke of all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two Americans were walking down the street, one asked the other, "Have we really achieved full communism?" The other said "oh no. Things are about to get worse."</p></blockquote>
<p>How will you answer your grandchild&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;Tell me what you were doing when they took away our freedom?&rdquo; If you'd like help answering, come to The After Party at Yacovelli's in Florissant, MO, at 7 p.m. Thursday, July 19.</p>
