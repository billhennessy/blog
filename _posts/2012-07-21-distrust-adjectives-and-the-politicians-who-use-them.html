<p>Missouri's primary is August 7. Missouri's Republicans now litter the airwaves and in-boxes with smears against their Republican opponents. What strikes me is the weakness of so many of their pitches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every political ad is a pitch. It's a chance to sell an idea and to volunteer as that idea's champion in some high office. What a noble calling.</p>
<p>Few politicians take that noble path, sadly. Instead, they bully and vilify their opponents--especially their primary opponents. &nbsp;Anyone paying casual attention to Missouri's Republican race for Lieutenant Governor could reach only one conclusion: the two worst human beings on the planet are the two leading GOP candidates.</p>
<p>The campaigns sling mud like it's an Olympic event, but their proxies are even worse. &nbsp;The Missouri GOP and its network of consultants have stitched together a patchwork of bloggers and broadcasters who seem to have a simple mission: if our guy loses, may the Democrat win.</p>
<p>Opposing this establishment juggernaut is an alliance of amateur activists who imitate the pros, sometimes achieving new levels of vitriol. &nbsp;Most of these people on all sides of the crossfire are friends of mine. &nbsp;If not friends, they're fellow believers in smaller government constrained by a written Constitution whose intents were settled upon ratification and are no longer open to&nbsp;imaginative&nbsp;judicial rewriting.</p>
<p>So, how to choose a candidate? &nbsp;Well, like everything of value, it takes a little work.</p>
<p>Hemingway said he was taught to "distrust adjectives." &nbsp;He was taught well. Politicians use adjectives, not to inform, but to tell you how to feel. &nbsp;"Strong conservative," tells you how to feel, not the ideology of the candidate.</p>
<p>But your feelings are your own. Why would you give another person permission to screw with your feelings?</p>
<p>Pay attention to ads. &nbsp;Ignore the half-truths about "my opponent." &nbsp;Count the adjectives that attempt to dictate your feelings. &nbsp;Vote for the candidate who respects you enough not to tell you how you should feel about him or his opponent.</p>
<p>If a candidate wants to manipulate your feelings, he'll happily manipulate your wallet.</p>
