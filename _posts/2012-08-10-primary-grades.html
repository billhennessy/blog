<p>I was surprised to learn that <a class="zem_slink" title="Sarah Steelman" href="http://sarahsteelman.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Sarah Steelman</a> conceded the <a class="zem_slink" title="Republican Party (United States)" href="http://www.gop.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">GOP</a> Senate race at 10:00. I'd talked to <a class="zem_slink" title="Todd Akin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Todd Akin</a> at my polling place on Tuesday morning, and he confirmed my suspicion the <a class="zem_slink" title="Missouri" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.5,-92.5&amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;q=38.5,-92.5 (Missouri)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Missouri</a> Republican race for US Senate would be close. It really wasn't.</p>
<p>Mr. Akin won handily, considering the 3-way race. John Brunner's remarkably negative, nasty, angry campaign should have made the race much closer. It didn't. <a class="zem_slink" title="Sarah Palin Gaffes" href="http://www.break.com/topics/sarah-palin-gaffes" rel="break" target="_blank">Sarah Palin</a>'s endorsement of Ms. Steelman probably helped her, but not enough.</p>

<p>In the end, Missouri Republicans recognized <a href="http://www.akin.org/" target="_blank">Todd Akin's consistent conservatism and rare decency. </a>(Todd Akin is one of the nicest and most honorable people you will ever meet.) Even though I was surprised--and even though Sarah Steelman impressed me throughout the campaign--I believe Missouri made the right choice. Todd Akin was the was the most conservative, viable candidate. I'm glad I voted for him.</p>
<p>I'm also glad <a href="http://peterkinder.com/" target="_blank">I voted for Peter Kinder</a>. Lieutenant Governor Kinder and his chief opponent <a class="zem_slink" title="Brad Lager" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Lager" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Brad Lager</a> ran disappointing campaigns. Both candidates attacked the other with half-truths and ridiculous stretches. Still, Lt. Governor Kinder is a loyal and faithful supporter of St. Louis Tea Party and many other great causes. I like both men, but personal loyalties matter.</p>
<p>I've met Cole McNary a few times, and I thoroughly enjoy talking to him. Cole's bright and cheerful and dedicated to public service. We need more people like that in politics, and <a href="http://colemcnary.com/">Cole will make a great Treasurer</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite vote of August 7 was for <a href="http://edmartinformissouri.com/" target="_blank">Missouri's next Attorney General: Ed Martin</a>. Ed will make a fantastic Attorney General as the battle lines between the states and the government in Washington become more important. If you need to get involved in a race, jump in with Ed. You'll thank yourself later.</p>
<p>I was heartbroken to learn that Lee Presser lost his bid for Republican committeeman for Queeny Township. Lee would have made a difference in the county Republican party. Maybe the victor will, too, but I know Lee would have. Perhaps God has greater plans for Mr. Presser. I hope so.</p>
<p>If you didn't vote on August 7, you have about 90 more chances to make a difference. Put up a yard sign, put some stickers on your bumper, join a lit drop, knock doors, make calls, tell friends, tweet, facebook, blog, comment. Every word of support for a candidate helps. Don't underestimate the power of your voice.</p>
