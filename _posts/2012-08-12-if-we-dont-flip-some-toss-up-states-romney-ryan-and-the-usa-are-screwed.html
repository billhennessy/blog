<p>Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the election&mdash;even if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things.&nbsp; That was necessary.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:large;">SCROLL DOWN FOR TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK</span></strong></p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t enough to win the election and unseat America&rsquo;s first anti-American president.&nbsp; To do that, we must find a way to win over the selfish middle. (I know, writing things like &ldquo;selfish middle&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t help, but I hate lying to them.)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the reality: the Electoral College, which once favored Republicans, is now the exclusive property of the DNC.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because &ldquo;moderates,&rdquo; who vote for candidates promising to give them stuff, have moved into formerly conservative states.&nbsp; In the map above, Obama needs only 33 electoral votes to win.</p>
<p>Now, take out all the toss-ups by giving the gray states to the candidate currently with the lead in polls in that state:</p>

<p>If the election were held today, America would be screwed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, perhaps likely, that <strong>Romney could win a sizable popular majority and STILL lose an Electoral landslide</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we need to do if we don&rsquo;t want to be the generation that lost America:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shore up Romney&rsquo;s lead in the red states like Missouri</li>
<li>Sweep statewide races in red states like Missouri</li>
<li>Ensure a Republican Congress (both houses)</li>
<li>Adopt a toss-up state to work</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are the toss-up states (electoral votes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Colorado (9)</li>
<li>Florida (29)</li>
<li>Iowa (6)</li>
<li>Nevada (6)</li>
<li>New Hampshire (4)</li>
<li>North Carolina (15)</li>
<li>Ohio (18)</li>
<li>Virginia (13)</li>
<li>Wisconsin (10)</li>
</ul>
<p>By &ldquo;adopting,&rdquo; here's what I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose only ONE state to adopt so you can focus your energy</li>
<li>Lobby friends and relatives who live in the state</li>
<li>Donate to state candidates in your adopted states hoping they have coattails</li>
<li>Comment on newspapers and blogs that focus on your adopted state, even if not directly political</li>
<li>Call radio talk shows in your adopted state, using their internet broadcast to listen in</li>
<li>Pray</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite honestly, the Electoral College is stacked heavily against Romney. That means it&rsquo;s stacked against America&rsquo;s future, as well.&nbsp; A landslide for Romney in Missouri won&rsquo;t help Romney in Florida or Virginia.</p>
<p>Yet we still need to elect <a href="http://edmartinformissouri.com/" target="_blank">Ed Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.akin.org" target="_blank">Todd Akin</a>, <a href="http://www.shaneschoeller.org/" target="_blank">Shane Scholler</a>, <a href="http://colemcnary.com/" target="_blank">Cole McNary</a>, <a href="http://peterkinder.com/" target="_blank">Peter Kinder</a> and the other Missouri candidates.&nbsp; We need to elect a solid House delegation. And we need to prevail on statewide and regional referenda.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot to do.&nbsp; And only about 90 days to do it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:large;">TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK</span></strong></p>
<p>You can get involved beginning this <strong>Wednesday, August 4, at 4:00 p.m. in Valley Park at the Victory Bus Tour Rally</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; All statewide and local candidates will be at the Victory Fieldhouse.&nbsp; They will making a stop on the Victory Bus Tour and with this being the statewide HQ, it needs to be full!&nbsp; <strong>Please forward this on to everyone you can</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Victory Bus Tour Rally &ndash; ALL Statewide and Local Candidates</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday August 15<sup>th </sup>&ndash; 3:45 &ndash; 5 pm<br />
Victory Fieldhouse<br />
932A Meramec Station Rd<br />
Fenton, MO 63088</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to discuss this further, come out to <strong>Sky Music Lounge this Thursday, August 16, at 7:00 pm, for the next St. Louis Tea Party After Party</strong>. The scheduled topic is Voter Fraud, but we&rsquo;ll be talking a lot of election strategy, too.</p>
<p>Finally, I need say this:&nbsp; in 2012, yelling at people, telling them they&rsquo;re wrong, won&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; Sitting the election out because your favorite candidate didn&rsquo;t win would be like surrendering to the Soviets.&nbsp; Your children and grandchildren deserve to live as free men and women.&nbsp; If we lose freedom now, it won&rsquo;t come back in their lifetimes.&nbsp; Winning this election might not keep you from the chains of slavery to government, but losing will weld the shackles shut.</p>
