<p>America is suffocating under an amazing tax burden, but most Americans STILL underestimate how much their tax bill really is.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because Washington has done a fantastic job of forcing employers to hide most of the taxes you pay.&nbsp; If people had to see and deal with their total liability, the Democratic Party would be swept into the dust bin of history.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/august_2012/americans_dramatically_underestimate_cost_of_employer_payroll_taxes" target="_blank">Here are some frightening facts from Rasmussen</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 54% of Americans are aware that employers pay payroll taxes on their behalf</li>
<li>Of those who do understand this, on 18% grossly underestimate the dollar amount of the taxes their bosses pay on their behalf</li>
<li>Only 10% of Americans have a basic understanding of the tax burden placed on their employer on their behalf</li>
</ul>
<p>I heard a caller to <a class="zem_slink" title="Rush Limbaugh" href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Rush Limbaugh</a> a few weeks ago.&nbsp; He was a painting contractor who&rsquo;d been in business for 20 years.&nbsp; He is shutting down his company. The combination of a horrible economy and the burdens of even more taxes on business, the added regulation under Obama&rsquo;s administration, the burden of an onerous Obamacare tax avalanche, have combined to make it almost impossible to run a small business&mdash;unless that business services the government.</p>
