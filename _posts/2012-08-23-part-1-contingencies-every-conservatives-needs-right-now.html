<p><em>Part 1 of 3 | <a title="Part 2: Here Is Todd Akin&rsquo;s Real&nbsp;Crime" href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/08/23/part-2-here-is-todd-akins-real-crime/">Read Part 2</a> | <a title="Part 3:  Todd Akin Needs to Lead or Get Out of the&nbsp;Way" href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/08/23/part-3-todd-akin-needs-to-lead-or-get-out-of-the-way/">Read Part 3</a></em></p>
<p>I think it's smart to have a plan in case Todd Akin drops. <strong>The GOP central committee is working on a plan.</strong> If you wait until after a vacancy occurs, your preferences will be meaningless.</p>
<p>That said, if you should decide to plot a contingency to influence the selection of a candidate to fill a vacancy that might occur, consider this:&nbsp; <strong>the MOGOP central committee is not tea-party-ish. They will a choose a candidate the Republican way:&nbsp; </strong><strong>"Whose turn is it?"&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We can dig our heels in and demand the perfect tea-party-ish libertarian-conservative with a perfect a National Right to Life Committee score--and be ignored.&nbsp; Or we can promote someone who a) can win&nbsp; and b) won't drive large factions to launch a write-in campaign or sit out this crucial election cycle.</p>
<p>My suggestion of a contingency, made after personal reflection, some standard game theory strategy, conversations with trusted friends, and gin, was posted about 2 a.m. Tuesday:&nbsp; Wagner to Senate, Jim Lembke to MO-02.&nbsp; <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/08/20/preserving-the-republic-is-paramount-in-2012/">But that's just my opinion</a>, and it assumed that Akin would leave the campaign before 5 p.m Tuesday.</p>
<p>Akin didn't drop by the deadline.&nbsp; His dropping now or later might make my contingency moot.&nbsp; And judicial approval for Akin to drop might not be automatic.&nbsp; (It goes against the system in place, which is the primary system.&nbsp; Akin has done nothing to make his resignation a compelling state interest, only a Republican party interest.)&nbsp; Would Ann Wanger (or Tom Schweich, or JoAnn Emerson or any other substitute) have time to organize a campaign starting next week?&nbsp; And how would the scramble to replace Akin affect RNC convention coverage.&nbsp; (My guess is that coverage would be about abortion, rape, and the crazy Republicans who believe in neither<strong>.) There are now 76 days to the election--and a typical senate race takes two years, not two months.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The best case scenario as of now might be that Akin stay in the race and that he make himself the best possible candidate.&nbsp; About which more in my next missive.</p>
<p>But I'll say it again: <strong> if we want to have an influence on the candidate, we might want to voice our opinions now</strong>, and in a forum where Lloyd Smith and the other central committee members, consultants, and office holders can hear.</p>
