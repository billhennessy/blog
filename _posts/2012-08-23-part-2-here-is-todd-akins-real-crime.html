<p>What is Todd's real crime?</p>
<p><strong>He's a damaged candidate, sure, but he is not a damaged man</strong>.</p>
<p>He was wrong, but<strong> he erred on the side of life</strong>.</p>
<p>It says something about a society and political mood where a man can be disqualified for loving life and God, but another man celebrated for enabling the slaughter of living children with surgical scissors through the base of their skulls.</p>
<p>No, Todd Akin isn't perfect, nor perfectly informed.&nbsp; Neither are the 100 Senators seated. The last candidate sold to us as perfect is the son of a bitch occupying the White House right now.</p>
<p><strong>Did I want Todd to drop?</strong>&nbsp; Yes. But my wish wasn't for some high political or moral reasons; it was the easiest result for me.&nbsp; It was convenient for me.&nbsp; It was the default, selfish choice for me.&nbsp; For me, for Romney, for Marco Rubio, for the GOP, Todd Akin's candidacy is an inconvenient pregnancy we're all too willing to surrender to the political abortionist's vacuum.</p>
<p>Yes, Todd Akin was wrong.&nbsp; Scientifically and rhetorically wrong.&nbsp; He erred on the side of life.&nbsp; He loves life to a flaw, and he's not ashamed to say it out loud.</p>
<p><strong>If that's the <em>worst </em>candidate for Senate we can produce, then the republic is in fine shape</strong>.</p>
