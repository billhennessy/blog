<p><em>Part 3 of 3 | &nbsp;<a title="Part 1: Contingencies Every Conservatives Needs Right&nbsp;Now" href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/08/23/part-1-contingencies-every-conservatives-needs-right-now/">Read Part 1</a> | &nbsp;<a title="Part 2: Here Is Todd Akin&rsquo;s Real&nbsp;Crime" href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/08/23/part-2-here-is-todd-akins-real-crime/">Read Part 2</a></em></p>
<p>Before we get too far down the Akin rally road, let's get some solid advice to Mr. Akin.</p>
<p>His principles, his spine, his grassroots do no good if Missouri turns blue.&nbsp; He cannot advance his causes from his house in Wildwood.&nbsp; Failure to take the Senate makes Obamacare permanent, at least in our lives.</p>
<p>Todd Akin, wonderful man he is, has a lot of responsibility.&nbsp; As a candidate, he needs to grow and fast. Particularly following news that <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_senate_elections/missouri/election_2012_missouri_senate">he trails Claire McCaskill by 10 percentage points according to Rasmussen</a>.</p>
<p>He hasn't helped himself in the aftermath. He has no message except "I'm sorry."&nbsp; He is letting the RNC drive the narrative.&nbsp; He's blaming the "liberal media," but that institution seems happy to let the GOP tear him apart.</p>
<p>If he's content to spend his last half million and then next 10 days apologizing, then he might as well quit now.</p>
<p>Here's what he has to do:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Get out of his bubble and deal with the reality he faces.&nbsp; He's shut himself off from the messages he doesn't want to hear.&nbsp; That's human nature.&nbsp; But to win, he has fight his own inclinations to cocoon.&nbsp; He has to hear from people who love him but think he should drop. He needs to hear from people who hate him but think he should fight on.&nbsp; He needs to hear from <strong>writers, marketers, and artists who know how to hit the brain beneath the prefrontal cortex</strong>.&nbsp; He needs GOOD COUNSEL, not just "amen."</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If he will leave the cocoon he's in, he needs to hear this: <strong>as long as the message is about rape and abortion, he's toast</strong>.&nbsp; If he stays on THIS message and stays in the race, he will lose, most of the Missouri GOP statewide candidates will lose, and MIssouri may go blue. Drop the apology.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <strong>He needs to bring on people he's NOT comfortable with</strong>.&nbsp; People who will challenge.&nbsp; Brilliant strategists and wordsmiths who can craft an argument.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <strong>He needs to know his 3 points for every press interaction and stick to them</strong>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; He needs to <strong>STOP EVANGELIZING and start CONNECTING </strong>with the people who don't already agree with him on everything.&nbsp; They have to agree with him on ONE thing.&nbsp; That's it.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; He needs to memorize this: <strong> "I am pro-life without exception."</strong>&nbsp; That's the end of the pro-life message.&nbsp; Every additional word he utters loses 10,000 votes.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; He needs to memorize this response to every question about abortion:&nbsp; <strong>"Every child conceived should be born into an America that has room for him or her to grow into a loving family, a good home, effective schools, and a lucrative career of their choice." </strong> That's it.&nbsp; Nothing more. It sets up the case of the <strong>economy</strong></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Every answer to every question must get back to the economy and <strong>the economic wreck advanced by Barack Obama with the enthusiastic support of Claire McCaskill.</strong></p>
<p>9.&nbsp; He must PROSECUTE this campaign the way a great general prosecutes a battle. Survival's not enough.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; He must ignore winnability. That's our job. His job is to <strong>make people like him, trust him, vote for him</strong>, or stay home.</p>
<p>Every big name in the GOP has called for him drop out. <strong> Until he leads, the calls will continue</strong>.&nbsp; I know he's shown great spine, but spine is not leadership. If he leads, they will follow.</p>
<p>He can put people on their heels without being a jerk.&nbsp; He has it in him.&nbsp; <strong>Apologizing isn't leadership.</strong>&nbsp; Leaders lead. His rival is Claire McCaskill. She is remarkably unpopular.&nbsp; His nemesis is Barack Obama.&nbsp; He is loathed in Missouri.</p>
<p>Get the message back on track.&nbsp; Be a leader.&nbsp; Win.</p>
<p>There's one question I ask every politician who asks for my support:&nbsp; why do you want this job?&nbsp; The answers reveal tons about the person.&nbsp; Right now, his answer seems to be "because I made a mistake, and I'm sorry."&nbsp; That's weak.&nbsp; It's a loser's answer.</p>
<p>I can't feed him HIS answer.&nbsp; But I can tell him the one's he's got ain't working. <a href="http://blogodidact.blogspot.com/2012/08/taking-about-face-on-todd-akin-without.html">Even among some of his staunchest supporters.</a></p>
