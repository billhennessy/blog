<p>The story Isaac is about tests of faith.</p>
<p>God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, born after Abraham and Sarah had given up hope of conceiving.</p>
<p>Once Isaac was bound and placed on the altar, God stayed Abraham's hand.  "Now I know you fear God."</p>
<p>You know the rest.</p>
<p>It just struck me this morning, listening to the weather during Jamie Allman's show, that Isaac now threatens the GOP convention, dangling above Tampa like Abraham's dagger.</p>
<p>Then there's the Akin matter, half a continent away.</p>
<p>I know the mind sometimes sees patterns where none exists.  But sometimes we're allowed to see patterns that hold the secret to something big.</p>
<p>A lot of us are willing to sacrifice everything to prove our faith--our faith in grassroots, our faith in God, our faith in country.  Steadfastness in the face of danger, rushing toward the gunfire, are qualities we all honor.</p>
<p>I can't help wonder, though, if God is yelling to us and Todd, "Now I know you fear God," and we're not hearing it.</p>
<p>Had Abraham missed God's word, Israel would not have been born.</p>
