<p>Hurricane Isaac smiled on the Republicans in Tampa and delivered more misery to New Orleans and its surroundings.&nbsp; That was just one of the ominous signs that 2012 is shaping up to be a forgettable year for Democrats, especially for Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s <strong>seven more warning signs that Obama&rsquo;s 6-year campaign is about to implode</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Torrential Rains Wipe the Face of Mount Obamamore</strong></p>
<p>Not that weather plays favorites, but you have wonder. First, there was Isaac. It missed Tampa and revealed Obama as a self-serving attention grabber. Obama who's going to New Orleans Monday only as a political necessity after Mitt Romney paid the drenched and ravaged city a visit on Friday.&nbsp; But the real kicker was the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/sep/1/rains-wash-away-mount-obama/" target="_blank">torrential rains that ruined a gigantic Rushmore-like sand sculpture of Dear Leader Obama</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Even Bill Maher Says Clint Eastwood &ldquo;Killed&rdquo; It at GOP Convention</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, John McCain couldn&rsquo;t buy a celebrity endorsement. In 2012, a Hollywood icon delivered one of the best and most bizarre performances in political convention history.&nbsp; Clint Eastwood demonstrated the skills of a great storyteller by talking to an empty chair that represented the empty suit in the White House. <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2012/09/bill-maher-eastwood-killed-it-134038.html" target="_blank">When Bill Maher </a>and Mark Levin agree, it must be true.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Bill Clinton Poised to Upstage Obama (and remind all of us that things were better when Newt was Speaker of the House)</strong></p>
<p>Did I call Obama an attention whore? Well, in that old profession Obama&rsquo;s a cheap streetwalker&nbsp;compared the $10,000-an-hour &ldquo;executive escort&rdquo; named Bill Clinton. And there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence that the two don&rsquo;t like each other. That should make for quite a show as <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/how_clinton_plans_to_upstage_the_2FwMFHFfkOGNT8OfwaFkmO" target="_blank">Bill Clinton brings his Little Rock carnival to North Carolina to show Obama how to turn political tricks like a master</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Democrat Governor Admits We&rsquo;re Not Better Off Than Four Years Ago</strong></p>
<p>The greatest question ever asked in a presidential debate didn&rsquo;t come from the moderator; it came from Ronald Reagan. In a debate with President Jimmy Carter, Reagan asked, &ldquo;Are you better off now than you were four years ago?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer then, as now, was &ldquo;no.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="http://thehill.com/video/campaign/247109-dem-gov-omalley-voters-not-better-off-than-four-years-ago" target="_blank">Even Democrats can&rsquo;t deny</a> that <a href="http://www.peggynoonan.com/article.php?article=576" target="_blank">Obama made it worse</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Democrats Campaign of Personal Attacks Tarnishes the Incumbent</strong></p>
<p>Last June, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/us/politics/obama-campaign-takes-gamble-in-going-negative.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">New York Times realized that Obama&rsquo;s decision to take the low road in 2012 was a big gamble</a>. That&rsquo;s because of neuroscience. When I say something bad about someone, the listener thinks less of my subject, but he&nbsp;also thinks less of me.&nbsp; (I should probably worry more about this fact, huh?)&nbsp; By going negative hard and early, Obama is alienating voters left and right. He&rsquo;s running against America&rsquo;s current state&mdash;a state he produced by his work in the majority party in the Senate and as President.&nbsp; That helps explain why even his own campaign staff can&rsquo;t tell us things are better now than when Obama took office.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; Republican Identification Reaches Historical High</strong></p>
<p>For years, Republican wins were tied&nbsp;to low turnout. That was because far more voters self-identified as Democrat than Republican.&nbsp; But Republican identification is at an all time high following a positive and effective GOP convention.&nbsp; For an incumbent relying on negativity, this Republican surge is a double-barrel shotgun aimed on Obama&rsquo;s political future. He&rsquo;s turning off young voters who should be idealistic, and catalyzing independents to choose the GOP.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/partisan_trends" target="_blank">Rasmussen, 37.6% of us identify as Republican, but only 33.3% as Democrat</a>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s worse for Obama (and better for America) are the trends.&nbsp; Democrat identification is falling as Republican ID rises.&nbsp; In other words, Democrats are becoming Independents and Independents are becoming Republicans.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; Even Huffington Post Realizes Obama Failed to Reform Politics as Promised</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/02/barack-obama-politics_n_1847947.html" target="_blank">Sam Stein at HuffPo&nbsp;writes about an Obama flaw</a> we on the right recognized four years ago: Obama&rsquo;s no reformer.&nbsp;He promised to change politics, to change America, to heal the world and lower the seas.&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; By contrast, <a href="http://freebeacon.com/five-great-lines-from-romneys-speech/" target="_blank">Mitt Romney&rsquo;s determination to help you and your family</a> looks far more promising.</p>
<p>While the Electoral Map is still concerning for Republicans, Obama seems to be steering the Democrats into the teeth of a political hurricane.</p>
