<p>For years voters have complained that politicians and parties say anything to get a vote. People have longed for the days of plain talk and honesty.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/planetoftheapesending.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12276" title="planetoftheapesending.jpg" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/planetoftheapesending.jpg" alt="" width="495" height="361" /></a>Well, the Democrats passed a new platform today. Two headlines emerged:</p>
<p>1. The Democrats rejected any reference to God.</p>
<p>2. The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</p>
<p>The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?</p>
<p>If they're pandering, to whom are the Democrats pandering?</p>
<p>Not to people of faith, of course. &nbsp;And they're not pandering to Israel or to Jews.&nbsp;It seems the Democrats have rejected the blue collar independents. They've rejected the middle class. They've repudiated the American ideal. They've walked away from Western Civilization.</p>
<p>The only conclusion a rational mind can reach is that the Democrats have endorsed the Third World. And they've endorsed it, not as a focus for our charity to raise it up. The Democrats view the Third World as the STANDARD to which America and Western Civilization must be lowered.</p>
<p>The answer to my question is "Yes!" &nbsp;Yes, we can trust Barack Obama and his Democratic party in their rejection of God and Israel.</p>
