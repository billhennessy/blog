<p>As if reading from a script written by the Romney campaign, the <strong>Democrats on Wednesday managed to mangle their public image even further, this time by booing God and Israel.</strong></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_12536" align="aligncenter" width="288"]<a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/reagan-nation-under-god-or-gone-under.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-12536 " title="reagan nation under god or gone under" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/reagan-nation-under-god-or-gone-under.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="288" /></a> Clipped from http://thespeechatimeforchoosing.wordpress.com[/caption]</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Democratic National Convention stripped God's name from their platform and rejected Israel's choice of Jerusalem as its capital.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the party panicked and rushed in an amendment to restore God and Jerusalem. But the delegates wanted none of it.</p>
<p>Here's the damning video (h/t <a href="http://tammybruce.com/2012/09/watch-democrats-boo-as-god-jerusalem-are-put-back-in-party-platform.html" target="_blank">Tammy Bruce</a>).<br />

<p>The story is that Obama himself, freaked out that America noticed God's absence, asked that someone put the traditional language back into the platform.</p>
<p><strong>But the convening Democrats don't want God or Jerusalem in their platform</strong>. They clearly voted down the amendment.&nbsp; Not once, but three times!</p>
<p>After the Democrats denied God three times before the cock crew, the chairman took a page from John Boehner's playbook and imagined that heard a two-thirds vote in the affirmative.</p>
<p>After the chairman ramroded the amendment through, <a href="http://thespeechatimeforchoosing.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/unreal-democrats-boo-inclusion-of-god-jerusalem-in-dnc-platform/" target="_blank">the Democrats booed and hissed</a>!&nbsp; <strong>The Democrats booed God and hissed Israel on live television.</strong></p>
<p>Hey, maybe poor ticket sales wasn't the reason the Dems&nbsp;moved Obama's speech from a 70,000 seat stadium to a 20,000 seat auditorium.&nbsp; They could be afraid of lightning.</p>
