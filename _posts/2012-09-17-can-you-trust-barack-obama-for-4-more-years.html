<p>Barack Obama came to office promising to heal the planet (I didn&rsquo;t know it was sick), lower the waters, and end war as we knew it &ldquo;whilst waking on water squirting wine out his ass,&rdquo; to borrow William S. Burroughs&rsquo;s anti-Christian blasphemy in <em>Naked Lunch</em>. (Funny. I don&rsquo;t recall reading about Christians blowing up embassies over that book&rsquo;s publication.)</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/world-on-fire.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" title="world-on-fire" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/world-on-fire_thumb.jpg" alt="world-on-fire" width="480" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Four years later, The One might want to let the waters rise. Maybe they&rsquo;ll put out the fires in the Middle East.</p>
<p>When Obama took office, the only international hotspots were Afghanistan and Iraq, where allied forces, led by the USA, had Iraq all but tamed. Afghanistan was ready for a surge to bring that conflict into its waning days.</p>
<p>Four years later, The One sees <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-demonstrators-call-for-nuclear-extermination-of-japanese-wild-dogs-2012-9" target="_blank">Chinese demonstrators threatening nuclear annihilation of Japan</a>, Iran warming up its nuclear arsenal, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9545597/Armada-of-British-naval-power-massing-in-the-Gulf-as-Israel-prepares-an-Iran-strike.html" target="_blank">Israel preparing to forcibly demilitarize Iran</a>, and American embassies under deadly attack around the world.</p>
<p>When Obama took office, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/09/14/FLASHBACK-Obama-The-Day-Im-Inaugurated-Muslim-Hostility-Will-Ease" target="_blank">he promised that Muslim hostility would ease</a>.</p>
<p>Four years later, <strong>Muslims around the world feel free to rape and murder ambassadors from the USA</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common mistake made by man in looking forward is believing that the future will be a linear progression of the recent past. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness/dp/081297381X" target="_blank">Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrote a book about this fallacy</a>. So did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Turning-American-Prophecy-Rendezvous/dp/0767900464/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347812564&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+fourth+turning" target="_blank">William Strauss and Neil Howe</a>.</p>
<p><strong>History does not move in a linear progression for long</strong>. Events interrupt the best laid plans.&nbsp; This is why I don&rsquo;t really care much about a candidate&rsquo;s position on&nbsp; issues of the day, except as guideposts to understanding the candidate&rsquo;s world view and mindset. The issues that weigh on an office holder are usually very different from the ones he campaigned on. Instead, I want to know <em>why</em> the candidate takes a position. What&rsquo;s his moral and philosophical reasoning for arriving at a conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>More importantly, we should ask if a candidate has the temperament to deal with crises and the humility to realize that his grand strategy might fall victim to Black Swans. </strong></p>
<p>Barack Obama has proven he lacks the temperament required of the American President. We always knew he was born without humility.</p>
<p>Barack <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/world/middleeast/us-is-preparing-for-a-long-siege-of-arab-unrest.html?_r=1&amp;hp" target="_blank">Obama&rsquo;s presidency has made the world, not just the USA, a worse place to live</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for him to go.</p>
