<p>A genius is someone who can hold contrary concepts simultaneously in mind.</p>
<p>What, then, do we call a person who simultaneously argues two contrary concepts?</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/obama.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="obama" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/obama_thumb.jpg" alt="obama" width="452" height="340" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><strong>How &lsquo;bout &ldquo;demagogue?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Barack Obama told America&rsquo;s business owners that they are not responsible for their success.&nbsp; &ldquo;Someone else built that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, the same Obama told Mitt Romney that there not many people who consider themselves victims.</p>
<p>Does Mr. Obama believe that people in dire straights are not victims of circumstances? It seems so. Obama&rsquo;s telling us that if you succeed, it&rsquo;s because someone else helped you, but if you fail, you fail on your own.</p>
<p>If that is Obama&rsquo;s meaning, then his idea of cradle-to-grave government dependency would be, simply, immoral. You don&rsquo;t systematically reward people who repeatedly fail.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome Mr. Obama to the world of people who believe we are masters of our domains. But we know Mr. Obama is&nbsp;a demagogue, arguing both sides of the same point to secure himself another four years of dictatorial rule.</p>
