<p>I don&rsquo;t get into town to visit my dad often enough. That&rsquo;s my loss.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/jackhennessystlpd.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;float:left;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:0 9px 0 0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="JackHennessySTLPD" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/jackhennessystlpd_thumb.jpg" alt="JackHennessySTLPD" width="199" height="260" align="left" border="0" /></a><strong>Jack Hennessy, my dad, epitomizes what we call The Greatest Generation.</strong></p>
<p>He helped raise his younger brothers and sister after their mother passed away. Jack was ten. His youngest sibling, my uncle Jim, was a newborn.</p>
<p>Jack Hennessy answered the call of <strong>World War II</strong>. He was a Machinist&rsquo;s Mate in the Navy. He answered, again, when <strong>North Korea crossed the 34th Parallel</strong>.</p>
<p>After service in two wars, Jack continued his life of service and protection on the Metropolitan St. Louis Police Department.&nbsp; Later, he retired from Sunnen Products Company in Maplewood.</p>
<p><strong>My dad is one of the wittiest men I&rsquo;ve ever known</strong>. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t always appreciate that wit. Like many&nbsp; young men, I often wondered what all the other people found so funny. When my college buddies started asking if my dad could come out to the bars with us, I began to worry about my friends&rsquo; mental health.</p>
<p>On leave from my own stint in the Navy, though, I began to see what I&rsquo;d been missing. God gave me the great privilege of living the first 21 years of my life in the home of a great man, one who devoted his life to his kids and their happiness. He&rsquo;d served community and country proudly, selflessly, and honorably. He&rsquo;s a devoted grandfather and husband surrounded by loving grandchildren and great-grandchildren, still in St. Louis City where he&rsquo;s lived his whole life.</p>
<p>Today, Jack Hennessy does what he can to service the country and community he loves. He has his yard signs and bumper stickers, and he&rsquo;s itching to vote &ldquo;that bum&rdquo; out of office.</p>
<p>I wish him a very happy birthday, and hope you will to. He doesn&rsquo;t ask for much, but I know something he would love: a big win for Romney, Akin, and, especially, his friend Ed Martin Jr. And your <a href="http://www.24thstate.com/2012/10/vote-no-on-prop-a-this-november-6th.html">No vote on Proposition A</a> wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, either.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Happy Birthday, Dad.</strong></span></h3>
