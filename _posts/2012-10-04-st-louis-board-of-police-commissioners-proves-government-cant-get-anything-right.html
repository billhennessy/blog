<p>Conservatives love cracking on government and its unintended consequences. How often does a government initiative give us backassward results?</p>
<p>Exhibit A: Obama hands Solyndra millions in tax dollars to promote green energy. Solyndra (and numerous other green energy grant recipients) goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>Another example is the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners.</p>
<p>In 1861, <a href="http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/April-2010/Think-Again-Don-039t-Know-Much-About-History/">Missouri&rsquo;s legislature created a board of commissioners to oversee the St. Louis Police Department</a>. Why? Because Missouri was a slave state, but St. Louis was full of Unionists who might use the police to advance the cause of abolition. Missouri&rsquo;s rural politicians created the board to better control that police force.</p>
<p>Over time, of course, that governor-appointed board has given St. Louis and Missouri a great police department. The oversight from Jefferson City limits the amount of corruption on the city&rsquo;s police department.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an irony only government could create. <strong>A board intended to deny basic God-given liberties and rights to slaves became a crucial tool in protecting liberty and rights and fairness and justice in the city of St. Louis for a century and a half. </strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstlouis.cbslocal.com%2F2012%2F09%2F28%2Fnaacp-and-aclu-warn-of-local-control-problems%2F&amp;ei=MFpqUPKaAaTnyAHJroBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOMrNEBUQnTl1G9v2SoWTyH8sAQA&amp;sig2=aSl2vouKRwHw-HQgksiKSA">both the NAACP and the ACLU oppose Proposition A</a>. And, for once in my life,<strong> I agree with the NAACP and the ACLU.&nbsp; Vote No on Proposition A November 6. </strong></p>
