<p>A couple weeks ago, Joe Biden made the news by declaring that the middle class in America has been getting dumped on ever since he and Obama took their oaths of office. The statement marked the first time Biden got something right since that day. What Uncle Joe failed to mention was that he has been in charge of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/vice_president_biden_announces_middle_class_task_force_1">White House&rsquo;s Middle Class Task Force since January 30, 2009</a>.</p>

<p>I clipped the press release from whitehouse.gov in case it gets disappeared before Biden&rsquo;s date with Paul Ryan on Thursday.</p>
<p>This was Joe&rsquo;s charter, straight from the release:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Washington, DC- </em>President Barack Obama today announced the creation of a White House Task Force on Middle Class Working Families to be chaired by Vice President Joe Biden.&nbsp; The Task Force is a major initiative targeted at raising the living standards of middle-class, working families in America.&nbsp; It is comprised of top-level administration policy makers, and in addition to regular meetings, it will conduct outreach sessions with representatives of labor, business, and the advocacy communities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Obama has destroyed the middle class in America, and Joe Biden apparently managed its demise. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303822204577468750027784434.html">Check out this devastating chart from WSJ.com</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303822204577468750027784434.html"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="middleclasswages" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/middleclasswages.jpg" alt="middleclasswages" width="470" height="458" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Why am I surprised? The Obama administration also promised to focus on poverty, and it succeeding in increasing that horrific measure to its highest level since President Johnson launched the War on Poverty. Whatever Obama looks at seems to increase, which tells me he doesn&rsquo;t really look at jobs.</p>
<p>But you can do something about the middle class&rsquo;s decline. <a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/"><strong>Get involved in STLTPC&rsquo;s efforts to get out the vote in 2012</strong></a> for candidates who know how to lead, including <strong>Ed Martin for Attorney General and Todd Akin for US Senate. </strong></p>
