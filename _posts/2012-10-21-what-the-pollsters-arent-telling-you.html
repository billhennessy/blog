<p>Polls do influence elections. That&rsquo;s why people like Nate Silver and some of the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-re-takes-the-lead-in-the-real-clear-politics-2012-10">writers at Business Insider</a> are doing somersaults over Gallup&rsquo;s Daily Presidential Tracking numbers.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/realclearpolitics-2012-election-maps-electoral-map.png"><img title="RealClearPolitics - 2012 Election Maps - Electoral Map" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" border="0" alt="RealClearPolitics - 2012 Election Maps - Electoral Map" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/realclearpolitics-2012-election-maps-electoral-map_thumb.png" width="612" height="482"></a></p>
<p>For over a week, Gallup has shown a tidal wave for support for Mitt Romney. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight tried to discredit Gallup by blogging about outlier results it&rsquo;s shown in past years. Here&rsquo;s the conclusion Business Insider reached:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bottom line: Gallup swings wildly and it frequently has results not in line with other pollsters. <br>Read more: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nate-silver-on-the-gallup-poll-showing-huge-lead-for-mitt-romney-2012-10#ixzz29yPJ4rHE">http://www.businessinsider.com/nate-silver-on-the-gallup-poll-showing-huge-lead-for-mitt-romney-2012-10#ixzz29yPJ4rHE</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what Silver and BI aren&rsquo;t telling you: Romney&rsquo;s 7-point lead in Gallup (52-45 as of October 21) is not a wild swing. Not by a long shot. </p>
<p>Instead, Gallup is showing a consistent move toward Romney ever since the first debate. For example, over the past four days, Romney has led by 6, 7, 6, and 7 points.&nbsp; Before that, he move from 4 points to 6 points over the course of four days.</p>
<p>True, Rasmussen and WSJ/MSLSD show Romney and Obama tied. But that&rsquo;s not enough to toss out Gallup the way Silver and BI attempt.</p>
<p>Now the reason polls matter is because low-information voters tend to break toward the candidate they think will win. If Romney&rsquo;s cavernous 7-point lead holds steady, those late deciders will break for Romney. That could result in a landslide.</p>
<p>Combine all this with the latest RCP Electoral Map showing Romney up by 5 in the electoral vote count, and you can understand why liberals will say anything to discredit the polls.&nbsp; </p>
