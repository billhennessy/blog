<p>The next time some liberal tells you the United States needs to act more like Europe, tell them, &ldquo;no, we believe in science.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/gods.gif"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="gods" alt="gods" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/gods_thumb.gif" height="198" width="292" /></a></p>
<p>Italy sentenced six scientists to prison for the felony of failing to predict an earthquake.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>The people who brought us da Vinci, Columbus, and Marconi believe that those wizards in lab coats with all the machines that go &ldquo;beep&rdquo; are actually gods who control the earth and the stars.</p>
<p>Why not just force scientists to adopt the old Roman gods&rsquo; names: Jupiter, Juno, Neptune, Pluto, Apollo.</p>
<p>Most people with a 5th grade education know that science still cannot predict earthquakes with any degree of accuracy, anymore than Harold Camping could predict the end of the world.</p>
<p>By <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/italian-seismologists-six-years-prison-2012-10">sending six scientists to prison for six years</a>, plus fining them $130,000 each, Italy has likely ended its dalliance with modernity. Who in his right mind would work in a scientific field knowing that any error&mdash;or lack of capability&mdash;will bring on a prison sentence?</p>
<p>I hope our immigration laws will allow entry for great Italian Brain Exodus.</p>
<p>The left in America believes Europe has all the answers. Clearly, Europe believes it has answers that can&rsquo;t be answered. And that&rsquo;s scary in the year 2012.</p>
