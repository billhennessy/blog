<p>The fog of war is lifting from Benghazi, and what lies beneath should shame Obama&rsquo;s most ardent supporters. Barack Obama choked, and Americans died.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/obama_bloodhandshope-80.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="obama_BloodHandsHope-80" alt="obama_BloodHandsHope-80" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/obama_bloodhandshope-80_thumb.jpg" height="204" width="315" /></a></p>
<p>When America came under attack, Obama panicked and froze.</p>
<p>When Americans under his direction pleaded for their lives, he was afraid to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the emerging picture.</p>
<h3>White House Ordered Military and CIA to Stand Down and Let Al Qaeda Kill</h3>
<p>Former Navy SEALs Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, so disgusted by the White House&rsquo;s refusal to help Americans under attack, defied an order to stand down. The heroes died after hours of valiant fighting against overwhelming odds. Woods and Doherty died doing what Barack Obama was politically afraid to order. Ty Woods and Glen Doherty laid down their lives for fellow Americans in violation of cowardly orders from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/14/us/benghazi-victims/index.html">the President of the United States to let Chris Stevens and Sean Smith die</a>.</p>
<p>Two SEALs made the decision to ignore Washington&rsquo;s cowardly order to &ldquo;stand down&rdquo; and let al Qaeda rape and pillage the US Consulate in Benghazi. Ty Woods and Glen Doherty moved in on the attack. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2012/10/26/Father-of-American-Hero-Slain-in-Benghazi-Slams-Obama-Admin-Pack-of-Lies-Murderers">Woods's father&rsquo;s not surprised</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This news that he disobeyed his orders does not surprise me. My son was an American hero. And he was going--he had the moral strength to do what was right. Even if that would professionally cost him his job. Even if it would potentially cost him his life. He was a hero who was willing to do whatever was necessary to respond to their cries for help.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House then leaked the story that Woods died because he disobeyed a direct order. Obama&rsquo;s reasoning for the leak was that Americans would turn against Woods and Doherty for the infraction. But<strong> Obama doesn&rsquo;t know very much about the American mind</strong>.</p>
<p>Americans revere men and women who break the rules to do what&rsquo;s right. We honor as heroes those who will risk career and life to save others, and to save America&rsquo;s honor and prestige. The entire American Revolution was a violation of rules. The Boston Tea Party was a major felony.</p>
<p>When leadership fails, we expect new leaders to emerge. Ty Woods and Glen Doherty emerged as heroes because they violated the unconscionable, cowardly orders of an unfit President.</p>
<h3>White House Ordered the Illegal Arrest of the anti-Mohammed Filmmaker</h3>
<p>Almost immediately after the story broke, the White House invented &ldquo;Muslim Rage&rdquo; over a YouTube video to cover the President&rsquo;s failure. To a degree, it worked. Muslims throughout the Middle East took to the streets to protest in response to Barack Obama&rsquo;s instigation.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be clear about this: <strong>the Muslim rage was fomented by Barack Obama, not by a video</strong>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/2012/dgreenfield/white-house-ordered-prosecution-of-mohammed-filmmaker/">the President had his scapegoat arrested until after the election</a>. According to Front Page Magazine:</p>
<blockquote><p>The father of <a class="zem_slink" title="Tyrone Woods" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Woods" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Tyrone Woods</a>, the ex-Navy SEAL killed in Benghazi, met with Obama and Clinton. And<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/25/Fallen-Seals-Father-Hillary-Told-M-Dont-Worry-Were-Going-To-Arrest-The-Man-That-Did-This?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BreitbartFeed+%28Breitbart+Feed%29"> he reports that Clinton told him </a>that they were going to &ldquo;arrest and prosecute&rdquo; the man behind the Mohammed movie.</p>
<p>There would be no reason for Clinton to have that information unless the decision did not come from the level of the Federal prosecutor in California, thousands of miles away, but from the White House and the State Department. That makes this <strong>a political prosecution and a direct attack by the government on Freedom of Speech by Obama</strong> and Hillary Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>So frightened by his own failure to help dying Americans, Barack Obama took to the last refuge of a dictator, rounding up political prisoners to serve as scapegoats. Mark Basseley Youssef, the filmmaker, is Barack Obama&rsquo;s Alfred Drefus.</p>
<h3>White House and Leon Panetta Lied</h3>
<p>Leon Panetta told reporters that the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/26/panetta-military-lacked-enough-information-to-intervene-during-benghazi-attack/" target="_blank">US military lacked the means and intelligence</a> to intervene during the Benghazi attack.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/obama-375873-video-one.html">He lied</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We also learned that, in those first moments of the attack, <strong>a request for military back-up was made by U.S. staff on the ground but was denied by Washington. </strong>It had planes and Special Forces less than 500 miles away in southern Italy &ndash; or about the same distance as Washington to Boston. They could have been there in less than two hours. Yet <strong>the commander-in-chief declined to give the order</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barack Obama let Americans die because he wanted to be re-elected.</p>
<h3>White House Attempts to Blame Cowardly Orders on CIA. Petreaus Turns on Obama</h3>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s White House story was that the CIA ordered Ty Woods and his security crew to stand down and let Chris Stevens die. Obama expected CIA chief, David Petreaus, to be a good German soldier and back-up the lie.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/petraeus-throws-obama-under-bus_657896.html">Petreaus refused to accept the White House smear.</a> In a statement, Petreaus refuted Obama, saying, &ldquo;No one at any level in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need; claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Obama will fire Petreaus, of course, and replace him with some incompetent but loyal apparatchik. Undoubtedly, Obama&rsquo;s Ministry of Propaganda will leak lies about some hideous flaw in Petreaus&rsquo;s character. That&rsquo;s what dictators do.</p>
<h3>Americans Must Right These Wrongs</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/obama-375873-video-one.html">The people of the United States must right five wrongs</a>. (Six if you count electing Barack Obama in the first place.)</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Obama failed to protect Americans sent into harms way.</p>
<p>2. Obama failed to respond to pleas from Americans under attack when he had the means to do so.</p>
<p>3. Obama jailed a man for his political beliefs.</p>
<p>4. Obama lied to cover up his deadly failures.</p>
<p>5. Obama attempted to smear the true heroes of this affair.</p>
<p>When the President fails, his board of directors fails, too. And we are the President&rsquo;s board.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our job to right this wrong, and just voting him out of office is not enough. The Romney Administration and the next Congress must expose Obama&rsquo;s anti-American.</p>
<p>This is now our failure to fix. We failed as free citizens by electing Barack Obama and a compliant Congress in 2008. If we re-elect Obama, we will miss our opportunity for redemption.</p>
<p>Vote for Romney. Vote Republican.</p>
