<p>Ed Martin's opponent doesn't seem to realize that the job of Missouri's Attorney General is to represent our state. The AG isn't just some high-ranking prosecutor. We have many fine prosecutors protecting us in almost every jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Yes, the Attorney General's office gets involved in state prosecutions. <strong>&nbsp;But the Attorney General also protects Missouri from Washington overreach.</strong></p>
<p>Well, the AG is supposed to protect Missouri's interest. &nbsp;We've been without protection against federal meddling for years. <strong>That's the key distinction between our current Attorney General and Ed Martin.</strong> Chris Koster Super Cop has not lifted a finger to protect you, your family, your business, or your future from Washington politicians. Ed Martin will.</p>
<p>Get protection. <strong>Vote for Ed Martin for Attorney General on November 6</strong>. &nbsp;Your liberty depends on it.</p>
