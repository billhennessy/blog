<p>You have a choice. You can drive that change, or you can be swallowed by it.</p>
<p>In a free society, people have liberty to do <strong>anything</strong> except a few prohibited things.</p>
<p>In a totalitarian society, people have liberty to do <strong>nothing</strong> except a few permitted things.</p>
<p>In a free society, the people have a black list of things they must not do, and government has a white of a few things it may do.</p>
<p>In Barack Obama&rsquo;s America, the government has the black list and the people live by a short white list.</p>
<p>You have a choice. You can live in a society where a few things are prohibited but everything else is up to you. Or you can live in a society where you must get permission to do anything.</p>
<p>Yes, the choice is that stark. It's up to you whether your society is free or controlled.</p>
<p>And voting is not enough. If you want a free society, you must bring others like you to the polls.</p>
<p>We can help you do that.</p>
<p>Saturday, Sunday, and Monday St. Louis Tea Party&rsquo;s Liberty HQ is open all day. We can provide everything you need to sustain the free society, including a walk list&mdash;paper or smartphone&mdash;so you can call out others to vote for freedom with you.</p>
<p>Come to 9966 Lin Ferry Dr, St. Louis, MO 63123, at Lindbergh and Tesson Ferry, to control your destiny.</p>
<p>You are not alone. But you will be if you don&rsquo;t act.</p>
