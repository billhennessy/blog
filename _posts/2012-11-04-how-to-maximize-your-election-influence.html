<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Here's What To Do Today And On Election Day</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Tuesday is the most important election of your life, but voting is never enough. You can have a bigger impact by using social proof to increase your influence. I'll tell you how, and it won't take you long.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/110412_1827_howtomaximi1.jpg" /><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">First, though, make sure nothing gets in the way of exercising your duty to vote.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Studies have shown that <a href="http://www.onlinecandidate.com/articles/simple-question-increase-voter-turnout">you are more likely to vote if you answer these questions</a> before Election Day:<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Do you see yourself fulfilling your duty to vote? (Answer "Yes." Write it down.)<br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">What time do you plan to vote? (Write it down.)<br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Where will you be coming from? (Work, home, etc. Write it down.)<br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">What will you be doing immediately before you go to vote? (A meeting at work? Dropping the kids off at day care? Write it down.)<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Have a friend who might not vote? Ask him these four questions, and he's more likely than not to show up at the polls. But don't ask these questions of friends if you don't know they'll vote right.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Immediately After Voting</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Voting empowers you with remarkable influence and credibility. You'll waste that power, though, if you don't put it to work. Here's what you need to do immediately after voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">For each candidate or issue you support, tweet: "I just voted for [candidate] for [office]. [hashtag] #stltpc #election2012"<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">I just voted for @MittRomney for President. #POTUS #stltpc #election2012</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">I just voted for @EdMartin4Mo for Attorney General. #MOAG #stltpc #election2012<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">I just voted No on Prop A. #PropANo #stltpc #election2012<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Next, repeat the process on Facebook in a single post, but omit the hashtags. Studies show that twitter-style hashtags turn off Facebook users, making them less likely to Like, share, or comment.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Tell People You Voted</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Finally, tell 3 people you voted and for whom. Check this out:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">Even when we control for alternative sources of similar behavior, such as having the same income, education, ideology, or level of political interest, <strong>the typical subject is about 15 percent more likely to vote if one of his discussion partners votes </strong>[emphasis added]<strong>.<br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12pt;">You've just maximized the power of voting. Your influence will spread to at least 3 degrees of separation reaching hundreds or hundreds of thousands of people, depending on how connected your network is. </span></p>
