<p>Barack Obama ridiculed George W. Bush for Katrina. </p>

<p>As people starve and beg for water in Rockaways, Obama&rsquo;s promises to create heaven on earth through government look foolish and born of ignorance. </p>
<p>Obama believes that government can solve any problem, large or small. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/11/02/FEMA-Still-Doesn-t-Have-Bottled-Water-to-Distribute-Finally-Places-Large-Order-Today-for-Delivery-Monday">But his FEMA can&rsquo;t get water to people in New York City</a>. </p>
<p>With election two days away, remember this, you Obama voters: <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/nov/3/obama-gets-briefing-storm-recovery/">the most activist president of all time was unable to feed, clothe, and house hurricane victims despite having a week of warning</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.presstv.ir/usdetail/270139.html">Government has its limits</a>, but it will never limit its own thirst for power. You have to do that. And if you don&rsquo;t put down the monster at the ballot box, it will put you down in a pine box.</p>
