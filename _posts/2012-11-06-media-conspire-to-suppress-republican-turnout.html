<p>St. Louis's KSDK.com is doing its fair share to suppress the Republican voter turnout. They're pumping a handful of counted votes to give the impression that Obama is walking away with the national popular vote:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ksdk.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12762" title="KSDK" alt="" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ksdk.png" height="336" width="470" /></a>Here's the scam. Only 42 votes have been counted in a country of 150 million registered voters. In other words, it's crap. No responsible news organization would post such misleading nonsense--except in hopes of discouraging Romney voters.</p>
<p><strong>Filth.</strong></p>
<p>But that doesn't stop the voter-suppression wizards at KSDK , the AP, and Politico from splattering a meaningless graph across their home pages.</p>
<p>(Note: Politico has since removed the misleading graphic.)</p>
<p>Let KSDK know you don't appreciate voter suppression tactics.</p>

<p>UPDATE: In response to @Michelle_Moore's watchdog journalism, the vote suppressors have update their misleading graphic.</p>
