<p><strong>**UPDATE** Union Declares Victory As<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/11/16/breaking-hostess-shutting-down-for-good-after-labor-clash/" target="_blank"> Hostess Goes Out of Business</a>.&nbsp; No more Ho Hos. **</strong></p>
<p>Unions destroy themselves like pathetic drunks, dragging down everyone around them.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hostess-strike-raw.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="Out Of Work" alt="Out Of Work" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hostess-strike-raw_thumb.jpg" height="228" width="404" /></a></p>
<p>In a fine example of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/11/12/dont-expect-boehner-to-play-the-black-knight/" target="_blank">anti-strategic thinking and un-game theory</a>, the Bakers Union put 637 of its members out of work yesterday.</p>
<p>Hostess&mdash;makers of Twinkies&mdash;is bankrupt. Part of the bankruptcy involved rewriting union contracts to allow the company to stay in business.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of taking one for the team and helping their company crawl out of its fiscal hole, the Bakers went on strike.</strong> Here&rsquo;s one of the geniuses in his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're fighting for our pensions, we're fighting for health care, we're fighting for our wages, we're fighting for our way of life, (Source: <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20121113_Hostess_closings_to_cut_627_jobs.html#ixzz2C9gCPSar" target="_blank">Philly.com</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>So sayeth Barry Fields, president and business manager of Local 6.</p>
<p><strong>So your &ldquo;way of life&rdquo; is unemployment?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The strike forced Hostess to shut down bakeries in St. Louis, Seattle, and Cincinnati, adding 365 St. Louis bakers to the <strong>burgeoning unemployment rosters</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet Barry the union business manger isn&rsquo;t losing his job, is he? He gets to go into work tomorrow and collect his paycheck like every other day&mdash;<strong>a paycheck funded by the very men and women the union bosses just dumped in the street.</strong></p>
<p>Teamsters accepted Hostess&rsquo;s renegotiated contract. The Teamsters apparently want their jobs. I guess the Bakers would rather live off the fat of their neighbors.</p>
<p>The corrupt union bosses now are screaming foul, of course. They say it&rsquo;s not their fault that 637 of their rank and file are unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>Horseshit!</strong></p>
<p>Look at union membership in the the United States in the past 30 years.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2010/01/majority-of-union-members-now-work-for-the-government" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s fallen in half!&nbsp; From 23% in 1980 to 12.4% today</a>. The union is disappearing, union wages are falling.&nbsp; Workers are leaving unions for the same reason that families leave drunks.</p>
<p>You know, these union bosses just re-elected Barack Obama. Maybe they figured Uncle Barry (the President, not the union business manager) will support their cast-offs now. Give them some of that cradle-to-grave government love Obama voters want.</p>
<p><strong>The Hostess layoffs are just one of 14 US layoffs announced today</strong>&mdash;one week after Obama&rsquo;s election to a second term. Here&rsquo;s the whole list, complements of <a href="http://www.dailyjobcuts.com/" target="_blank">DailJobCuts.com</a>:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s 3,901 people (at least) tossed out today alone.</p>

<p>Congratulation, unions. You&rsquo;ve made America the place where unemployment is better than a good union job.</p>
