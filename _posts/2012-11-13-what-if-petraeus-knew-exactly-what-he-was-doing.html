<h6>Note:&nbsp; This is a flight of fantasy. If anything in this post is later shown to conform reality, it&rsquo;s pure coincidence.&nbsp; Nor am I accusing Gen. Petraeus of any crime or of compromising of national security secrets. (Just enjoy it, will ya?)</h6>
<p>A sex scandal rocks the king of spies.</p>
<p>An email chain unravels the Pentagon high command.</p>
<p>A cover-up exposed.</p>
<p>It's like the back cover of a Nelson DeMille novel.</p>
<p>Generals don&rsquo;t forget they&rsquo;re soldiers just because they crawl behind a desk.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/david-petraeus-paula-broadwell-plane.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="david-petraeus-paula-broadwell-plane" alt="david-petraeus-paula-broadwell-plane" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/david-petraeus-paula-broadwell-plane_thumb.jpg" height="304" width="404" /></a></p>
<p>Soldiers look out for each other.</p>
<p>General David Petrraeus&rsquo;s nature is to have the back of every American in uniform. And every American assigned to some shit-hole consulate representing the USA.</p>
<p><strong>When people under a general&rsquo;s command die, the general dies a little with them</strong>. Maybe that&rsquo;s why a fender-bender killed Patton at the end of WWII. He&rsquo;d already absorbed a lot of blows by proxy.</p>
<p><strong>So imagine David Petraeus&rsquo;s fury at the Obama Administration&rsquo;s handling of the Benghazi massacre</strong>. Good men left to die while the President raised money for his re-election.</p>
<p>Then the President&rsquo;s people go on TV to blame to the CIA for the debacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The f***ing gall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As pressure mounts from non-MSM journalists, and the White House continues to lie and stonewall, General Petraeus has had it. On October 26, <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/petraeus-throws-obama-under-bus_657896.html" target="_blank">Petraeus throws Obama under the bus</a> by flatly contradicting Obama&rsquo;s claim that the CIA gave the order to stand down in Benghazi.</p>
<p><em>Repercussions?</em>&nbsp; he thinks. <em>Who cares. The Commander in Chief failed in his most basic duty, and the press is letting&nbsp; him walk.</em></p>
<p>The media and Congressional Democrats didn&rsquo;t give a damn about a few lives in Benghazi.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s no way to get their attention on the matter. Even if Petraeus quit and shouted &ldquo;cover-up&rdquo; from the highest mountain, Brian Williams&rsquo;s head is too far up Obama&rsquo;s ass to hear a pound of C4 detonating 5 feet away.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/paula-broadwell.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="paula-broadwell" alt="paula-broadwell" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/paula-broadwell_thumb.jpg" height="243" width="363" /></a></p>
<h3>And then comes the lady trouble.</h3>
<p>Petraeus is smart enough to know that sex sells newspapers. And TV ads. Wrap a national security story inside a torrid affair with a ex-military hottie and a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=9&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CGoQFjAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2012%2F11%2F13%2Fpetraeus-jill-kelley-broadwell-allen%2F1703097%2F&amp;ei=kfmiUKPHKISgyAHjvoGgDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnHowj9cQI00m0T6-SvcSa3EXhCA&amp;sig2=5_1AWmYLfG20hun3tw8bxA" target="_blank">Tampa Troop Groupie</a> and everybody suddenly knows everything about everything.</p>

<p>He knows that he and West Point graduate Paula Broadwell are going down at some point. Why not take the White House down with them?</p>
<p>So the general makes sure the mistress knows just enough about the Benghazi fiasco to rock the White House, but not enough to compromise sources, methods, or operations.</p>
<p>(There <em>IS</em> a new James Bond movie out, ya know.)</p>
<p>Tonight the FBI raided Broadwell&rsquo;s house. They&rsquo;re confiscating papers and computers&mdash;anything with a magnetic disk or SSD. They&rsquo;re looking for classified information that Paula shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Fox News reports that on October 26&mdash;the same day Patraeus contradicted the White House about Benghazi&mdash;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/11/12/petraeus-mistress-may-have-revealed-classified-information-at-denver-speech/" target="_blank">Paula Broadwell may have included classified information about the attack in a speech in Colorado</a>.</p>
<p>The White House, eager to destroy Petraeus, will leak all the nasty spy stuff they find on the little lady&rsquo;s hard drives. Andrea Mitchell will breathlessly read the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; memos about that horrible night in September. Americans who through "Ben Ghazi" was a kid they sat begin in second grade, will learn all about the #7HoursOfHell.</p>
<p>(Did you know that <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2012/11/13/abc-petraeus-conducted-investigation-in-benghazi-after-attack/" target="_blank">Petraeus conducted his own investigation of Benghazi </a>last month?)</p>
<h3>Could It Be?</h3>
<p>Could David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell have thrown themselves on a grenade to get the word out about Benghazi?</p>
<p>Regardless, Patraeus is ruined. But if this case ended as a complicated act of defiance over Benghazi, this affair could be his finest hour.</p>
<p>After all,<strong> they&rsquo;re reporting on Benghazi now, aren't they?</strong></p>
