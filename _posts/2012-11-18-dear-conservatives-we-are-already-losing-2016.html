<p>If you need to blame someone for our election losses, blame me.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/blame-me.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="blame-me" alt="blame-me" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/blame-me_thumb.jpg" height="240" width="240" /></a></p>
<h3>I Let You Down</h3>
<p>I could have done more. I could have spoken up sooner. I could have been more honest with you about the mistakes we made and the opportunities we ignored. I could have worked harder on what I saw as the most important work we could do.</p>
<p>I let you down. I focused on petty issues of the day, too, instead of working on a different future.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s Time To Look Ahead</h3>
<p>But it&rsquo;s Sunday morning. Obama&rsquo;s been re-elected. The debt is growing as fast as ever. People lose personal power every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to stop blaming bogeymen for the 2012 election and start building a coalition for victory in 2014 and 2016.</p>
<h3>Young Voters Matter</h3>
<p>Between 2008 and 2012, 9.8 million Americans died. The vast majority were over 65, voted in every major election, and voted Republican over 60 percent of the time.</p>
<p>They were replaced by 16.8 million young people who reached voting age. These new <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?s=Millennials&amp;submit=Search" target="_blank">Millennials</a> are much less likely to register and vote, but the ones who do cast votes for Republicans less than 40 percent of the time.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/11/07/the-conservative-base-is-dying-and-taking-freedom-with-it/" target="_blank">If we do nothing between now and the next presidential election, six million Republican voters will die and 7.2 million kids will become Democrats.</a>&nbsp; The next election will be over long before November 8, 2016.</p>
<h3>We Have Hope</h3>
<p>Several surveys late in 2012 found that younger Millennials&mdash;between 17 and 21 years old&mdash;are far more fiscally conservative than old Millennials. On social issues, especially same-sex marriage, they remain liberal.</p>
<p>As young workers struggle to find meaningful jobs, as their debt burden continues to swell, as the world becomes more dangerous, expect this trend to continue.</p>
<p>If we are serous about restoring the balance of power away from central authorities and toward the people, we have to stop fighting the last election and start helping young adults.</p>
<h3>Here&rsquo;s What You Can Do Now</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write more about this over the next week, but here are four things you can do right now to help win future elections.</p>
<p><strong>Stop</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blaming the election on vote fraud</li>
<li>Talking about social issues unless they obviously tie to economic issues</li>
<li>Hanging around in conservative echo chambers</li>
<li>Talking about secession, nullification, and disrupting the Electoral College vote</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Start</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping young people find jobs</li>
<li>Treating young adults like adults</li>
<li>Explaining the virtues of being free to choose</li>
<li>Subtly explaining the failure of planned economies</li>
</ul>
<p>That may not seem like much, but it is. Especially the Stops. If we don&rsquo;t stop turning off potential allies, we&rsquo;ll continue to lose election after election.</p>
<h3>Build On These 4 Pillars</h3>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we change what we believe. It means we advance the ideas that don&rsquo;t turn people off. We have many such ideas like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong economy</li>
<li>A smaller government</li>
<li>A safer world</li>
<li>A sustainable immigration policy</li>
</ul>
<p>We can build Big Ideas from these four pillars. We can take on the other problems later.</p>
<p>Please check back here tomorrow to find out how our passions are making us sound ridiculous.</p>
