<p>I wrote yesterday that <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/11/18/dear-conservatives-we-are-already-losing-2016/" target="_blank">if you need someone to blame, blame me. Don&rsquo;t blame bogeymen</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/reality-check.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="reality-check" alt="reality-check" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/reality-check_thumb.jpg" height="682" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Yes, vote fraud is real</strong>. Voter rolls in most states need to be cleaned up. Voter intimidation should be harshly prosecuted.</p>
<p>You can sign up at <a href="http://www.truethevote.org" target="_blank">True the Vote</a> or <a href="http://www.moprecinctproject.org/" target="_blank">Missouri Precinct Project</a> to take effective, useful action. These organizations do vital work, and they both need more volunteers.</p>
<p>Using vote fraud, however, as an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/11/secession-petitions-gain-clicks-fast/" target="_blank">excuse for secession</a> or for <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/obama-birthplace-controversy/2012/11/new-strategy-to-stop-the-usurper-urgent-call-to-action-the-house-of-representatives-can-choose-our-next-president-so-if-13-of-the-states-17-do-not-cast-their-electoral-college-votes-then-it-2449480.html" target="_blank">blocking the Electoral College vote</a> is neither effective nor useful. In fact, it makes us sound like the idiots the left wants us to be.</p>
<p>Please knock it off.</p>
<h3>Try Critical Thinking Instead of Knee-Jerk Emotions</h3>
<p>I read a piece American Thinker that made me want to jump out a window. <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/11/was_the_2012_election_stolen.html#ixzz2CbAkXjbu" target="_blank">Selwyn Duke tries making the case that Romney lost because of voter fraud</a>.</p>
<p>His case is weak.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t bother with his points about anecdotal evidence, since they&rsquo;re anecdotal. They can&rsquo;t be proven one way or the other.</p>
<p>Instead, I looked at the numbers.</p>
<h4>Romney Got No Votes In Some Philadelphia Divisions</h4>
<p>True, this is odd. It may will be that Romney votes were thrown out. But there are two problems with blaming Pennsylvania&rsquo;s outcome on this anomaly.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re talking about a predominantly or exclusively Democrat area. Had Obama received less than 98 percent of the vote, something would have been wrong. So we&rsquo;re talking about, at most,&nbsp; a 2 percent problem in a small area.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The total vote in these Philly division was less than 20,000 votes. Suppose that 2 percent intended to vote for Romney. That&rsquo;s 400 votes. It doesn&rsquo;t change the results. It doesn&rsquo;t even come close.</p>
<h4>Military Overseas Ballot Requests Way Down</h4>
<p>Duke also cites a drop in <em>requests </em>for absentee ballots by armed forces serving over seas. He points a report that in <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/01/military-ballot-requests-down-in-key-battleground-states/" target="_blank">Virginia and Ohio, requests for military absentee ballots were down by 70 percent</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="height:114px;width:249px;"><p>Frankly, it is inconceivable that military interest in voting could've dropped so drastically given conservatives' passion this election season.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several problems with Duke&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<ol>
<li>Over 83,000 troops came home. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdFRFYjhsS1hyT0txMzlnV0Y0S2hqQ2c#gid=0" target="_blank">Thirty percent fewer troops are serving overseas</a>in 2012 compared to 2008. And a LOT of them are stationed in Virginia.</li>
<li>The drop in requests was for the entire election cycle, not just the November 8 election. Obama was unopposed in the primaries.</li>
<li>The drop is in <em>requests</em>.&nbsp; The DoD can&rsquo;t make people request an absentee ballot. (I was the Voting Rights Officer on USS Woodrow Wilson&mdash;it&rsquo;s not always easy to get people to vote.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I agree that the DoD did a poor job getting ballots to troops. But the problems were with ballots that had already been requested.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s wait to see&nbsp; how many military ballots were cast before we lose our heads.</p>
<h3>Secession and Disrupting the Electoral College Doesn&rsquo;t Help Conservatism</h3>
<p>If you believe the election was stolen, I get why you want to take extreme measures.&nbsp; But your extreme measures don&rsquo;t win any hearts and minds. They make us look nuts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redstate.com/2012/11/13/is-it-time-to-roll-up-the-welcome-mat-here/" target="_blank">Read Erick Erickson&rsquo;s blog about rolling up the welcome mat at RedState.</a> Clearly, I&rsquo;m not the only one noticing the crazy talk around here.</p>
<p>Our mission is to win-over people who want what we want:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong economy</li>
<li>A smaller, fiscally responsible government</li>
<li>A safer world</li>
<li>A sustainable immigration policy</li>
</ul>
<p>These are things that almost everyone in America can agree on&mdash;everyone except the far left nuts.</p>
<p>Reagan attracted big numbers with 3 of those 4 pillars. Immigration wasn&rsquo;t as big a deal then, because our population still had some organic growth going on.</p>
<p><strong>Companies and nations fall when they refuse to face the realities of their situations</strong>. The conservative movement is supposed to be the embodiment of hard, cold looks at the national condition. Let&rsquo;s keep it that way, okay?</p>
