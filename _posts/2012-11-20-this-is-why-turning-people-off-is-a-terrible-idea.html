<p>Sometimes a cause&rsquo;s worst enemies are its best friends.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/strategy-button.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="Untitled-1" alt="Untitled-1" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/strategy-button_thumb.jpg" height="346" width="347" /></a></p>
<p>In 1995, 56 percent of American described themselves as &ldquo;pro-choice.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the time, Michael Kinsley on CNN&rsquo;s Crossfire declared the debate over.</p>
<p>Then something strange happened. Americans started changing their minds.&nbsp; The pro-life movement whittled away at public opinion.</p>
<p>By May of this year, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/154838/pro-choice-americans-record-low.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup found &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; to be at an all-time low:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The 41% of Americans who now identify themselves as "pro-choice" is down from 47% last July and is one percentage point below the previous record low in Gallup trends, recorded in May 2009. Fifty percent now call themselves "pro-life," one point shy of the record high, also from May 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pro-life-pro-choice-chart.gif"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="pro-life-pro-choice-chart" alt="pro-life-pro-choice-chart" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pro-life-pro-choice-chart_thumb.gif" height="320" width="570" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure someone, somewhere mimicked Kinsley by declaring the debate over again.</p>
<p>Since May, the winds have shifted. In fact, those describing their views on abortion as &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; have returned near their record high at 54%.</p>
<h3>Why this shift?</h3>
<p>Well, it happened just after Todd Akin&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;shut the whole thing down&rdquo; comments in August. While I can&rsquo;t say for sure that Akin&rsquo;s comments triggered the shift, I can&rsquo;t point to any other major abortion news that coincides with the shift.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2012/11/15/rasmussen-54-now-call-themselves-pro-choice-38-pro-life/" target="_blank">Allahpundit points out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]uddenly, in August of this year, the number jumps. Why? Well, what else happened in August this year? Right: Todd Akin opened his yapper about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin_rape_and_pregnancy_comment_controversy">&ldquo;legitimate rape&rdquo;</a> and women&rsquo;s supposed biological defense mechanisms against it and that was the beginning of the end for Republican chances to take back the Senate. How big a deal was it? Weeks later, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin_rape_and_pregnancy_comment_controversy">NYT poll</a> was seeing more support for the idea that abortion should be &ldquo;generally available&rdquo; than it had in over 15 years.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Akin didn&rsquo;t try to sabotage the pro-life movement, of course. He is sincerely and devoutly pro-life. He&rsquo;s so pro-life, in fact, that he&rsquo;s willing to say anything to advance his cause.</p>
<h3>And that&rsquo;s the problem.</h3>
<p>Sometimes our greatest gift to the movement is to shut up or to give strategic answers.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not lying. You tell the truth; you just tell in a way that doesn&rsquo;t turn off the people who don&rsquo;t yet see things exactly the way you do.</p>
<p>Why is this so important? Because if your statement turns people off, you lose your ability to influence minds. And influence, not being &ldquo;right,&rdquo; is the only weapon we have in public debate.</p>
<p>Not only did Akin&rsquo;s ridiculous comment end his political career and hurt chances of flipping control of the Senate, he set back his beloved pro-life movement almost 20 years.</p>
<p>When I <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/11/19/vote-fraud-didnt-cost-romney-the-election/" target="_blank">urge conservatives to think critically and act strategically</a>, it&rsquo;s not squishy; it&rsquo;s the only path to victory.</p>
