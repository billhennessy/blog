<p>Encouraging Boehner to shut down the government is the surest way to end conservatism as a practical political alternative.</p>
<p><strong>The GOP has no leverage</strong> in budget negotiations, and conservative denial won&rsquo;t change that.</p>
<h3>Use Game Theory</h3>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/11/12/dont-expect-boehner-to-play-the-black-knight/" target="_blank">As I wrote on November 12</a>, fighting Obama &ndash; voting down a budget in the House &ndash; results in the GOP&rsquo;s worst possible outcome: total blame for anything that goes wrong and no credit for anything that goes right.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s not an idiot, and neither are the media. That&rsquo;s why Obama proposed tax increases, executive power increases, and spending <em>increases</em> far beyond those previously proposed.</p>
<h3>Obama holds all the cards.</h3>
<p>Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, Charles Krauthammer, Mark Lewis, and Ramesh Ponnuru all see it.</p>
<p><strong>Rush</strong>:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/11/30/what_should_the_republicans_do_rush" target="_blank">Republicans should walk away from negotiations</a></p>
<p><strong>Newt</strong>:&nbsp; <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/29/gingrich-house-republicans-should-stop-negotiating-with-president-obama/" target="_blank">Republicans should stop negotiating</a></p>
<p><strong>The Hammer</strong>: <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/11/29/krauthammer_on_fiscal_cliff_negotiations_republicans_ought_to_simply_walk_away.html" target="_blank">Republicans should simply walk away</a></p>
<p><strong>Lewis</strong>:&nbsp; <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/30/on-the-fiscal-cliff-republicans-are-so-screwed/" target="_blank">Republicans Are So Screwed</a></p>
<p><strong>Ponnuru</strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/334533/deal-or-no-deal-ramesh-ponnuru" target="_blank">No win situation</a></p>
<p>The clich&eacute; &ldquo;elections have consequences&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t gotten through some people&rsquo;s heads. It will.</p>
<p>Expect Obama to get almost everything he demanded.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1.6 Trillion tax hike&mdash;the largest in world history</li>
<li>Vast new powers for the president, including the power to raise the debt ceiling (or end the ceiling)</li>
<li>Big increases in social and construction spending</li>
<li>Effective elimination of the principle that the House originates tax and spend bills</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s over. The Congress is going the way of the Reichstag&mdash;a formalized debate society that endorses the president&rsquo;s dictates.</p>
<p>Fixing a problem requires, first, an honest understanding of the real situation. Passing a Republican budget in the House might make YOU feel good (&ldquo;Yeah! Boehner. Way to stick it to the man!&rdquo;), but it won&rsquo;t change what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Senate blocks</li>
<li>Obama goes on tour of 5 states hurt most by the fiscal cliff</li>
<li>Media runs 24/7 stories on the mounting &ldquo;Republican Body Count&rdquo; of Americans dying because Boehner drove the government train off the fiscal cliff</li>
<li>Panicked Republicans call on Boehner to pass the President&rsquo;s tax cuts</li>
<li>House Republicans cave</li>
<li>Obama has a beer party</li>
<li>Obama&rsquo;s power becomes effectively absolute.</li>
</ul>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what you want, then throw your temper tantrum and enjoy the consequences.</p>
<h3>There Is Only One Option For House Republicans</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the best strategy for Boehner to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk away from the negotiations</li>
<li>Tell the president the House GOP will vote &ldquo;Present&rdquo;</li>
<li>Spend $2 billion over 2 years on marketing, networking, and advertising the dangers of doing what Obama just did</li>
<li>Focus on 2014</li>
</ul>
<p>My solution might suck, but it&rsquo;s what we, the people, voted for.</p>
<p>P.S. If you meet a &ldquo;constitutionalist&rdquo; or &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; who voted 3rd party, thank him for the worst-case scenario playing out before our eyes</p>
