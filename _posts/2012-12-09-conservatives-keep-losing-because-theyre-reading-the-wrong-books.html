<p>For the past four years. conservatives have worried more about being right while liberals worried about winning.</p>
<p>We all know how that worked out.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how right you are if you&rsquo;re powerless</strong>.Right now we are.</p>
<p>Satisfied?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>After four years of 5,000 Leap and Constitution study groups, of Constitutional workshops, and rallies in the park, let&rsquo;s make a vow to ourselves and to each other: <strong>We&rsquo;re Done With Losing.</strong></p>
<p>Here are the books I challenge you to read in the next six months. Hold study groups on these tomes. Get people excited about winning a damn race here and there.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t review. I&rsquo;ll give you the list. Amazon&rsquo;s pretty good about turning shoppers into buyers.</p>

<p>These books are not about the Constitution or the wages of socialism. You already know all you need to know about those things.</p>
<p>These books are about winning. If you don&rsquo;t start winning, it won&rsquo;t matter what you else you know or believe.</p>
<p>P.S. If you object to any of these titles because they&rsquo;re by or about a liberal, you&rsquo;re the problem.</p>
