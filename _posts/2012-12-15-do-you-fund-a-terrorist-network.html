<p>According to the FBI:</p>
<blockquote><p>Domestic terrorism is the unlawful use, or threatened use, of force or violence by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or Puerto Rico without foreign direction committed against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Michigan, union protesters physically assaulted Steven Crowder of Fox News, then destroyed a tent belonging to Americans for Prosperity (video below). </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine:</p>
<p>The union activity caught on tape involved </p>
<ol>
<li>unlawful
<li>violence and/or use of force
<li>by a group
<li>based in the United States
<li>without foreign direction (that we know of)
<li>committed against persons (Crowder) and property (AFP)
<li>to intimidate or coerce the governor of Michigan (government) and members of AFP (civilian population)
<li>in furtherance of political or social objectives </li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, unions &ndash; at least those involved in the Michigan terrorism -- are terrorist organizations. International unions would seem to be international terrorist organizations. </p>
<p>Funding of terrorist organization is a federal crime. Logically, then, anyone who voluntarily contributes to a union willfully and unlawfully supports a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
