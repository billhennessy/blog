<p>Now that Boehner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo; strategy has blown up like a poisoned dog, here&rsquo;s what Boehner will do.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/11/12/dont-expect-boehner-to-play-the-black-knight/">Remember this chart from last month</a>? It shows strategic options from John Boehner&rsquo;s point of view:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/lets-be-honest-about-republican-options-on-the.png"><img title="Let&rsquo;s Be Honest About Republican Options On The" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin-left:auto;border-left:0;display:block;padding-right:0;margin-right:auto;" border="0" alt="Let&rsquo;s Be Honest About Republican Options On The" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/lets-be-honest-about-republican-options-on-the_thumb.png" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, Boehner tried to land about halfway between the top and bottom quadrant on the left, shown here</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fiscal-cliff-plan-b-position.png"><img title="Fiscal Cliff Plan B Position" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin-left:auto;border-left:0;display:block;padding-right:0;margin-right:auto;" border="0" alt="Fiscal Cliff Plan B Position" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fiscal-cliff-plan-b-position_thumb.png" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Now that Plan B has been rejected, Boehner&rsquo;s choices are limited to these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjourn and hit the fiscal cliff</li>
<li>Cut a deal that will earn most Democrat votes and enough Republican votes to pass</li>
</ul>
<p>My guess is that Boehner feels betrayed by the 40 or so Republicans who refused to vote for Plan B. In reality, <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2012/12/05/john-boehner-on-independent-thinking/">he brought it upon himself by purging the committees of fiscal conservatives</a>. (<a href="http://www.redstate.com/2012/12/21/just-how-badly-john-boehner-played-his-hand/">Anyone who thinks some of this isn&rsquo;t payback is deluding himself</a>.)</p>
<p>Further, Boehner knows that if he can&rsquo;t get enough GOP votes to pass an extension of Bush tax cuts on everyone making less than $1 million, he has no chance of getting more Republicans vote for a&nbsp; bigger compromise.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Therefore, the only way the House can pass a fiscal cliff bill is to win a bunch of Democrat votes.&nbsp; Since Democrats know this, they can hold out for whatever Obama demands.&nbsp; Boehner, who doesn&rsquo;t want to get blamed for failing to reach a deal, will go along and he&rsquo;ll bring enough Republicans to pass it. </p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fiscal-cliff-likely-deal.png"><img title="Fiscal Cliff Likely Deal" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin-left:auto;border-left:0;display:block;padding-right:0;margin-right:auto;" border="0" alt="Fiscal Cliff Likely Deal" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fiscal-cliff-likely-deal_thumb.png" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>That means Obama gets pretty much whatever he wants.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my prediction. </p>
<p><strong>Of course, I could be wrong. </strong></p>
<p>Boehner could also reach a deal with 40 or so Democrats by moving the extension down to $400,000 from $1 million.&nbsp; From a purely strategic point of view, Democrats would be foolish to make that deal. It would undermine Obama and give Republicans their second-best outcome.&nbsp; (Remember, by second-best, I&rsquo;m speaking strategically. I&rsquo;m not saying a compromise is the second-best policy outcome.)</p>
<p>With most of the Blue Dog Democrats gone, I don&rsquo;t see Boehner picking up enough Democrat votes. They know they can dictate the terms, and they probably will. </p>
<p>Sure, Boehner could join the conservatives and pass a bill that permanently extends the Bush tax cuts completely.&nbsp; The Senate will ignore it, we&rsquo;ll hit fiscal cliff, and the next Congress will deal with it. This would be the best policy choice, but, in Boehner&rsquo;s mind, it would be the worst possible strategic move.&nbsp; (Again, I&rsquo;m saying Boehner&rsquo;s right, but I think this is how he sees it.) Plus, having been humiliated by conservatives on Plan B, Boehner is unlikely to join them now. </p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2012/12/21/stop-pretending-we-cant-disagree-on-this/">go read Erick Erickson&rsquo;s excellent explanation of <strong>why Boehner&rsquo;s thinking is wrong</strong></a>.&nbsp; (I disagree with only one point of Erick&rsquo;s. He thinks Boehner and the GOP will let us hit the fiscal cliff; I do not, as explained above.) Following Erick&rsquo;s lead, here&rsquo;s the best policy outcome:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fiscal-cliff-best-policy.png"><img title="Fiscal Cliff Best Policy" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin-left:auto;border-left:0;display:block;padding-right:0;margin-right:auto;" border="0" alt="Fiscal Cliff Best Policy" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fiscal-cliff-best-policy_thumb.png" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What do you think Boehner will do? </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Please don&rsquo;t scream at me that I&rsquo;m pulling for a compromise or I want Obama&rsquo;s $1.6 trillion tax hike to pass. If you&rsquo;re tempted to do so, read this entire piece again carefully. </p>
