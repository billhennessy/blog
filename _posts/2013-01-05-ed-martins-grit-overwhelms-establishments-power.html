<p>In a blow to the old guard establishment,<strong> the Missouri Republican State Committee elected Ed Martin Jr. as its new party chairman</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/edmartin2-27.jpg"><img title="EdMartin2-27" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" border="0" alt="Ed Martin Addresses First St. Louis Tea Party 2-27-2009" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/edmartin2-27_thumb.jpg" width="603" height="278"></a></p>
<p>Roy Blunt and all six Republican members of Congress from Missouri lobbied the new state committee over the past few weeks to block Ed and retain the establishment&rsquo;s choice, David Cole. <a href="https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/28741/martin_mogop_chairman_010513?coverpage=2479" target="_blank">Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cole&rsquo;s loss appears to be a setback for Missouri&rsquo;s GOP establishment. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and all six Missouri Republicans in the U.S. House had signed a letter backing Cole&rsquo;s re-election.
<p>Martin&rsquo;s win was seen as a victory for the Missouri GOP&rsquo;s more conservative factions, including some tea party groups &ndash; notably the St. Louis Tea Party, whose founder Bill Hennessy had endorsed Martin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The victory demonstrates the power of grit&mdash;one of Ed Martin&rsquo;s most valuable qualities</strong>. Ed narrowly lost his bid to unseat former Congressman Russ Carnahan in 2010.&nbsp; In that race, Ed came closer than any Republican in recent memory to taking Missouri&rsquo;s old 3rd District away from Democrats. Ed&rsquo;s gritty campaign solidified his standing with grassroots tea partiers. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/what-is-success-true-grit/" target="_blank">Grit is the most important factor in success</a> according to human behavioral scientists. As Jonah Lehrer explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>After analyzing the data, Duckworth discovered the importance of a psychological trait known as grit. In previous papers, Duckworth has demonstrated that grit can be reliably measured with a short survey that measures consistency of passions (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;I have been obsessed with a certain idea or project for a short time but later lost interest&rsquo;&rsquo;) and consistency of effort (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;Setbacks don&rsquo;t discourage me&rsquo;&rsquo;) over time using a 5-point scale. Not surprisingly, those with grit are more single-minded about their goals &ndash; they tend to get obsessed with certain activities &ndash; and also more likely to persist in the face of struggle and failure. Woody Allen famously declared that &ldquo;Eighty percent of success is showing up&rdquo;. Grit is what allows you show up again and again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Ed put in the 10,000 hours of practice.</strong> His dogged campaigns in 2010 and 2012 gave him the courage and earned him the privilege to show up. </p>
<p>After losing his bid to unseat Attorney General Chris Koster last November, a lot people wanted Ed to give up politics. But Ed&rsquo;s no quitter. Instead,<strong> he rallied his considerable charm and tenacity</strong> to take on a role that is well suited to Ed Martin&rsquo;s skill and experience. </p>
<p>Missouri&rsquo;s Democrats and even some conservatives mockingly said &ldquo;Ed&nbsp; finally won an election.&rdquo; The Democrats should be very worried that a talent as gritty and popular as Ed Martin now chairs the Missouri GOP. Conservative might want to review <a href="http://www.wealthforteens.com/teen-personal-growth/abraham-lincoln-didnt-quit/" target="_blank">Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s electoral history</a> before mocking the resilience of a man who never gives up. </p>
<p>Congratulations, also, to Trish Vincent, Auditor Tom Schweich&rsquo;s chief of staff, elected Chairwoman, or co-chair in today&rsquo;s PC-speak. And a special congratulations and thanks to Frieda Keogh of Missouri Precinct Project and a new member of the Republican State Committee. Frieda&rsquo;s efforts to advance grassroots causes and candidates is a gift to Missouri and America. </p>
