<p>Often, the best outcome seems less satisfying than alternatives.

<p>Daniel Kahneman&nbsp; is a psychologist who won a Nobel in economics for Prospect Theory, more commonly called Behavioral Economics. In his book, <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>, Kahneman describes a cognitive bias that leads people to make the wrong choice on automobiles. But the bias might actually keep gasoline consumption high by fooling people with number.
<p>Say you&rsquo;re concerned with the amount of gasoline you use. You have a Ford Focus that gets 30 MPG, and a Hummer that gets 12 MPG. You need a huge SUV, but you want to minimize your environmental footprint.
<p>Do you<br />
<blockquote>
<p>a) trade in your 30 MPG Focus for a Prius that gets 40 MPG, or </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>b) trade in your 12 MPG Hummer for an H3 that gets 14 MPG?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Circle you choice)
<p>Chances are, it feels better to jump up to the 40 MPG Prius. In fact, it looks like a no-brainer. Both the government and environmentalists push us toward 40 MPG choice. But let&rsquo;s do the math.
<p>First, we have to convert miles per gallon to gallons per mile. The formula is simple: 1/MPG. Then, assume we drive each vehicle 10,000 miles a year. Here&rsquo;s how the numbers work out:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hummer</strong>: 1/12 = 0.0833 GPM * 10,000 = 833.33 Gallons per Year<br><strong>H3</strong>: 1/14 = 0.0714 GPM * 10,000 = 714.28 Gallons per Year<br><b>Savings: 119.05 Gallons per Year</b><br></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Focus</strong>: 1/30 = 0.0333 GPM * 10,000 = 333.33 Gallons per Year<br><strong>Prius</strong>: 1/14 = 0.0.25 GPM * 10,000 = 250.00 Gallons per Year<br><b>Savings: 83.33 Gallons per Year</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your goal is to reduce gasoline consumption as much as possible, trade in the Hummer for the H3. But it still won&rsquo;t <i>feel</i> right. Going from a Hummer to a Prius, of course, would be the biggest possible savings of 583 gallons per year, or $1954 at $3.35 per gallon. But people resist drastic changes. You&rsquo;re more likely to entice a Hummer driver to make the switch to brand new H3.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>It might sound counterintuitive, but just because gas prices are high doesn't mean it's the right time to trade in that SUV for a high-mpg vehicle, Wiesenfelder says. When fuel costs are high, the demand and price for efficient vehicles goes up. Conversely, demand for gas-guzzling SUVs goes down, and their trade-in values fall.
<p>"It's a romantic notion to drop your SUV for a Prius, but you've got to do the math," says Wiesenfelder. [<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/high-mpg-car-cheaper-than-a-hybrid-2013-1" target="_blank">source</a>]</p>

<p>Advocates count on people to be lazy and take the obvious choice.&nbsp; As we&rsquo;ve seen here, though, the obvious choice isn&rsquo;t always the best choice. Remember this <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/12/28/how-psychological-biases-make-good-government-unlikely/" target="_blank">whenever you hear the government talk about obvious, no-brainer choices</a>. Chances are, it&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
