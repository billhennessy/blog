  content: Taking ANY Federal money makes you a slave to the national corruption.  If
    you are for taking more Federal funding, you are not a [r]epublican, but a Republican.  The
    State is sovereign, but when you accept money from the Union of States, i.e. the
    United States of America, you then forfeit the right to be free and give then
    the right to control that power.  You lose the greatness of numerated powers,
    and tell the corrupt Centrists in D.C. that it is ok to take control and give
    our people less freedom.  It is despicable and troubling that anyone that calls
    themselves a Republican would ever allow this.  A line must be drawn.

  content: "I assume you're referring to states taking federal funding, not individuals.
    I was in the Navy for a decade and got paid. \r\n\r\nWhen you say \"you are not
    a republican,\" do you mean that in the <a href=\"http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_02.htm#001\"
    target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Montesquieuan sense of republican</a>? If so,
    I'd have to disagree, since a republic, as understood at the time of the founding,
    is simply a public government--either democracy, aristocracy, or oligarchy as
    opposed to a private form of government, such as a monarchy. \r\n\r\nAnd, while
    I agree that we need to increase fidelity to the Constitution, I think that's
    a continuous and long-term process. In the meantime, states have little choice
    but deal with federal funding, and the people who work in those governments should
    be able to do so without feeling like traitors. \r\n\r\nThe measure should be
    whether we're moving closer to Constitutional fidelity every year or further away."

<p>You probably never heard of Lance Beshore of Joplin, MO. He&rsquo;s been Missouri&rsquo;s delegate to the Republican National Committee&rsquo;s Rules Committee for 12 years. He runs the lobbying department of Leggett &amp; Platt furniture company. He&rsquo;s on the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, and he&rsquo;s chairman of the board of Freeman Health Systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hookers1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; display: inline; padding-top: 0; border-width: 0;" title="hookers" alt="hookers" src="http://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hookers_thumb1.jpg" width="383" height="255" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In his roles at Freeman and the Missouri Chamber, <strong>Beshore advocates for Obamacare Medicaid Expansion in Missouri</strong>.</p>
<p>This information, via <a href="http://www.24thstate.com/2013/02/subverting-the-gop-into-medicaid-expansion.html" target="_blank">24th State, may explain why Lance Beshore and Catherine Hanaway reneged on their support of Ed Martin to replace Lance on the GOP rules committee</a>.</p>
<h3>Medicaid Expansion Is The Poison Apple of Republican Politics</h3>
<p>When the Obama administration dangled money before the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/02/dont-let-missouris-businesspeople-become-prostitutes-in-business-suits/" target="_blank">Missouri Chamber&rsquo;s eyes, they lit up like a smack addict in a shooting gallery</a>. Medicaid Expansion is a short-term windfall for hospital owners and long-term fiscal nightmare for taxpayers. (<a href="http://www.unitedformissouri.org/action-alert?id=MjI=#end" target="_blank">Click here to learn what you can do about Medicaid Expansion in Missouri</a>.)</p>
<p>The Obama scheme offers states 100% funding of Medicaid Expansion for 3 years, and phases out the payments over time. Then the state gets stuck with the bill. The federal money comes from young workers by taxing future income to pay the debt on federal money.</p>
<p>Beshore and his Missouri Chamber cronies are trying to transfer wealth from children to their grandparents.&nbsp; Money can corrupt.</p>
<h3>Beshore Changed His Mind, But Why Is Hanaway Going Along</h3>
<p>In January, according to sources, Beshore decided not to seek a fourth term on the GOP rules committee, and Ed Martin was tapped to replace him. Catherine Hanaway, Beshore, and Martin agreed to the change by email and forwarded the agreement to the RNC.&nbsp; I have not seen the email, but I have spoken to two people who have.</p>
<p>The RNC later decided they needed a signed statement from all three. <strong>Beshore refused to sign</strong>. According to friends, Hanaway said she won&rsquo;t kick Beshore off the rules committee, despite the fact that agreed to leave last month.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we stand, with <a href="http://www.news.stlpublicradio.org/post/weeks-politically-speaking-podcast-20" target="_blank">Beshore and Hanaway apparently abandoning the grassroots for the cronies</a>.</p>
<p>Looks like Obama&rsquo;s strategy of turning Republicans into crony capitalists and pitting them against grassroots conservatives is working.</p>
<p>Now go read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422144208/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422144208&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hennesssview-20">Conscious Capitalism: Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business</a><img style="margin: 0; border-style: none!important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1422144208" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> to learn about business people and principles we can admire.</p>
