  content: Everybody read Angelo Codevilla's article in the current issue of Forbes,
    (Feb 20).  He has it pegged, and confirms that Rush is Right; Again!  The GOP
    Hates US!  Both parties are Traitorous Parasites; just different flavors.  We're
    the only Real Americans still standing as Rome is falling, Again.

<p>Every election cycle <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/12/06/this-is-the-infographic-that-the-whole-republican-party-is-freaking-out-about/">millions of reliable Republican voters die</a> and even more millions of Democrat voters get the vote. Messaging and pandering won&rsquo;t fix the problem. Reforming the party might.</p>
<p>Libertarian reforms offer the best hope, because all the other conservative factions &ndash; evangelicals, Second Amendment, home schoolers, fiscal -- have hit their high-water marks. We saw that in 2012. Liberty, however, sells with the kids. Or it might, if Republicans would try it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m losing hope fast.</p>
<p>In the past week, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/23/did-prostitutes-in-business-suits-cost-ed-martin-a-place-on-the-rules-committee/" target="_blank">Catherine Hanaway played Lucy to Ed Martin&rsquo;s Charlie Brown by snatching away the RNC Rules Committee as Ed was about to put it through uprights</a>.</p>
<p>Ed&rsquo;s a big boy and he&rsquo;ll continue to work for a stronger, larger Republican Party. But Hanaway&rsquo;s back-stabbing, bait-and-switch, backroom politics damages the party with its most important block: young libertarian voters.</p>
<h4>The GOP Screws the Ron Paul People Every Chance It Gets</h4>
<p>Back in the early days of the Tea Party movement, our ranks were swelled by the Ron Paul folks. Not all would vote Republican, but groups like <a href="http://www.campaignforliberty.org/" target="_blank">Campaign for Liberty</a> and <a href="http://www.libertyrestorationproject.org/" target="_blank">Liberty Restoration Project</a> gave us energy, organization, and idea&mdash;all qualities lacking in the Republican Party since 1994.</p>
<p>While the libertarians remained wary of the GOP hacks like Hanaway, a new breed of Republican candidates, like Ed Martin, kept many in the fold.</p>
<p>Ed&rsquo;s place on the reviled Republican Rules Committee was a big win for the libertarians, and a shot in the arm to the GOP&rsquo;s future. It was the libertarian wing, after all, that <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2012/08/28/gop-rules-committee-rapidly-moving-to-shut-out-grassroots-at-200-p-m-today/">Beshore and his Rules Committee cronies tried to undermine at the 2012 RNC convention</a>.</p>
<h4>Catherine Hanaway and Lance Beshore Prove The Cynics Right</h4>
<p>Republicans like Hanaway and Beshore make it hard for me to ask young voters to have faith that the GOP will make things better. As <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2013/02/22/the-american-conservative-unions-embarrassing-scorecard/" target="_blank">Erick Erickson pointed out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact is too many conservative groups and Republicans in Congress think the problem in Washington is Democrats in charge of government and not government itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that Republican insiders don&rsquo;t like to hear it, but someone has to tell them: <strong><em>you</em> are ruining this country.</strong> Stop blaming the Democrats and the press. Stop blaming tea party &ldquo;whackos.&rdquo; Look in the mirror and see what we see.</p>
<p>Until you stop trading our futures for your personal political ambitions, <strong>we don&rsquo;t have your backs</strong>. We&rsquo;ll stand by our champions like Ed, instead. And we&rsquo;ll help him pick up the pieces when you&rsquo;re done smashing our country to bits.</p>
