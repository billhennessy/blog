<p>When I was in high school I wanted to be a US Senator.</p>
<p>Wait, that wasn&rsquo;t the punch line.</p>
<p>That ambition changed, and I'm glad it did. It was a bad ambition.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs wanted to build an enduring company that made insanely great products that people loved. Thank God he pursued and achieved his ambition, because it was good and noble.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference? It&rsquo;s not that one ambition was personal and one involved others. Nor is the difference between public and private sector.</p>
<p><strong>What makes ambition good or bad is neither the object nor the subject, but the verb</strong>.</p>
<p>I wanted to <em>be</em> something great. Jobs wanted to <em>do</em>&nbsp; something great. Wanting to be corrupts and limits, while wanting to do strengthens and expands.</p>
<h4>Getting Better Beats Being Good</h4>
<p>Research shows that people perform better when pursuing getting-better goals than when pursing being-good goals. It&rsquo;s wonderfully organized by Heidi Grant Halverson, PhD, in her useful and readable ebook <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00607EX1E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00607EX1E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hennesssview-20">Nine Things Successful People Do Differently</a><img style="margin: 0px; border-style: none !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00607EX1E" width="1" height="1" border="0" />.</p>
<blockquote><p>in one study I conducted a few years ago at Lehigh University with Laura Gelety, we found that people in pursuit of be-good goals (i.e., trying to show how smart they already were) performed very poorly on a test of problem solving when we made the test more difficult (either by interrupting them frequently, or by throwing in a few additional unsolvable problems).</p></blockquote>
<p>But getting-better crowd wasn&rsquo;t deterred.</p>
<blockquote><p>The amazing thing was that the people who were pursuing get-better goals (i.e., who saw the test as an opportunity to learn a new problem-solving skill) were completely unaffected by any of our dirty tricks. No matter how hard we made it, these participants stayed motivated and did well.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The Unbearable State Of Being</h4>
<p>The common factor to both ambition and goal-pursuit seems to be . . . being. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/being.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="being" alt="being" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/being_thumb.jpg" width="190" height="266" align="right" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>When we decide that we want to be something&mdash;rich, thin, happy, Speaker of the House, Emperor of the North&mdash;we set off on a terminal path. God forbid we should achieve that goal young. Orson Welles wrote, directed, produced, and starred in his masterpiece, Citizen Kane, at 26. He wanted to be a great director.</p>
<p><strong>When a person wants to <em>be</em> a Senator, he might accomplish the goal at the expense of everything he might have <em>done.</em></strong> And at the expense of everything he once <em>believed.</em></p>
<p>A person who enters politics to fight corruption and promote liberty wiil behave differently from <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/24/the-republican-party-seems-bent-on-destruction/">one who runs to be governor</a>. The trade-offs of campaign contributions for a vote in the legislature won&rsquo;t tempt the person wants to do great things, but will easily sway the one who wants to be great.</p>
<h4>Pay Attention To Their Verbs</h4>
<p>Listen closely to a person&rsquo;s ambitions. When they tell you want they want to be, ask them what they want to do. If they can&rsquo;t answer that question with the same enthusiasm they showed in <em>being</em>, watch out.</p>
