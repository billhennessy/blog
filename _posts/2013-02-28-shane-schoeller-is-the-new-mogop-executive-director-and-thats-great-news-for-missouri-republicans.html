<p>Shane Schoeller narrowly missed winning the job he and I wish he had: Missouri Secretary of State. Shane lost&mdash;along with every other non-incumbent Republican for a statewide office.</p>

Party Chairman Ed Martin made the announcement on February 28, 2013[/caption]</p>
<p>The good news is that Missouri Republican Chairman, <strong><a href="http://www.mogop.org/2013/02/6797/">Ed Martin, has tapped Shane Schoeller as the party&rsquo;s Executive Director</a>.</strong></p>
<p>There were some fabulous candidates under consideration, which made the selection process difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shane&rsquo;s a good solid conservative and he has connections across the state,&rdquo; Ed Martin told me by phone this morning. I agree.</p>
<p>Those connection will be important after the disastrous 2012 election. Despite success in growing their numbers in the Missouri legislature, Republicans lost every statewide race except Lieutenant Governor.</p>
<p>Ed Martin and Shane have a huge job in front of them, and it won&rsquo;t be easy. The GOP Establishment has shown little interest in seeing them succeed. Meanwhile, the grassroots movement of 2009 and 2010 feels exhausted after keeping an unappreciative GOP alive for four years&mdash;with little help from the party itself.</p>
<p>I wish Shane all the best. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but I&rsquo;m ready to help him succeed.</p>
