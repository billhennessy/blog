<p>A reporter once informed Cary Grant, the legendary leading man, that a Time Magazine poll found him the man most American men wanted to be. Was Grant surprised?</p>
<p>"No," he said. "Everybody wants to be Cary Grant. I want to be Cary Grant."</p>
<h4>Don Draper is the new Cary Grant</h4>
<p>Who doesn't want to be like Don Draper? Great looking. Smart. Rich. Beautiful women. Good dad.</p>
<p>But there's something else that makes Don Draper's character fantastic. It makes him the quintessential American Man of post-war America.</p>
<p>It's not his looks or his money.</p>
<p>It's not his great suits and beautiful women.</p>
<p>It's a quality that a lot of us need right now, and it's lacking--big time.</p>
<p>What makes Draper admirable is <strong>his unflappable confidence in life</strong>.</p>
<h4>"Everything's going to be okay."</h4>
<p>He says it all the time when others around him fall to pieces.</p>
<p>"It's going to be okay, Bets," to Betsy.</p>
<p>"Everything's going to okay," he tells the kids when Kennedy was assassinated.</p>
<p>Even when Betsy told him she wanted a divorce, he called her and calmly told her, "I hope you get everything you ever wanted."</p>
<p>And he meant it.</p>
<p>Don Draper wasn't vindictive or hysterical. He wasn't happy that his family fell apart, but he wasn't going to let it ruin his life. Or theirs.</p>
<h4>"Everything's going to be ok."</h4>
<p>Yes, Don gets divorced. Yes, Sterling-Cooper-Draper-Price loses Lucky Strike. Yes, many bad things happen to Don, and most of them he brings upon himself.</p>
<p>But his attitude gets him through. And he always comes out all the better.</p>
<h4>"How can you possibly know that?"</h4>
<p>Betsy, on the other hand, doesn't expect things to be ok. She expects everything to fall apart. And, for her, it always does.</p>
<p>Bobby's birthday party is a disaster. So is her second marriage. And she gets fat. And her kids don't like her (for good reason). And Don marries a beautiful young woman who's a better mother than Betsy.</p>
<p>If only Betsy had taken Don's advice.</p>
<h4>"Everything's going to be okay."</h4>
<p>The President and the press are playing Betsy Francis. They're telling us that everything's about to go to hell in a handbasket because of the sequester Obama invented. And it's all the Republicans' fault. And the Tea Party's.</p>
<p>Don't listen to them. Listen to Don Draper.</p>
<p>Better yet, do as Don would do. Tell yourself and everyone around you, "Everything is going to be ok."</p>
<p>It will. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/24/why-the-sequester-is-worse-now-than-it-will-be-after-it-happens/">Nothing's ever as bad as you think it will be when you think about it</a>.</p>
