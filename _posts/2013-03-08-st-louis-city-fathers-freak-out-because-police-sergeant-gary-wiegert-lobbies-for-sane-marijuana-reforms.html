  content: "Refirms like this are long over due. \r\n\r\nIs Marijuana worse than Alcohol,
    Heroin, Cocaine, Meth? I dare say it is safer than all of these and it also has
    actual medical benefits too. Look up the way Marijuana was demonized in th epast.
    The Alchol lobby would hate it to be legal.\r\n\r\nTime to decriminalize and prioritize
    law enforcements use of their resources."

  content: I agree with Wiegert, Marijuana is not that bad, i do not smoke it, so
    i am not a crazy "pot head" but i believe in legalization of hemp, as hemp is
    an excellent cash crop that can be made into clothing, and various other materials
    and is " green" as can be, and decriminalization would free a lot of good people,
    the war on drugs has not worked and breaucrats have just been linning their pockets
    with cash for decades now.

  content: "Thanks, Mary.\n\nI know it takes a lot of courage to post write about
    marijuana reform online. It did for me, anyway. But it also took a lot of courage
    for people show up at Tea Party Protests in 2009. \n\nI don't see any difference,
    though. Do we really want to live in fear that the state will punish us for speaking
    our minds? For demanding the we be permitted to own our own lives?  \n\nThe government's
    first duty is to protect citizens from exploitation by powerful agents. When the
    government becomes that powerful agent, we have a right and a duty to reform it."

<p>You'd think people would listen when a career police officer says we need to reform marijuana laws. But n-o-o-o-o. &nbsp;Not in St. Louis, anyway.</p>
<p>Gary Wiegert is a 30+ year police officer who signed up to <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2011/03/27/does-the-tea-party-need-a-lobbyist/">lobby Jefferson City on behalf of tea party</a> issues a couple of years ago. Some people freaked out over that, but Gary was instrumental in advancing tea party issues for the past 2 years.</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/bill-mcclellan/bill-mcclellan-ready-to-roll-a-joint-so-i-can/article_527612ec-e681-5db3-9d66-30d8fbd67e87.html" target="_blank">Wiegert is lobbying for some mild marijuana reforms</a>, and&nbsp;<strong>the Masters of the City are freaking out</strong>.&nbsp; Not the people, mind you, but the people who make money on draconian marijuana laws.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="378"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gary-wiegert.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="gary-wiegert" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gary-wiegert_thumb.jpg" alt="gary-wiegert" width="378" height="211" border="0" /></a> Police veteran Gary Wiegert, who led opposition to Prop A which gave control of the St. Louis Police Board, is a St. Louis Tea Party Coalition activists and a Show-Me Cannabis lobbyist working to reform marijuana laws.[/caption]</p>
<p>Wiegert represents an organization called Show-Me Cannabis in support of two bills currently awaiting hearings in Jefferson City&mdash;<a href="http://legalize.nationalcannabiscoalition.com/page/speakout/support-decriminalization-and-expungement-in-missouri-" target="_blank">HB 512 and HB 511</a>. As I&rsquo;ve written before, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/27/weednesday-post-why-the-gop-needs-to-champion-marijuana-law-reform/" target="_blank">the Republican party should be pushing this issue</a>&mdash;it&rsquo;s <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/01/01/its-time-to-end-war-on-weed/" target="_blank">a matter of liberty and good government</a>.</p>
<p>The laws would decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana and allow those previously convicted to expunge their records, according to Show-Me Cannabis.</p>
<p>HB 512:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would eliminate the possibility of arrest or jail for marijuana and paraphernalia possession. It would also limit the fines for those offenses to $250 and, in most cases, keep the charge from appearing on the defendant's public record through use of a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS).</p></blockquote>
<p>HB 511:</p>
<blockquote><p>would expand the use of expungement. This bill would allow for the expungement of all misdemeanor offenses, including marijuana and paraphernalia cases, in both state and municipal courts, with the exception of violent or sex-related charges. Expungement would be available after five years with no additional similar convictions.</p></blockquote>
<p>These small reforms would let police focus on more serious crimes, save Missouri taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, reduce crime, and strengthen society. And HB 512 mirrors the policy of Columbia, Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>Neither Wiegert nor Show-Me Cannabis nor I advocate breaking the law</strong>, and Gary enforces the laws on the books. He also knows the toll those laws take on law enforcement and budgets, and the damage they do to people&rsquo;s lives. Nor are we advocating use of marijuana, even if it were legal. We realize that any drug can lead to problems for individuals, families, and societies. That's why there are <a href="http://www.drugtreatment.com/topics/choose-a-top-inpatient-marijuana-treatment-rehab/" target="_blank">inpatient treatment options for marijuana addicts</a>.</p>
<p>Fox 2 News&rsquo; <a href="http://fox2now.com/2013/03/08/st-louis-officer-lobbying-to-legalize-marijuana-lands-in-hot-water/" target="_blank">Charles Jaco hoped to interview Wiegert this afternoon</a>, but Gary&rsquo;s bosses in the police department barred Wiegert from talking to the press. Wiegert has a meeting with those bosses on Monday at the police headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>I support Sgt. Wiegert, liberty, and reform of draconian marijuana laws</strong>. I also support Gary&rsquo;s right to advocate for changes to laws he believes are unjust and counterproductive. If he cannot lobby for reform of marijuana laws, I don't expect to see any police chiefs lobbying to weaken the Second Amendment&mdash;or anything else.</p>
