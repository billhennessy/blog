<p>John McCain doesn't want the Republican Party to outlive him.</p>
<p>He's afraid. Afraid that, after he's gone, his political widow will remarry someone younger, sexier, more fun.</p>
<h4>Thursday, March 7, 2013: Senate Office Building, Washington, DC</h4>
<p>In the dark cloisters of his Senate office, McCain leans back in his chair, tie loosened, jacket tossed casually over a guest chair, fingers interlaced behind his white head, and broods.</p>
<p>He sees those rascally young libertarians--the ones who actually want to own their own lives--plunging into the party. "<em>My</em>&nbsp;party, goddammit!"</p>
<p>McCain leans forward, now, elbows on desk, and rubs his face.</p>
<p>"I won't have it. I won't have the love of my life&nbsp;. . . violated by those damn kids. Punks!"</p>
<p>He&nbsp;sips Scotch from a carved crystal rocks glass.</p>
<p>"Rand Paul. Homewrecker!"</p>
<p>Rand Paul's the Senator pushing this union between the young libertarians and Senator McCain's political bride--the GOP.</p>
<p>"Screw them all."</p>
<p>He's up now. Walks around the desk to retrieve his suit jacket. Slides it on. Leans across the wide desk to grab the Scotch and downs it.</p>
<p>"I'll fix this."</p>
<p>He heads out the door to take to the Senate floor and tell the world about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/03/08/mccain-undermines-his-own-cause/" target="_blank">Rand Paul's plot to hook up the Republican Party with those liberty-loving kids who don't respect their elders</a>.</p>
<p>"Liberty my ass," he mutters as he passes a pair of 20-somethings in the hall outside. "I didn't spend&nbsp;five and a half&nbsp;years in a Vietnamese prison camp for . . ."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;Rep. Justin Amash slams McCain to the canvas on twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Sen McCain called @<a href="https://twitter.com/senrandpaul">senrandpaul</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/sentedcruz">sentedcruz</a> &amp; me "wacko birds." Bravo, Senator. You got us. Did you come up with that at <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23DinnerWithBarack">#DinnerWithBarack</a>?</p>
