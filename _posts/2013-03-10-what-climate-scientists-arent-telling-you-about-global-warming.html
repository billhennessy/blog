<p>Allan Savory caused the slaughter of 40,000 elephants in a vain attempt to save the planet by stopping desertification.</p>
<p>It turns out that he succeeded only in turning lush grasslands into desert. And, of course, killing 40,000 elephants.</p>

Instead, the grasslands died even faster. Savory devoted his life to finding out why he and other scientists were so wrong about desertification.[/caption]</p>
<p>Savory loves animals. He grew up in Africa and adores elephants. So why did he kill them?</p>
<h3>Scientists Often Do More Harm Than Good (Iatrogenic)</h3>
<p>Global temperatures are higher now, on average, than they were 100 years ago. I won&rsquo;t deny that. Nor will I deny that human activity has contributed to that warming. It has.</p>
<p>The question is: which human activities contribute to global warming, or AGW (anthropogenic global warming).</p>
<p>Climate scientists like <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2009/06/29/james-hansen-lies-and-defrauds-even-more/">James Hansen labor to hide the truth</a>. But they know.</p>
<p><strong>The answer is shocking. And the solution is delicious.</strong></p>
<p>In this TED talk, biologist Allan Savory explains how he and other scientists discovered that in their vainglorious attempts to improve nature climate scientists and biologists have, instead, nearly destroyed it.</p>

<p>Thankfully,<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/07/why-being-wrong-can-be-the-best-policy/"> Allan Savory had the humility to admit he was wrong </a>and the tenacity to spend his life finding a solution to the problem his fellow scientists caused.</p>
<h4>Desertification Before Dinner?</h4>
<p>One of the biggest culprits is the US Department of the Interior. The United States government has promoted desertification&mdash;turning grasslands and forests into barren desert&mdash;by driving cattle and herds off of government property, believing that animals cause desertification.</p>
<p>But herds of animals that roamed grasslands for eons before man help create and support grasslands. In other words, animals don&rsquo;t kill nature, people do.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_13334" align="alignnone" width="450"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desertification.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-13334 " src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desertification-300x171.jpg" alt="global map of desertification" width="450" height="257" /></a> Areas in brown and yellow are deserts. You can see sand swallowing the planet. Savory's field work shows that introducing herds of plant-eating animals can reverse desertification.[/caption]</p>
<h3>The Solution to Desertification Is What&rsquo;s For Dinner</h3>
<p>The answer is beef.</p>
<p><strong>Savory and his team have reversed desertification over 15 million hectares</strong> by introducing herds of cattle and sheep to deserts.</p>
<p>The process is simple. It works exactly as nature planned&mdash;before pointy-headed scientists decided they knew more about nature than nature.</p>
<h3>Reversing Desertification Feed The Hungry, Too</h3>
<p>In most of the world, only animals can feed the human population. The environment will not support enough plant-based nutrition no matter what you do.</p>
<p>But herds of animals can live off the land, and feed the people.</p>
<p>Savory has proven it.</p>
<h3>Ask Congress To Reintroduce Herds To National Parks</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.savoryinstitute.com/2012/07/allan-savory/u-s-drought-a-man-made-natural-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The US government and its expert scientists caused desertification over millions of acres of the US</a> by forcing cattle and sheep out of national parks. And the same government policies caused the drought plaguing western states today. Savory writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have also found that only two things we do cause billions of acres of such land to exhibit predominantly bare ground between plants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Too few large herbivores (mainly livestock today) on the land demonstrating&nbsp; unnatural behavior in the absence of pack hunting predators. This leads to over-resting the land while overgrazing plants.</li>
<li>Overuse and misuse of the tool of fire</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither droughts nor any other action of nature cause billions of acres of the US and the world&rsquo;s grasslands to exhibit such high amounts of bare soil between plants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put the cows back where they belong.</p>
<p>Ask your US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senators</a> and <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Representatives</a> to watch this video. Send them a link to this blog. Ask them to promote good policy and reduce destruction of grasslands. Then, please tell the world you took action by writing a comment on this post.</p>
<p>Here is the text of my message to Rep. Ann Wagner and Senator Roy Blunt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you know that we can improve the environment and stop desertification of America's grasslands by increasing grazing on national lands?</p>
<p>Please see this blog post and watch the video. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/10/what-climate-scientists-arent-telling-you-about-global-warming">http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/10/what-climate-scientists-arent-telling-you-about-global-warming</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time the Republicans get behind an important environmental cause that will actually make things better. This is good policy and good politics.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a matter of life and death for people and the planet. And it might prevent another 40,000 orphaned baby elephants.</p>
<p>Note: I replaced "climate scientists" with "scientists" in several places. Allan Savory is a biologist, not a climate scientist. He was not concerned with climate when he worked on the project that killed 40,000 elephants.</p>
