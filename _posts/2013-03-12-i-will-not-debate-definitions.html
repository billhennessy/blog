  content: "Lewis Carroll said it best:\r\n\r\n\"My name is Alice, but &mdash; \"\r\n\"It's
    a stupid name enough!\" Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently. \"What does it
    mean?\"\r\n\"Must a name mean something?\" Alice asked doubtfully.\r\n\"Of course
    it must,\" Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: \"my name means the shape I
    am &mdash; and a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name like yours, you might
    be any shape, almost.\"\r\n\"When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather
    a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean &mdash; neither more
    nor less.\"\r\n\"The question is,\" said Alice, \"whether you can make words mean
    so many different things.\"\r\n\"The question is,\" said Humpty Dumpty, \"which
    is to be master&mdash; that's all.\""

  content: You are riight Bill.  Republicans spend too much time debating each other
    rather than focusing on how to win elections.  Democrats don't have to worry about
    destroying the Republican party.  We are doing it to ourselves without their help.

<p>A commenter to my blog about libertarian kids implies that libertarians are okay&mdash;<a href="http://www.redstate.com/billhennessy/2013/03/12/why-libertarian-kids-not-drones-scare-mccain-and-graham/" target="_blank">as long as they&rsquo;re not, ya know, too libertarian</a>.</p>
<p>The other night at Heritage Tavern I heard debates break out over the definition of &ldquo;conservative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why the left is kicking our ass, now you know. They&rsquo;re busy turning Texas blue while we debate the meanings and merits of political labels.</p>
<p>Maybe this country is beyond hope.</p>

And stop debating the meaning of words.[/caption]</p>
