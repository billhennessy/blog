  content: Unfortunately this crime will never get investigated because MO has a Democrat
    Attorney General who will either ignore or excuse the crime.  Missouri citizens
    should be outraged by this invasion of privacy.

    upset--and singularly focused--the Republican Senators were yesterday. I went
    to Jefferson City to support bills to slow or stop Common Core and Obamacare,
    but no one wanted to talk about anything but DOR and Homeland Security.\r\n\r\nDig
    into the information on Missouri Family Network's site. They've done a fantastic
    job of research on this.   [ link: http://missourifamilynetwork.net/2013/03/ccw-dor-update-mfn-elert-dept-of-rev-violating-law/

  content: I am somewhat confused about the current outrage. Shouldn't the DOR verify,
    to the greatest extent possible, that an applicant for renewal of any state issued
    ID be who they maintain to be, live where they claim to live and so on. As to
    digitizing a photo ID what is wrong with that this? Taken together such policies
    dramatically reduce known issues such as the use of fraudulent ID's used for everything
    from identity theft by economic thieves, minor's access to liquor which increases
    the amount of vehicle deaths due to underage drinking, fraudulent voting, and
    fraud within social welfare programs. These are known issues and negatives while
    the concerns expressed here are concerns, not actual issues that victimize us
    in the same manner that the above examples are KNOWN to threaten us. However,
    I am against the collection of other data by the State before they issue a license.

  content: "If you're buying beer at Schnuck's, you expect the cashier to card you,
    right? That's because the cashier is required to verify that your are 21 or older.
    \r\n\r\n<strong>Wouldn't you think it creepy if the cashier took your picture
    and photocopied your driver's license?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you ask him why he
    took your picture and copied your DL, what if he told you, \"I'm going to forward
    this information to the federal government. I don't know why they want to know
    that you bought beer today, but they do.\"\r\n\r\nThere's no difference here.
    A fee collection office is just a supermarket for licenses and permits. The DOR's
    verification duties are set by Missouri law. So are its limits.\r\n\r\n<strong>Missouri
    law prohibits DOR from recording, by any means, personal identifying information.</strong>
    Missouri law also prohibits Missouri DOR from sharing that information.\r\n\r\nThe
    DOR fee office employees are under orders from the state to violate the law. <strong>Fee
    office workers were the first contact Missouri Family Network because they knew
    that they were breaking the law by using the new equipment and process.</strong>"

  content: We are no longer a nation of laws. Thanks to our Chief Executioner and
    his (Should be disbarred) Attorney General, Americans can be executed without
    trial IN THE STATES, people may be (or not be) prosecuted becase of their race
    and identification may be diverted for profiling for 2nd Amendment rights assertion,
    but not for voting identification! This is the man Americans re-elected for 4
    more years, while 4 million stayed home. We cannot continue down this path of
    erosion to our TRUE GOD GIVEN and Constitutional rights. Our MO AG is another
    example of a turncoat (former republican) trading integrity for electoral mobility,
    who has no true sense of ethics, only a sense of electibility. Watch out in 3
    1/2 years that he doesn't go for govenor, as did our last AG.

<p><strong>&ldquo;That is the third time you&rsquo;ve lied to me!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Those were the words of <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/13info/members/mem19.htm" target="_blank">Missouri State Senator Kurt Schaefer</a> to Director of Revenue Brian K. Long in a heated hearing at the Missouri State Capitol this morning. </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Missouri-Department-of-Revenue-Prying-Eyes.png"><img title="Missouri Department of Revenue - Prying Eyes" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Missouri Department of Revenue - Prying Eyes" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Missouri-Department-of-Revenue-Prying-Eyes_thumb.png" width="1028" height="252"></a></p>
<p>Senator Schaefer and <a href="http://missourifamilynetwork.net/2013/03/ccw-dor-update-mfn-elert-dept-of-rev-violating-law/" target="_blank">researchers at the Missouri Family Network, who broke this story,</a> learned prior to the hearing that Long&rsquo;s department has ordered Missouri fee office workers to violate state law by collecting and storing personal identifying information (PII) on everyone who renews a driver&rsquo;s license, non-driver ID, or concealed carry permit in Missouri.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://missourifamilynetwork.net/2013/03/ccw-dor-update-mfn-elert-dept-of-rev-violating-law/" target="_blank">Missouri Family Network</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>DOR is in fact (confirmed beyond question) retooling fee offices and requiring scanning of citizens&rsquo; source documents in violation of<b>32.091.7 RSMo </b>and <b>302.183 RSMo</b>, which according to <b>302.340 RSMo</b> constitutes a class A misdemeanor for each day&rsquo;s offense.&nbsp; (<i>see these laws reprinted below</i>)
<p>Source documents are being required and scanned for CCW endorsements or endorsement renewals beyond the background checks, certifications, investigations and other guidelines required under Missouri&rsquo;s Concealed Carry laws, and appear to be in violation of <b>571.101 RSMo</b> and related Statutes (<i>due to volume constraints, not reprinted here</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A variety of Missouri laws prohibit DOR from collecting PII. Missouri law also prohibits any state employee, including Brian Long, from complying with the federal Real ID act.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Long&rsquo;s office, however, used three Department of Homeland Security grants to circumvent the law, by installing biometric cameras in Missouri fee office and ordering fee office to record birth certificate and family residence data on everyone applying for a driver&rsquo;s license or concealed carry permit.</p>
<p>Later, Senators Schaefer and Brian Nieves took to the Senate floor to expose Long&rsquo;s lies and illegal activity. Senate President Pro Tem Dempsey called on Attorney General Chris Koster to investigate DOR.&nbsp; (Wish we had a real AG now.)</p>
<h4>Fee Office Workers Admit They&rsquo;re Feeding Your Data to Homeland Security</h4>
<p>We called the fee office in Union, Missouri, today. They confirmed that renewal of either DL or CCW permits required that they copy your birth certificate, driver&rsquo;s license, and proof of residency for use by Homeland Security.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For months, Long and others at the Department of Revenue have maintained that the DOR was not collecting personal information and was not attempting to comply with Real ID.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In meetings prior to today, Long had told Schaefer that the DOR was not using Homeland Security money to fund the purchase of biometric recording devices. </p>
<p>Missouri Family Network, however, uncovered clear evidence that Long&rsquo;s statements were false. </p>
<h4>What This Means To You</h4>
<p>This means that Missouri is collecting enough information on you to identify you with facial recognition technology, like the technology used to kill terrorists with drones and satellite guided missiles. </p>
<p>It means that if you work at a Missouri license fee office, you could be subject to a civil suit by anyone whose personal information you collected and turned over the Homeland Security.</p>
<p>It also means that Jay Nixon and Brian K. Long are circumventing Missouri law to feed your information into a master federal database of gun owners, identifiable by facial recognition software. </p>
<h4>What You Need To Do Right Now</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; If you suspect that a fee office has photo copied any of your documents or used biometric photography, you could be the victim of a crime.&nbsp; You can report it to the Missouri Department of Revenue&rsquo;s Criminal Investigation office <a href="mailto:cibmail@dor.mo.gov">cibmail@dor.mo.gov</a>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Contact Governor Jay Nixon and ask him why his DOR violates Missouri privacy law. Phone: (573) 751-3222.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Because this involves misuse of federal grant money, contact your US <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/" target="_blank">Representative</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm" target="_blank">Senator</a> and ask them to investigate. </p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Contact your Missouri State <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/legislatorlookup.aspx" target="_blank">Representative</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/" target="_blank">Senator</a>, asking them to pass legislation that requires removal of biometric imaging devices from DOR fee office and indemnifies DOR fee office workers from law suits. </p>
