  content: "Totally agree. Most thinking conservatives, even police officers,agree
    the time has come to decriminalize marijuana. \r\n\r\nSociety has a tendency,
    in general, to reel from the idea of decriminalizing pot yet arch conservatives
    such as William F. Buckley strongly supported the idea years ago. \r\n\r\nHere
    are a few, and I mean just a few, important elements to keep in mind regarding
    the \"War on Drugs,\" of which pot is a major battle.\r\n\r\nDecriminalization,
    note I am not saying legalization, merely allows the personal use and possession
    of small quantities similar to that allowed for decades in Amsterdam. It has the
    same restrictions as smoking as well as punishment for \"intoxication\" in public,
    especially when driving. No laws prohibit workplace drug testing and employees
    could still be fired for a positive finding. This is common sense as marijuana
    use has been shown to contribute to work place accidents and threats to safety
    due to its intoxicating effects.\r\n\r\nWe waste far too much criminal justice
    time, effort, and money on prohibition."

  content: Agreed, The war on drugs has cost more, than decriminalization ever would,
    of course there will always be " nit wits" like the women who filmed giving her
    2 y/o a hit from a bong pipe of MJ on her cell phone, but Alcohol is more damaging
    to people, and its legal. The war on drugs  has never been updated, they just
    keep doing the same thing over and over, expecting a different result every time=insanity.
    Instead of changing what does not work and sticking with what does. You cant legislate
    morality, or stupidity, but you dont punish everyone else, The media is partially
    to blame for the ignorance of this mom, as they have glamorized MJ in movies and
    music, for years, but i am not for censorship at all, just education and personal
    responsibilty.

  content: "Good points. You know, about half of all arrests for drugs are for possession
    of small amounts of marijuana or paraphernalia. \n\nBtw, thanks for comment on
    my previous post about the DOR. I needed to clarify the issue, and your challenge
    helped me see that."

    Legalization of marijuana would reduce the violence.

<p>A lot. Marijuana prohibition costs enough to put more than <strong>900 new police officers on the streets</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the numbers from <a href="http://show-mecannabis.com/budgetary-implications-legalizing-marijuana-missouri/" target="_blank">Harvard and Cato scholar Jeffrey A. Miron and marijuana law reform researcher Abhi Sivasailam (via Show-Me Cannabis)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Missouri would <strong>save about $90 million in government expenditure and yield roughly $59 million in tax revenue annually</strong>. This assumes that marijuana would be taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco and that all other states and the federal government would also legalize.</p></blockquote>
<p>What could we do with an extra $149 million in the budget?</p>
<p>We could increase funding for mental health, help the disabled, open medical clinics for the poor, or treat <a href="http://www.dependency.net/learn/marijuana/" target="_blank">marijuana dependency</a>.</p>
<p>We could also cut taxes and pay for Jay Nixon&rsquo;s private plane.</p>
<p>Nationally, we spend $100 billion a year on the drug war. <strong>That&rsquo;s $11 billion <em>more</em> than sequestration</strong>.</p>
<p>What marijuana reform could also do is make a lot of under-utilized people far more productive. You know how hard it is to get a good job with a misdemeanor criminal record for marijuana possession?</p>
<p>Within my dad&rsquo;s lifetime, we locked people up for possession of beer. <strong>Prohibition was an attempt by progressives to perfect human beings, to end social problems, and to control behavior</strong>.</p>
<p>It failed miserably, leaving behind corruption in government from Washington DC to Washington state. Prohibition threw people out of work, damaged reputations and lives, and fostered an organized crime network we spend millions fighting.</p>
<p>The war on weed has been no less damaging.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find a single study that concludes the war on pot saves or money.</p>
<p><strong>So why do we wage it?</strong></p>
<p>I want to hear from you. Do you think marijuana prohibition is worth $149 million?</p>
<p>Now go read my original post on <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/01/01/its-time-to-end-war-on-weed/">The War on Weed</a></p>
