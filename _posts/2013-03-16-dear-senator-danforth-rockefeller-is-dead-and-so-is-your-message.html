  content: Another excellent, prophetic post.  You called it correctly when you stated
    "Danforth  and his cronies are playing with fire."  I'd see that fire burn the
    Republican party to the ground before I one more day support these irrelevant
    Constitution-shredding hacks.  Playing politics the Danforth / McCain / Graham
    way has brought this country to its knees.

  content: We, the little people, are done with being ignored and trampled on by  Establishment
    dinosaurs like McCain, Graham and Danforth. They no more stand for the Republican
    platform than Pelosi, Ried or Carter. We need brave and vocal souls like Ed Martin
    to bring this country back to it's foundational principles of the people, for
    the people, by the people. It is time to take this country back to the original
    God-given purpose of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all, not just
    for some as deemed fit by John Danforth et al!

  content: I finally gave up on the Republican Party last summer when it finally dawned
    on me why its nominee was the favorite son of the Danforth-McCain-Rove coalition
    and pretty much rammed down our throats. Equally unhappy with the Libertarians
    because too many of them believe killing innocent unborn babies to be civilized
    free American behavior, I went in search of an alternative. I found the Constitution
    Party. It had a presidential ticket and a few candidates at the state level.

  content: Been there before.  Jackoff Danforth and his kind were told long ago they
    were wrecking the Party.  Their attitude was, "so what, as long as WE control
    the wreckage."  It's always the same deal.  Either generate enough income after
    taxes to be one of THEM, or get lost.  But They and their libtard allies make
    that Impossible.  Don't they?  We don't care if the Danforths despise us.  But
    they're the source of Our frustration.

  content: Excellent article! It seems the movers in the Republican Party, the McCains,
    Grahams, and Roves, have more in common with Liberals than with their own base.
    Sure, they are more than willing to coddle Tea Party Conservatives come election
    time and also more than willing to kick their base to the curb when the election
    is over. We have known for a long time that our biggest battles would come from
    within the Republican Party. Looks like fightin time is here.

  content: "You're right, Corey. When the history of the Republican Party is written,
    I believe people like McCain, Graham, and Danforth will fare poorly. They offer
    value to a tiny, select few who want government money and protection for various
    endeavors. People who want to transfer risk to taxpayers the way the investment
    houses began transferring risk to stockholders in the late 80s. \n\nEventually,
    that risk, multiplied and fermented, explodes back on them."

  content: Bill, I think you have nailed it, again.  Ed Martin's email was, I think,
    the beginning of a New Vision for the MO GOP.  It will take a while for the old
    guard to see that vision, but they can choose to either ride the wave or be swept
    away by it.

    chose Danforth to deliver this message. Did they think his august stature would
    drive us all into immediate compliance? \n\nDanforth's stature was never as significant
    as a few people on the east side of Missouri believed. Today, he's a footnote.
    <strong>No one under the age of 43 ever voted for Danforth</strong> whose last
    election was during the Reagan administration."

  content: "You had it right - this is all about trying to dry up donors, no matter
    what price the party pays in the next election. \r\n\r\nThe answer is to identify
    them by name, identify their causes, and put a spotlight on them.  If their actions
    are above reproach, they won't mind it.  We're not driving anyone out of the party.
    \ We're being transparent about how things get done.  That's only frightening
    to those whose power comes from whispered conversations. \r\n\r\nI don't believe
    Danforth acted alone.  I don't believe his email magically appeared in the Post
    Dispatch.  Whoever coordinated this needs to be discovered and held up.  Danforth's
    staff needs to have a video camera held to their face, Russ Carnahan style. \r\n\r\nIf
    you work for the Establishment, I want you worried that your next job won't come
    from cronies paying you back for stabbing conservatives."

  content: "In the world of big Republican donors and cocktail parties, Mr. Danforth
    is not a footnote, though.  That's why he's the messenger.\r\n\r\nWhat they haven't
    figured out, though, is that 1) Money is not enough to win elections these days,
    and 2) There is a huge donor base who are just waiting for the right \"vision\"
    before they'll engage and replace the \"old money\".  \r\n\r\nThe vision isn't
    a new one, in fact, it's as old as the Founders -- it's a vision of liberty.   \r\n\r\nIt's
    a vision that eschews mercantilism and embraces true free-market capitalism.  It's
    a vision that understands the (limited) role of government and the evils of concentrated
    power.  It's a vision that truly believes that our basic human rights are bestowed
    by our Creator, and no man, or group of men -- no matter how large the marble
    building housing them is -- have the authority to deprive us of those rights.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a vision that more and more people are, once again, willing to fight and bleed
    and die for.\r\n\r\nEd Martin gets it, Mr. Danforth does not seem to understand."

  content: I received Ed Martin's e-mail and didn't read any mention of "throwing
    out" anyone.  What I DID read was a preliminary plan of action to move the Missouri
    GOP back to its limited government principles  The "old guard" of the Republican
    party have moved the party more and more left with their progressive policies
    to the point where it is impossible to tell the difference between the two main
    parties.  The elite, establishment portion of the GOP are extremely worried they
    are losing the stranglehold on the power and wealth they once possessed and are
    acting accordingly.  I once read, "You can tell if you are on the right side of
    an argument by those arguing against."  I feel satisfied standing with Ed Martin,
    Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and thousands of grassroot activists.  I am no longer
    voting the "letter", I am voting the individual.

  content: "If I recall rightly, wasn't State Senator Brian Nieves attacked by the
    GOP in his primary election a few years ago.  I've also heard that he continues
    to fight against his own GOP party as well as the Dems. He is a true Tea Party
    hero--they despise him.\r\n\r\nI also saw the establishment GOP in action at several
    caucuses in Missouri against the Ron Paul people.\r\n\r\nIt is my personal opinion
    that when the establishment GOP disenfranchised the Ron Paul delegates at the
    national convention, the Ron Paul people stayed home instead of voting.  That
    is why there were fewer Republicans voting and why we still have King Odumbo ruling
    over us. \r\n\r\nIn addition, all you have to do to see the liberalism of the
    Danforth's is walk through the campus of the bastion of liberalism-Washington
    University in St. Louis.  There name is all over that place.\r\n\r\nLet's not
    forget the stem cell proposition from a few years ago too.  The Danforth's funded
    that liberal cause."

    not so much you, but who the Tea Party says is picking and choosing about who
    they want to let into the party. Two years ago when the after parties started
    I asked if my blog, The Conservative Cauldron could be put on the Tea Party website
    blogroll. I was told that they did not want to do it because I was Wiccan.\r\n

  content: There is no reason to call each other names.  Mr. Danforth represents a
    point of view that varies in a number of important ways from that of the Tea Party
    and constitutional conservatives, which have rejected some of the norms familiar
    to Mr. Danforth.  He has a right to express his opinion, and Mr. Martin has a
    right to disagree.  The idea is not to promote or destroy the GOP, but rather
    to promote candidates who stand for the smallest, least intrusive government that
    can do its constitutional duties effectively.  I am not sure that either Mr. Danforth
    or Mr. Martin are credible to the electorate right now.  I don't think what either
    man says will move the GOP in MO.  Mr. Martin was defeated in his last two bids
    for public office and Mr. Danforth got his experience in another era with generations
    older than I, and I am a senior citizen.  .

  content: Thanks for this essay, Bill. It is right on target. Mostly what we're hearing
    are the dying pangs of an old breed who can't stand it that they no longer run
    the GOP the old way anymore, in the back of a smoke filled room. Today better,
    more thoughtful minds of the party are running away from them. Although the "old
    guard" of the Republican Party mocks the Tea Party, they fail to realize that
    the Tea Party is made up of mostly pissed off young Conservative Republicans and
    Libertarians who are horrified that the Republican Party was  more bent on embracing
    internecine party tyranny than freedom and liberty. The old Guard has been "progressive"
    to the detriment of the party, the country, and the Constitution.  Many are feckless
    appeasers who don't understand that true leadership and power comes from courage,
    principle and the willingness when faced with defeat to get up and fight better,
    which is what we saw in the Rand Paul filibuster. It's time we open the windows
    and doors and let in the light and fresh air. That's what the likes of Ted Cruz,
    Rand Paul, Paul Ryan, and yes, even Ed Martin are all about.

<p>Old Jack Danforth is a troubled man.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_13392" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/potter-faceless.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13392 " style="margin-left: 10px;" alt="John Danforth Attacked Ed Martin for Supporting Rand Paul" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/potter-faceless-300x200.png" width="300" height="200" /></a> "You once called me a 'warped, frustrated old man.' Well, what are you, but a warped, frustrated young man?"<br />John Danforth Attacked Ed Martin for Supporting Rand Paul[/caption]</p>
<p>Danforth's wiry frame got bent all out of shape because the chairman of Missouri&rsquo;s GOP stated the uber-obvious in an email to friends: <a title="Why Libertarian Kids, Not Drones, Scare McCain and Graham" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/12/why-here-is-the-real-reason-mccain-and-graham-lost-their-minds-over-rand-pauls-filibuster/"><strong>the McCain-Graham angry old man meme ain&rsquo;t sellin&rsquo; no more</strong></a>. What is selling is Rand Paul's courageous demand for a statement on the limits of executive power.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Ed Martin sent an email to Missouri Republicans praising Paul's courage and rebuking McCain and Graham's defense of unlimited presidential power.</p>
<p>On Thursday,<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-fix/ed-martin-s-message-to-gop-draws-rebuke-from-danforth/article_006d0f8d-9354-5105-9e07-597d5cc386f9.html" target="_blank"> former Senator John Danforth responded with an email</a> criticizing Martin and accusing the chairman of the Missouri GOP of kicking people out of the party.</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s email praised the <strong>courage</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong> Senator Rand Paul displayed in his famous 13-hour filibuster. It also derided McCain and Graham for their childish and un-Senatorial attacks on fellow Republican Paul. Why Danforth felt a need to reply, and why he felt a need to exaggerate Ed Martin's message, tells me there's &nbsp;more going on here than just an angry, irrelevant old man spouting off.</p>
<h4>Missouri's Republican Establishment Is At War With the Grassroots</h4>
<blockquote><p>You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter. In the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider!</p>
<p>--George Bailey to Mr. Potter</p></blockquote>
<p>When Ed Martin won the race for MOGOP chairman, the establishment was stunned and horrified. Martin appeals to conservative and libertarian grassroots activists, not the smoky room king makers that Danforth favors.</p>
<p>I think the Establishment believed they could intimidate Martin by threatening to cut off donations to the MOGOP and to Republican candidates who won't do their bidding.</p>
<p>With Martin continuing to display his populist independent streak, the Establishment called out their version of Mr. Potter to play bad cop, keeping the others' noses clean.</p>
<h4>This Could All End In Disaster for Missouri Republicans</h4>
<p>Danforth &nbsp;and his cronies are playing with fire. In November 2012, 90,000 votes were cast for Libertarian candidates in Missouri. Most of those votes came at the expense of Republican votes.</p>
<p>If the grassroots--and especially young voters--get the feeling that the GOP is a private club for the rich, they'll flee to the Libertarian Party in 2014. And if the RNC installs rules meant to block non-Establishment presidential candidates at their April meeting in Los Angeles, 2016 could be the Republican Party's last national election.</p>
<h4>It's All Happened Before</h4>
<p>Before the modern Republican Party emerged from the abolitionist movement in 1858, America's other major party was the Whigs. &nbsp;Abraham Lincoln led the Whig Party in Illinois. But the Whigs were never a cohesive party of consistency around some set of principles. Instead, they were united only by their opposition to an imperial presidency. From the History Channel:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Whig party was founded by individuals united only in their antagonism to Jackson's war on the Second Bank of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/states">United States</a>&nbsp;and his high-handed measures in waging that war and ignoring Supreme Court decisions, the Constitution, and Indian rights embodied in federal treaties. Beyond that, however, there were Whigs and Whigs. Some played the demagogic anti-Catholic game; others scorned it. Some spoke critically of working people; others, admiringly. Detailed studies of the Whig party in the states and biographies of such Whig leaders as Clay,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/william-seward">William Seward</a>, Daniel Webster, and Horace Greeley reveal dissimilar policies from one state to another and important differences in the character, beliefs, and actions of the leaders.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that opposition to Barack Obama is the only thing that unifies Republicans. But many of us realize that Obama won't be on the ballot in 2016. So what will the GOP stand for?</p>
<p>Within the GOP today, I see two large factions. One is the Establishment personified by McCain, Graham, and Danforth. The other is, for lack of a better term, <strong>the Tea Party faction united on the principles of free markets, Constitutionally limited government, and fiscal responsibility</strong>. The Establishment stood around befuddled in 2009 and 2010 as the Tea Party did the work to regain control of the House and dozens of state legislatures. And that Tea Party success is what started the current rift.</p>
<p>Leading up to 2012, the Establishment, recognizing that the rabble were within striking distance of seizing <em>their</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;party, went on the offensive--not against the Democrats, and not in support of those basic, simple principles. The GOP Establishment went to war against its own grassroots base.</p>
<p>Like the Whigs of 1856, the Republicans of 2016 seem poised for a horrible fall. The millions of rabble who want the party to stand for three simple principles don't understand why Danforth and his spiders insist on keeping the party a closed country club. We don't understand why Danforth won't invite in the libertarian kids. They won't steal his millions, I promise.</p>
<h4>Who's Kicking Who Out, Mr. Danforth</h4>
<p>With that background, isn't it sad that Danforth's vitriolic email to wealthy Republican donors accused Martin of doing exactly what Danforth and his scurvy spiders have been doing for years: deciding who may and may not call themselves Republicans.</p>
<p>In 2005, Danforth all but called for the expulsion of Christian conservatives from the GOP's ranks. And he did so in that Republican of Republican rags, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/opinion/30danforth.html?_r=0" target="_blank">the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Isn't it sad that a man whose tent is closed to Christians and, now, libertarians accused Ed Martin of minding the gate?</p>
<p><a title="Why GOP Pandering to Young Voters Backfires" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/25/why-gop-pandering-to-young-voters-backfires/" target="_blank">Ed Martin understands that young people smell hypocrisy better than old men like Danforth</a>. And even Bill Hennessy. &nbsp;Ed's email simply praised Rand Paul's courage in raising a vital question that Danforth should also be asking: <a href="http://www.conservativehq.com/article/12580-rand-paul-speech-cpac-makes-our-case-liberty-prize" target="_blank">is there a limit to Executive Power</a>?</p>
<p>McCain and Graham--and, by proxy, Danforth--seem okay with unlimited executive power to assassinate American citizens. &nbsp;They apparently were content to leave the American President with absolute power. And if they oppose such tyrannical power, they are unwilling to confront the President on the matter.</p>
<p>That puts them at odds even with Attorney General Eric Holder. &nbsp;Forced by Senator Paul's 13-hour filibuster, Holder admitted that the President lacks the Constitutional authority to order the assassination of Americans on American soil. &nbsp;That's an admission the White House refused to make for months until Senator Paul forced its hand.</p>
<p>Neither McCain nor Graham nor Danforth lifted a finger to press this fundamental human right and this enormous Constitutional question. <strong>Rand Paul did, and Ed Martin was right to point out it out</strong>.</p>
<h4>Those Scurvy Little Spiders</h4>
<p>I'll leave you with George Bailey's speech to Mr. Potter as the board of Bailey Brothers Building and Loan met to dissolve the firm upon George's dad's death.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him. But to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well in my book, my father died a much richer man than you'll ever be!</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>John Danforth and his nest of scurvy spiders should consider that their money can't buy blind loyalty from the rabble they so despise</strong>. There are more of us than there are of them. Nothing guarantees that a political party will last forever, and the arrogance of the Establishment threatens to destroy the party that men like Danforth seem to love more than the country that party's supposed to serve.</p>
