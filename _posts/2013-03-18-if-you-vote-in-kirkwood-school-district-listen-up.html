  content: Kirkwood School District is a microcosm of what's happening on the national
    level.  Too much spending for mandates and programs never voted on by the voters.  Only
    30% of taxpayers have their children in KSD schools.  It's time for the 70% to
    speak out against this amazing increase of taxation for little improvement in
    test scores.

<p>In the past 15 years, Kirkwood School Districts operation costs have skyrocketed almost 100 percent. But the people paying the taxes for that district have seen a cost of living increase of only 44 percent.</p>

<p>Obviously, at some point, the system will crash. Unless you do something now.</p>
<p><strong>On April 2, you can elect two fiscally responsible members to the board of education</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a class="btn btn-primary btn-xlarge" href="http://peterson4kirkwoodschools.com/">Eric Peterson</a> and <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xlarge" href="http://www.educatekirkwood.org/">Amy Russell</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.k-pep.org/" target="_blank">Visit Kirkwood Pioneers for Educational Progress</a> to learn all about the issues that threaten your district&rsquo;s financial future and the opportunities to make the district even stronger.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Get to know <a href="http://peterson4kirkwoodschools.com/" target="_blank">Eric Peterson</a> and <a href="http://www.educatekirkwood.org/" target="_blank">Amy Russell</a>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Tell your friends you&rsquo;re voting on April 2 for fiscal responsibility and better schools.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Unless you want to be a real High Information Voter</strong>. Then <a href="http://www.k-pep.org/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=43" target="_blank">you will want to read K-PEP&rsquo;s Executive Summary</a>. You&rsquo;ll be the real education expert in your conversation groups, and your opinion will carry a lot of weight with other voters.</p>
<p>Just because you don&rsquo;t have children in school right now doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re free of the duty to be informed and to vote.</p>
<p>Good school districts raise property values and improves lives. Fiscally irresponsible districts threaten the whole community.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave this duty up to anyone else. Take responsibility for your community by getting informed and voting.</p>
