<p>The <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=780D5921-8ABC-4954-ADC1-6C6A522AC300" target="_blank">GOP&rsquo;s self-examination on the 2012 election debacle</a> rightly identifies marketing and messaging and lack of a ground game as contributors to that mess.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Trust.jpg"><img title="Trust" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Trust" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Trust_thumb.jpg" width="754" height="604"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the GOP&rsquo;s self-exam missed a potentially fatal problem for the party: <strong>the American people simply do not trust Republicans on the budget</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://thehill.com/polls/288641-hill-poll-voters-prefer-gop-budget-ideas-but-dislike-republican-party-" target="_blank">Read this paragraph from The Hill carefully</a>.&nbsp; Read all of it. It should tell you everything you need to know.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>More voters trust the Democratic Party</strong> than the Republican Party on budgetary issues, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill &mdash; <strong>even though a strong majority actually prefer Republican fiscal policies</strong> [emphases added].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now do see how bad things are for the Republicans?</p>
<h4>Marketing Can&rsquo;t Fix Trust</h4>
<p>Bad marketing is fairly easy to fix. The world is full of marketing scientists, strategists, and copywriters. It&rsquo;s just a matter of humility and money.</p>
<p>But marketing can&rsquo;t fix a company that people just don&rsquo;t trust. And, right now, people don&rsquo;t trust the Republicans. What&rsquo;s worse is that <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/rnc-report-growth-and-opportunity-88987.html" target="_blank">the GOP did not identify trust among its seven problems</a>.</p>
<h4>Are Republicans Incompetent Or Threatening?</h4>
<p>Trust comes in two forms: Warmth and Competence. According to researchers, <a href="http://www.relationalcapitalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Warmth-Competence-2007.pdf" target="_blank">social animals&mdash;like people&mdash;must evaluate others on two scales with these questions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they mean me harm or good?
<li>Are they competent to deliver on their intent? </li>
</ul>
<p>The Hill poll did not delve into this question, but we know this much: 55 percent of Americans believe that the GOP is lying about the Ryan budget (threat) or incapable of carrying it out (incompetent) or both.</p>
<h4>Here Are the Numbers on Budget Preferences</h4>
<p>The Hill designed their poll so people wouldn&rsquo;t know which party proposed which budget solutions. When presented this way, here&rsquo;s how people responded:</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Hill-Budget-Poll.png"><img title="The Hill Budget Poll" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The Hill Budget Poll" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Hill-Budget-Poll_thumb.png" width="641" height="186"></a></p>
<p>The Ryan Budget beats the Patty Murray Budget by a whopping 55-28. Even among women, Ryan&rsquo;s budget wins 51-27.</p>
<p>But now look at which party people trust to fix the budget problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Hill-Budget-Poll-Party.png"><img title="The Hill Budget Poll-Party" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The Hill Budget Poll-Party" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Hill-Budget-Poll-Party_thumb.png" width="650" height="152"></a></p>
<p>While 55 percent prefer the Republican budget, only 30 percent trust the GOP on budgetary issues.</p>
<h4>The GOP Needs To Learn More About The Trust Issue</h4>
<p>Marketing begins with research, and The Hill poll gives the Republicans an immediate challenge: find out if people think they&rsquo;re insincere, incompetent, or both.</p>
<p>In the past, the party and politicians and pundits would simply argue with people, telling the public it&rsquo;s wrong. That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And better messaging won&rsquo;t either. Not until the Republicans know why people don&rsquo;t trust them.</p>
<p>How the GOP handles this trust issue will tell a lot, and quickly, about its future. If they choose to fight public opinion before understanding it, the Republican candidate for President in 2016 might not finish in the top two.</p>
