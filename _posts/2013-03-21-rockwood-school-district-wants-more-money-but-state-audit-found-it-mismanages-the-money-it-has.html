  content: we need to have a capitalist govt, it does no good at all to go on and
    on discussing specific issues, the problem is not one single tax, or expenditure,
    the problem is socialism. We need to demand that our candidates publish a specific
    agenda before they can be considered, and all the incumbents that have voted socialist
    have to be considered exempt from being considered.

  content: We need to have a free market rights amendment. we have no protection from
    govt owning a business or chartering a monopoly in either the fed or state constitution.
    In this state we can use ballot initiative. we can abolish the right of any govt
    (state, county, or city) to own a business or give one business monopoly rights.
    (and we need to get the "peoples republicans" out of the party)

  content: We need to have a flat state tax of 1% after the first $25,000, no exemptions
    , no deductions, from each individual. This should be collected a year in advance,
    (no spending money this year based on what they think we will make next year,
    the amount collected will be the budget, no deficit spending) until the state
    debt is paid, 20% of what is collected must go to the debt. This would automatically
    end all socialist taxes, (special tax, sales tax, property tax withholding and
    payroll)

  content: we need to close the state branches of the fed/state bureaucracy govt.
    as long as we allow that to exist, that is our de facto govt. We need to sell
    the assets of that bureaucracy back into the economy at a zero minimum, closed
    bid auction, open to any citizen of Missouri, with no restrictions on the use
    or sale of those assets, along with any businesses owned by them (IE state owned
    colleges)

  content: It is embarrassing that a 3/4 republican state legislature has passed mosira,
    aerotropolis, a barge subsidy, a soccer subsidy, a hiring subsidy etc, etc, etc,
    The problem with the economy is the socialism, we don't want "conservative" socialism,
    we don't want "cheaper" socialism. We don't want "simpler" socialism. we don't
    want republican socialism. We want to end the socialism and live in a free capitalist
    country.

  content: It's OK to tell them to "shut up" The socialist will insist on constant
    debate on meaningless side issues while their takeover is implemented, It's OK
    to say " I will explain it to you later" don't get roped into discussing whether
    a commodity is good or not (such as health care) say simply that it may not be
    owned by the govt. Do not let them get you to discuss how cheap it is (even when
    you know it's never cheap from them) and say only that the govt may not own it.

  content: every fascist policy has it's own built in fail safe mechanism. They will
    tell you about wonderful things done for people who badly needed it by social
    security. Why do we need social security? because you are going to need it ! why
    do we need it? because all that money was with held from our paychecks and "contributed"
    to social security ! Why do we need to pay for social security ? because you are
    going to need it ! etc etc etc.

  content: I have never heard of the five candidate forums. I will not be voting for
    anyone who does not publish their intentions online for me (and everyone else)
    to see. There is not one of the elected officials in the republican party that
    are not socialist. All of the republican voters are capitalist, but none of our
    officials. that is why prop "c" passed by so much. not one single politician will
    even use the word "socialism" let alone admit that is the problem. We need to
    have more ballot initiatives, such as a commercial rights amendment, and a flat
    tax, we will never get our freedom back from any of the incumbents .

  content: has even one, just one, published an agenda online? is even one of them
    a capitalist? I WILL NOT vote for another pink elephant. let them publish their
    agenda and if they have held office before after I have looked up their voting
    record, I will be happy to work full time for any capitalist candidates. Where
    are they? who are they? I am not going to waste any more of my life listening
    to rhetoric from socialist. They will not answer any questions at these events
    and certainly don't have time to go through the whole "devils dialogue" on every
    single issue.

<p>Were Rockwood School District to shut down, the entire bond-issue-campaign-financing industry would slump into depression.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_12113" align="alignright" width="284"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/humiliation.jpg"><img class="wp-image-12113 " alt="Rockwood School District Hasn't Learned" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/humiliation.jpg" width="284" height="382" /></a> Rockwood School District wants another $38 million bond issue on the heals of scathing audit of its financial management practices.I&rsquo;ve lived in this district since 1996, and I honestly don&rsquo;t remember an April in which the board wasn&rsquo;t asking for more money to carpet the football fields or remodel 12-year-old theatres or build an observatory or whatever.[/caption]</p>
<p>Yes, the education is good. But it was good before the building binge started in the late 1990s. And a lot of that quality education has to do with great teachers and strong families. I&rsquo;m no expert, but my guess is that if you replicated Rockwood&rsquo;s structural facilities inside the city limits of St. Louis, the quality of education in the city wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Eileen Tyrell and Lisa Hunt Earls formed <a href="http://rsdstakeholders.org/" target="_blank">Rockwood Stakeholders</a> to give some oversight to the district. Their work has been remarkable. They pulled together real experts and sincere, level-headed citizens into an organization that should be replicated in every school district in the country.</p>
<p>Last year, Rockwood Stakeholders succeeding in getting an audit of the district from State Auditor Tom Schweich.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.auditor.mo.gov/Press/2013-018.pdf" target="_blank">The results were less complimentary to the district</a>. (Yes, that&rsquo;s understatement.) And <a href="http://rsdstakeholders.org/2013/03/04/rockwood-school-district-citizens-group-calls-for-rockwood-resignations/" target="_blank">mismanagement of construction money was the biggest problem uncovered</a>.</p>
<p>So now RSD has another ballot initiative on the April 2 ballot. Here&rsquo;s how Rockwood Stakeholders summarized the temerity of asking for money when you can&rsquo;t handle the money you&rsquo;ve been granted:</p>
<blockquote><p>As an advocate group for taxpayers, parents, employees and students of the Rockwood School district, RS for RS feels the Board and district officials needs to work on rebuilding the community&rsquo;s trust and credibility which was lost over the recent disclosure of questionable and unethical business practices involving bond construction, vendor and consultant contracts and the lack of transparency.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. So I say:</p>
<h4>Vote No on Prop S on April 2.</h4>
<p>While some of the objectives of the proposal are worthwhile, most of the board and its administration remains the same people called out in the state audit.</p>
<h4>Vote for New Blood on the Board on April 2</h4>
<p>Now comes Andrew Bemus, student Opinion Editor of the Marquette High School online newspaper The Messenger.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marquettemessenger.com/opinion/2013/03/14/andrews-approach-amidst-all-the-turmoil-in-the-district-board-candidates-morrell-and-mondl-are-the-best-bet-for-the-future/" target="_blank">Andrew reviews the audit&rsquo;s findings and proposes a smart solution</a>: elect two new board members on April 2, and make it two people with fresh perspectives.</p>
<blockquote><p>That leaves voters with two candidates for two seats. Those candidates are teacher <strong>Loralee Mondl</strong> and Business Executive <strong>Jeffrey Morrell</strong>. Both of these candidates bring something to the table that is badly needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Rockwood teacher and a businessman who come from outside the present board.</p>
<p>Make sense to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip, Andrew. You saved me a lot of research for the April 2 election. And thanks to Eileen, Lisa, Doug, and the folks who work so hard to keep Rockwood School District effective and efficient.</p>
