<p>I'm not the biggest NCAA basketball fan in the world, but the SLU Billikens rev up my heart whenever they make a push in the tournament.</p>
<p>It's heartwarming to see all the love spilling over from Mizzou fans to the Bills, as <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/bernie-miklasz/bernie-bytes-mizzou-fans-adopting-slu/article_b83e5f9c-e1c9-51e9-afd1-c66a28a14760.html" target="_blank">Bernie Miklasz documents in a post today</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyway, I thought I'd present the Twitter responses to my question. There's a good mix here ... some humor, some bitterness and some harmless "hater" stuff too. As well as some anti-Kansas sentiment and a shot at Ole Miss hot dog&nbsp;<strong>Marshall Henderson</strong>. I even heard from a couple of Illinois fans, including the mayor of Jacksonville, Ill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't you love to see the Bills drive into the final four? And while I'm asking questions, if you're a Mizzou fan, have you adopted the Billikens?</p>
