<p>Reuters reports (via <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-24/switzerland-next-swiss-banks-set-foward-confidential-bank-client-data-us-officials" target="_blank">ZeroHedge</a>) that Switzerland has reached a secret deal with the United States to assist the US government in conducted a Cyprus-style confiscation of deposits held in Swiss bank accounts.</p>
<blockquote><p>The question then is: how many of the oligarchs, Russian or otherwise, who avoided a complete wipe out and total capital controls in Cyprus, will wait to find out if the same fate will befall them in Switzerland? Or Luxembourg? Or Lichtenstein? Or Singapore?</p>
<p>Or any other formerly considered "tax-haven" nation?</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be a very interesting week in the banking world. <a title="Bankers and Politicians Are Robbing People Everywhere" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/24/bankers-and-politicians-are-robbing-people-everywhere/" target="_blank">I told you that the appetite of elites for other people's money is insatiable</a>.</p>
<p>What would a run on Swiss accounts look like?</p>
