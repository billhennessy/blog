  content: Thanks Bill for the video of Gina Loudon.  She speaks the truth and isn't
    afraid to go outside her comfort zone to do so.  To win this country back from
    the radicals who are now running it, we must win the culture war.  Gina is right.  We
    can not win the political war until we first win the culture war.

  content: "Dear Gina,\r\n\r\n\"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.\"
    Proverbs 27:17 (NIV)  Keep on challenging us.  You are right.  We can't win the
    battle if we are in retreat.  We need to put on that armor and run to the battle.
    \ Don't worry about mistakes, they are all redeemed by His precious Blood.  And
    you never know that the Holy Spirit will use to touch people.  Papa God loves
    people so much, He will keep calling to their hearts so that at least some won't
    be lost.\r\n\r\nGod Bless,\r\n\r\nGayle"

    Bible.. then become a coward when confronted with someone who disagrees with your
    preaching. WHAT A COWARD BOTH THE WIFE AND THE HUSBAND FOR NOT FULFILLING THEIR
    COMMITMENT TO THE SHOW. Even their older children can see the hypocrisy their
    parents spew. You can just tell the oldest daughter was humiliated by the whole
    experience.

    Loraine,
    IYO was greed the motivation for the other family?  They didn't list $ as their motivation for doing this show..  Do you believe they are also spinning their self serving actions?   You found it so easy to judge the Loudons but never mentioned the other family.   Perhaps you are also self serving.  Just saying......

    The Loudons went into this with the intention of showing that conservatives aren't "closed minded stereotypes" and had the exact opposite effect.  What a chickenshit thing to do, sicking your lawyer on the producers so you could drop out early for a show YOU signed up for.  You represent everything that's wrong with this country wrapped in one hateful, ugly package.  Thank you for proving all the stereotypes true...and then some.

    The kids seem like sweethearts.  Shame their parents are so judgmental and cowardly.  People like this aren't true Christians and would crucify Jesus in a heartbeat if he walked the earth today.

    show everything that happened in either household.  This was an ambush from the
    beginning and the Loudons stayed with it as long as they could and followed the
    program rules long after the Envy's refused to comply.

    that set up debacle, that there was any hope of there being an "even exchange
    of thoughts", you are the perfect obama voter.  One who cannot connect the actual
    dots and make a reasonable prediction of the outcome.  And, you top that off by
    speaking for people you don't know as if you are the authority on their views.  Unfortunately,
    people like you are the reason that an "even exchange of thoughts" is impossible.

  content: It never ceases to amaze me how the left loves to brand as hypocrites anyone
    who doesn't share their views.  Did it ever occur to you that the Envys were unwilling
    to be open minded to the values of the Loudon family from the beginning?  Gina
    Loudon appropriately asked that the other adult (second wife) leave.  She had
    no reason to believe that she was signing up to be ambushed by two adults who
    would break the rules at will - refusing to leave, watching TV.  The Envys were
    determined to do whatever they wanted and Gina and John chose not to finish the
    episode after Gina was forced out of the Envy home under a barrage of insults.  Why
    would you expect her to come back for more bullying?  And, clearly, you are also
    a bully -- name calling nine words into your post.

  content: Yes Cheryl....I relished the moment. She got what she deserved. Gina was
    NOT thrown out. Both you and Bill are lying about that exchange between Chris
    and Gina. Chris said and I quote, "No one is making you sit here. The door's right
    there, Gina, the door's right there. Walk. It's my house right? Walk" Gina replies
    "Happy to walk". and then just sits there staring at Chris with those bug eyed
    hate filled eyes.... and Chris then says. You're still sitting there" Gina finally
    realizes she's lost the argument and gets up to pack her bag. Gina now is talking
    to the camera and saying how she felt backed into a corner while Chris degraded
    her values. Exactly what John did with Angela..berating her in front of his children...
    asking her if she was a Muslim. CLEARLY YOU BOTH WANT TO INTERPET THAT SCENE TO
    MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SHE WAS THROWN OUT WHEN IF FACT GINA WAS JUST GIVEN AN OPTION.....
    AND THE COWARD TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT. And yes Cheryl, I'm very open minded with
    a sense of humor... AND I'm outrageously generous.... SO, would you care for some
    cool aid as well? Straight up...or on the rocks?

    bill of rights and family dinners. The two husbands on the show were total dicks,
    especially when the book of leviticus came out, come on there is a reason why
    the old testament isn't practiced by most modern christians. He told her she deserved
    to be put to death for being gay, asshole.

  content: Pretty narrow minded view right there, yes ABC wouldnt show the whole show.
    However, they did show the other family had issues as well, but i bet they were
    pissed on how the Loudons reacted to the show. However they spin the show, one
    fact remains the Loudons decided to leave and lawyer up, for what? Pretty lame,
    thought Gina made a couple decent points as well as some bad ones. Her husband
    on the other hand clearly tried to use the show as a channel for his political/religious
    beliefs, come on he told that poor lady she deserved to die. Even Rush wouldn't
    of said that, his show yesterday he claimed no one wishes harm on homosexuals
    or deny them benefits, just the word marriage.

    lawyer up, for looking a little bad on tv, who cares. Looks worse that they chickened

  content: Nice editing of that clip Bill Hennessy. Why not show the whole conversation??
    Because AS USUAL you're trying to manipulate the truth.  Chris did NOT elbow Ashley....
    he flinched away from her. Not the best response to her trying to calm him down....
    BUT HE CLEARLY DID NOT HIT HER as you claim. Again...another lie. Jesus is gonna
    be very disappointed in you if you keep all this sinning up. How do you sleep
    at night?

  content: "I do admire Gina and John for sticking their \"necks\" out on the line
    like this, but did they really accomplish what they were hoping for by using the
    vehicle of liberal television media?  It's like trying to make your case as a
    conservative while participating in a very liberal minded activity of \"wife swapping.\"
    \ Not a good example to begin with.  They also came on the show hoping to show
    what the tea party is not, but actually the media worked against them (as would
    be expected).\r\n\r\nGina admitted in the above video that she could be wrong,
    and I have to agree with her, that it was not the best VENUE to reach out to the
    \"other side.\"  It only came across looking like they were being judgmental,
    which does not promote an open debate and actually supports the accusations made
    by their opponents.  My suggestion?  Start a television talk show which invites
    people from both sides of an issue and hold an open debate.  Get tea party activists
    to join a debate panel so the public will soon understand why we think the way
    we do.  Just my two cents."

<p>Our old friends John and Gina Loudon appear on ABC&rsquo;s <em>Celebrity Wife Swap</em> this Thursday, March 28.</p>
<p>A lot of my friends have asked &ldquo;what were they thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Gina explains what they were thinking:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CMhninWPW28" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>My Take</p>
<p>The Loudons took a big gamble. It&rsquo;s about time someone did.</p>
<p>Gina is dead on. As <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/21/we-need-a-stronger-third-eye/">I&rsquo;ve been saying for awhile</a>, we have to <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/07/why-being-wrong-can-be-the-best-policy/">break out of our affinity bubbles</a>. That means going to places we might not be accepted.</p>
<p>Want to stick to your affinity bubble? Then don&rsquo;t bitch when the Democrats dominate the 2014 and 2016 elections, when libertarianism or conservatism or however you brand yourself is a tiny little subset of politics that matters to no one.</p>
