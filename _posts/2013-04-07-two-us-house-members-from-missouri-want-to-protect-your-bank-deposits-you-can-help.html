<p>&ldquo;Over my dead body.&rdquo;<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ann_Wagner_t670.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="Ann_Wagner_t670" alt="Ann_Wagner_t670" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ann_Wagner_t670_thumb.jpg" width="492" height="387" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Rep. Ann Wagner&rsquo;s (R-MO) described her opposition to any attempts by the US government to seize retirement accounts or bank deposits.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full quote: &ldquo;I am solidly behind this resolution and over my dead body will the USG ever raid our personal savings or retirement accts!!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Ann, for that unequivocal statement on the matter. </strong></p>
<h4>Billy Long&rsquo;s HR 129 To Protect Retirement Income and Bank Deposits</h4>
<p>And thanks to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/289213-cyprus-banking-crisis-inspires-house-resolution-against-raiding-savings-accounts" target="_blank">Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) for introducing House Resolution 129</a> (HR-129). Here&rsquo;s what Long said of the bill, via The Hill:</p>
<blockquote><p>The government should not tax people's private savings accounts, which they have already paid taxes on, especially for the purpose of funding more bailouts. I was shocked by the news that some countries might be considering these kinds of taxes, and I think Congress should say that this kind of tax won't happen in America.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that a member of Congress would even have to say that, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<h4>Obama&rsquo;s Budget Calls for Caps on Retirement Income</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-04-06/obama-proposes-retirement-account-limit-first-wealth-tax-salvo" target="_blank">Obama Administration wants to cap retirement savings at $205,000 a year</a>. In other words, Obama believes no one should make more than $205,000 a year in retirement. <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/april_2013/55_think_most_rich_people_earned_their_money_through_hard_work" target="_blank">No one, no matter how hard they worked</a>, whether they invented the personal computer or the world&rsquo;s largest social network, should enjoy the fruits of their retirement. From ZeroHedge.com:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama plans to set a limit of how much one can spend per year on retirement through tax-preferred retirement plans. As it turns out, <strong>according to the Obama administration it is only fair to spend a total of $205,000 in nominal dollars per year on retirement, but not more</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Tax-Consuming Federal Retirees Exempt</h4>
<p>Except maybe retired federal workers.</p>
<p>According to USAToday, <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/retirement/story/2012-07-19/federal-pensions-in-excess-of-100-thousand/57059716/1" target="_blank">at least six retired federal workers make over $200,000 a year</a>, siphoned from taxpayers. Another 2,100 make more than $100,000 in retirement.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some 1.2% of federal retirees collect six-figure pensions. By comparison, 0.1% of military retirees collect as much. The <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/New+York+State">New York State</a> and Local Retirement System pays 0.2% of its retirees pensions of $100,000 or more. The<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Places,+Geography/States,+Territories,+Provinces,+Islands/U.S.+States/New+Jersey">New Jersey</a> retirement system pays 0.4% of retirees that much. Comparable private figures aren't available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone who said of Cyprus, &ldquo;this couldn&rsquo;t happen in America,&rdquo; was wrong. Obama&rsquo;s already planning it.</p>
<h4>Here&rsquo;s What You Can Do</h4>
<p>First, please contact Billy Long and Ann Wagner and thank them for defending your retirement and bank savings. Politicians rarely hear &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; from constituents when they do the right thing. They are people, after all. <a href="http://www.safeandcivilschools.com/research/references/positive-feedback-ratio-of-interactions.php" target="_blank">Positive feedback works</a>, and <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/08/here-are-the-things-that-are-proven-to-make-y/" target="_blank">expressing gratitude will make your life better</a>.</p>
<p>Next, encourage your members of Congress to fight Obama&rsquo;s money grab. His entire budget is study in media-manipulation and wealth destruction.</p>
<p>Finally, forward this post 3 friends who live in Missouri and ask them to thank Billy and Ann, too. Try a snail-mail letter or phone call instead of an email if you really want to stand out.</p>
