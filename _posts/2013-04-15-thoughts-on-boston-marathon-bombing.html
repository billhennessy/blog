<h4>. . . What Your Definition of Terrorism Is</h4>
<p>I heard a lot of people giving their opinions of what constitutes &ldquo;terrorism.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s the United States Code:</p>
<blockquote><p>Definitions ... the term 'terrorism' means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stick with that one. To be terrorism, all of these five elements must be present. You can use it as a checklist:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="390">Premeditated</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="390">Politically Motivated</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="390">Violent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="390">Perpetrated against noncombatant targets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="390">By subnational groups or clandestine agents</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Two bombs don&rsquo;t make it terrorism, and no bombs don&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not.<br />
<hr /></p>
<h4>The Real Tragedy Was Apparently in Hollywood</h4>
<p>With everybody focusing on the victims in Boston, few took time to pray for the other victims. I&rsquo;m speaking, of course, of the B-List celebrities compelled to inform the world via Twitter how the events in Boston ruined their days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice of the pretty people to acknowledge terrible events. It would be nicer, though, if they could do so without begging for sympathy over how bad they feel. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about all celebrities. Some, like Ben Affleck, focused on the people of Boston, mentioning himself only in the context of conveying love to the people back home. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to know what to say, but &ldquo;this really screwed up my day&rdquo; just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<hr />
<h4>I See Good People. They&rsquo;re Everywhere</h4>
<p>As always, the positive stories trump the negative ones. I don&rsquo;t know how many people were involved in perpetrating this evil, but <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/inspiring-images-from-boston-2013-4" target="_blank">already 11 12 acts of selfless heroics have hit the news</a>. Hundreds of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AoXVKFw1Uci5dFNpRGdWd2pXZTN4a3Fza0VhVTRVaGc&amp;output=html&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;buffer_share=25647" target="_blank">Bostonians opened their homes to anyone</a> who needs them, for instance.</p>
<p>People are good and can be trusted to do the right things when called upon. Some cannot, but they are few. </p>
<p>Seek out the stories of good. Read five positive stories for every negative you read. </p>
<hr />
<h4>Motives Matter</h4>
<p>Motives matter, as does logic.</p>
<p>Someone name Chance Tate tweeted </p>
<blockquote><p>I am so ashamed that "Saudi" and "Muslim" are trending. You didn't see "white" or "Christian" trending, after sandy hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comment is logically flawed.</p>
<p>Recent history shows that Islam is a motive in many terrorist attacks, but no one claims that Adam Lanza&rsquo;s motive was to kill the enemies of Christianity. Or whiteness. Lanza&rsquo;s motive was apparently bat-shit craziness. So was Loughner&rsquo;s. And James Holmes in Aurora, Colorado. </p>
<p>Motives matter, and the COEXIST bumper sticker on his Prius doesn&rsquo;t absolve Mr. Tate of the need to think beyond his own prejudices. It&rsquo;s people like him who encourage terrorists to kill and kill again.</p>
