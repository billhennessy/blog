<p>David Hanneberry lost the love of his life in the capture of Suspect Two&mdash;his boat.</p>
<p>@ColorMeRed inspired the idea of <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/buy-hanneberry-a-boat" target="_blank">buying him a new one</a>. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/buy-hanneberry-a-boat" target="_blank">GoFundMe account to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund a new boat for Mr. Hanneberry</a>. C&rsquo;mon, folks, this guy&rsquo;s a hero.&nbsp; He discovered Tsarnaev in his boat and called the cops. He had the courage to lift the canvas and verify that the bastard was in in there. </p>
<p>And I know the boat meant a lot to him. His stepson told Greta Van Susteren that, next to his wife, that boat was David&rsquo;s greatest love.&nbsp; The stepson also praised Mr. Hanneberry, telling me he&rsquo;s a really good guy.</p>
<p>You can pledge whatever you can afford, and every dollar helps.&nbsp; If we don&rsquo;t meet our goal of 30K in 30 Days, you won&rsquo;t owe a penny.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait. Let&rsquo;s get the momentum going.&nbsp; Donate today and tell 3 friends to donate, too. </p>
