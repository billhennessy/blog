<h3>Get into the spirit of &lsquo;76 with a great live musical</h3>
<p>You probably didn&rsquo;t know that I was a theatre guy in high school and college. In fact, I was a theatre <a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1776-poster.jpg"><img title="1776-poster" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="1776-poster" align="right" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1776-poster_thumb.jpg" width="364" height="484"></a>major for a couple of years. I think the right&rsquo;s neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://insighttheatrecompany.com/" target="_blank">1776, the musical</a>, and a great St. Louis teacher and leader, Jim Leibrecht, is part of the show.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s his summary of this play:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>I just wanted to let you know that the production of <b><i><u>1776 </u></i></b>opens at Insight Theatre a week from Wednesday, June 26.&nbsp; It runs for 10 of the next 12 days, dark on July 1 and 4.&nbsp; Curtain is at 8:00, 2:00 on Sunday&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Theatre is on the campus of Nerinx Hall High School.

<p><u></u><u></u>
<p>I think you all know that I am now one to &ldquo;enthuse&rdquo; without justification.&nbsp; Well, I am about to &ldquo;ENTHUSE&rdquo; enthusiastically.<u></u><u></u>
<p><u></u><u></u>
<p><strong>I have to tell you that this is going to be an extraordinary production</strong>.&nbsp; The cast of 20+ is wonderfully talented as actors and as vocalists, and experienced and professional all.&nbsp; From the leads through the delegates to the entire company, <strong>the vocal quality is &ldquo;awesome&rdquo;</strong>.&nbsp; Voices are very rich and full, and the characters created are engrossing.&nbsp; (I portray Scottish delegate of Delaware, Thomas McKean, he of the robust and florid personality and voice).&nbsp; This is definitely one of the most exhilarating casts I have ever had the privilege and joy of being part of.&nbsp; Each one&rsquo;s abilities help one to enrich and flesh out one&rsquo;s own performance, which means it is a total company and ensemble presentation&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that.&nbsp;&nbsp; But all that is so much more wonderful because the libretto and music of the show are just great.&nbsp; <strong>The book is great writing</strong>; the music fully reflective of the characters, the situation.&nbsp; It is just a wonderful musical.&nbsp; AND the miraculous birth of our Declaration and birth is both confounding and inspiring.&nbsp; <strong>The show makes one appreciate what July 4 is really about all the more</strong>.<u></u><u></u>
<p><u></u><u></u>
<p>I invite you to come; I encourage you to come.&nbsp; <strong>You will find the production of a level of expertise to match any other you may enjoy in St. Louis this summer</strong>.&nbsp; You will be very glad you took the time and effort to share this theatrical magic with the cast and the production.<u></u><u></u>
<p><u></u><u></u>
<p><strong>You may check on ticket availability, and </strong><a href="http://insighttheatrecompany.com/" target="_blank"><strong>purchase tickets at the Insight Theatre website.</strong></a>&nbsp; Just Google it.&nbsp; The tickets are $25 and $30, depending on reserved seat location.&nbsp; I guarantee you will get much MORE than your money&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; There is a fee charge for purchase online.</p>
