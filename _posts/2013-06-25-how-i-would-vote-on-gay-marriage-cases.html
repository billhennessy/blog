<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. And I&rsquo;m not particularly smart. But that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from writing my opinion.</p>
<p>Rather, I&rsquo;m a libertarian-ish conservative. I like a small central government that protects us from evil people in other countries and delivers mail. And prosecutes people who do great harm across state lines. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court has two big gay marriage cases pending. At issue: </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Do the people of California have the right to define marriage in their state? </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Does the federal government have the power to define marriage in every state?</p>
<p>If I were a Supreme Court justice (stop laughing), here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d rule:</p>
<p>1. Yes, the people of California have the right to define marriage in their state. Prop 8 upheld</p>
<p>2. No, the people never gave the federal government the power to define marriage. DOMA unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s scale back entitlements and reform the tax code so federal tax burdens apply equally to everyone regardless of marital status, sexual preference, or eye color. </p>
