<p>I just finished Level 1 Training with the <a href="https://www.tncsg.org/" target="_blank">Center for Self-Governance</a>. While I have a long way to go to complete the training, I can tell you I needed this. Bad.</p>
<h4>What I Didn&rsquo;t Know I Didn&rsquo;t Know</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I was stupid before. And some of the political action I&rsquo;ve been doing my whole adult life was affective, I learned.</p>
<p>The problem is, I didn&rsquo;t know whether or not it was effective. And I was incredibly inefficient. And I did far more work than I needed to for a given result. And I missed lots of opportunities to have far more influence on legislation than I thought.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t know what I didn&rsquo;t know. Before Level 1 training I had no idea how ignorant I was.</p>
<h4>How Many of These Questions Can You Answer?</h4>
<ol>
<li>What&rsquo;s your school board&rsquo;s election cycle?</li>
<li>When does your county council meet?</li>
<li>How often does your city council meet?</li>
<li>Does a bill &ldquo;die&rdquo; at the end of a legislation session in Missouri?</li>
<li>How many state senators does Missouri have?</li>
<li>Who is your county council member?</li>
<li>Does the St. Louis County Council change all at once, or are elections for the seats staggered like the US Senate?</li>
<li>Who is your State Rep and when is he or she termed out?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/calendar/2014cal.asp" target="_blank">What elections are scheduled for 2014 in Missouri</a>?</li>
<li>What happened to 15,000 Witness forms filed by Missourians last week?</li>
</ol>
<p>I was able to answer a lot of these questions. But not all. Not half. And there are lot of other important questions we should all be able to answer. Like &ldquo;how many votes does it take to win the state rep race in your district?&rdquo;&nbsp; And &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the voter turnout for April elections in your county?&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Playing Whack-a-Mole with Government-Driven Issues Ain&rsquo;t Working</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;re losing ground. In Missouri, in the US. We&rsquo;re all worse off than we were two, four, eight, 30 years ago. You know it in your heart.</p>
<p>We take pride in little victories. Block some tax increase here, slowing Blue Ways there. But we&rsquo;re losing ground, not gaining. We&rsquo;re on the defensive. Maybe we're not&nbsp;dying as fast as we could, but we&rsquo;re not advancing. Which means, eventually, we will lose.</p>
<p>Unless we do something different.</p>
<p>Think about it. When was the last time you felt in control of the agenda? When was the last time a House Rep called <em>you</em> to find out what you&rsquo;d like the General Assembly to work on next session?</p>
<p>Well, they call <a href="http://rockinconservative.com/" target="_blank">Brian Bollmann</a>. People like Brian who&rsquo;ve completed Level 5 training from the Center for Self-governance get calls from school boards, city and county councils, state reps and senators, and members of the US Congress.</p>
<p>Level 5 teams have reversed the relationship of government to people. They&rsquo;ve trained their politicians to obey them instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>Brian and the Cape Tea Party did it by <strong>paying more attention to skills, tactics, and strategies and less attention to the issues the government and the press has trained us to react to</strong>.</p>
<h4>Get Your Training Now</h4>
<p>I am going to complete&nbsp;Level 5 training. That'll require 40 hours of my time, plus about $180 over seven months. But it's more than worth it. I've wasted more time and money on ineffective solutions to America's power distribution problem in the past month alone. I&rsquo;m now&nbsp;part of a team, along with the other 22 people who attended Level 1 training hosted by St. Louis Tea Party Coalition yesterday.</p>
<p>If you missed the Level 1 training, <a href="https://www.tncsg.org/classes/" target="_blank">go to Center for Self-governance&rsquo;s class schedule and sign up now</a>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a level 1 class coming up in Quincy, Illinois.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to travel, but so what? We&rsquo;ve travelled for rallies to Quincy without batting an eye, and this training will do far more to change the course of history than any rally every did or ever will.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me?</p>
<p>A millions people marched on Washington on September 12, 2009, to block Obamacare. Did it block Obamacare?</p>
<p>No. It didn&rsquo;t. And claiming it did makes you and America weaker. It&rsquo;s denial. It&rsquo;s deflating. It&rsquo;s pacifying and it encourages people to keep trying the same failed tactics that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Memphis, TN, an African-America, hard-left Democrat is working with the local Tea Party to advance pro-liberty and fiscally responsible legislation in city hall.&nbsp; Why? Because of the relationship local Tea Partiers developed after committing to self-governance instead of yelling in a park.</p>
<p>Get Level 1 Training Before September 21 when St. Louis Tea Party will host Level 2 training.</p>
