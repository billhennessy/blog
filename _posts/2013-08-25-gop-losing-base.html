<p>Nearly 3 million Americans will die before the next Congress is seated in 2015. How dare Republican elites ask them to die waiting for their freedom.</p>
<p>I was part of twitter conversation Saturday. I retweeted @DanStlMo&rsquo;s tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am no longer a member or supporter of the Republican party. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23toct&amp;src=hash">#toct</a></p>
<p>&mdash; DanStlMo (@DanStlMo) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanStlMo/statuses/371293786778775553">August 24, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To which @5is4grace replied:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whennessy">@whennessy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DanStlMo">@DanStlMo</a> NO! What they want &amp; welcome! Form new narrative for conserv.'s within and cont. fight for the "Renewed Republic Party"</p>
<p>&mdash; 5is4grace (@5is4grace) <a href="https://twitter.com/5is4grace/statuses/371316793706430464">August 24, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whennessy">@whennessy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DanStlMo">@DanStlMo</a> We are our own worst enemy in this! Jees! Get us through 2014! Leaving a party does not improve anything.</p>
<p>&mdash; 5is4grace (@5is4grace) <a href="https://twitter.com/5is4grace/statuses/371317055393255425">August 24, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I understand @5is4grace&rsquo;s concern. Defections will help Democrats and hurt conservatives and lower-case libertarians in the short run. But defections of the base are a really bad sign for the Republicans. People like @DanStlMo are the energy of the GOP. They&rsquo;re the Tea Partiers who got the GOP through 2010. They gave the House back to the Republicans, along with a ton of state legislatures. Without that base, the GOP is done.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, the GOP elites don&rsquo;t want to be &ldquo;renewed.&rdquo; Not by people like Dan and me, anyway. They want to be renewed by big government wealth re-allocators like Chris Christie. For us on the right, well, they&rsquo;d like us to shut up, campaign, donate, and vote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Rush Limbaugh points out in this video, the Republicans are embarrassed by their base.</p>

And Dan&rsquo;s not alone in defecting. <a href="http://t.co/XWYvaZI92X">Sean Hannity warned he&rsquo;ll leave the Republican party if the House caves on Obamacare.</a></p>
<h4>The GOP Can&rsquo;t Win Without Us</h4>
<p>We also &ldquo;renewed&rdquo; the GOP in 2000. And again in 2004.&nbsp;What did they do with it?&nbsp; They grew the government, grew domestic spying programs, created a leviathan DHS. They did everything but return power to the people.</p>
<p>The House has the power to force the president to negotiate.&nbsp;It can block the continuing resolution to fund the government. It&nbsp;can put the heat on&nbsp;Obama and force defunding of Obamacare.</p>
<p>But the House leadership&nbsp;is squishy.&nbsp;Boehner&nbsp;wants to put&nbsp;off the Obamacare battle&nbsp;until the debt ceiling debate. Then he&rsquo;ll put it off until after the election. He&rsquo;s instructed Republicans to avoid town halls.&nbsp;In 2009, at least the Democrats had the balls to show up and face the music.&nbsp;But the Republicans run from their own base.</p>
<h4>Republicans Still Have Time and Weapons to Fight Obamacare</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m not yet with Dan.&nbsp;I&nbsp;still have hope that&nbsp;people will bring enough pressure on House Republicans that they will renew themselves.&nbsp; They have the power, and they always&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>The GOP can&rsquo;t tell its base, though, to wait any longer. Waiting is over. Every minute that ticks by is a minute of a short life lived as a subject to a despotic&nbsp;government and not as <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/08/24/50-years-later-dr-kings-dream-becomes-a-night-terror/">a free man living out our founding creed</a>.</p>
