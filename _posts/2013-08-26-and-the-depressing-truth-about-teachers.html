<p>Samantha. </p>
<p>She's the daughter every parent hopes for. Diligent. Dedicated. Kind to a fault. Smart. Hard working. Loyal. Prettier than she knows. </p>
<p>She gets it from her mother.</p>
<p>She's about to graduate from college and become a teacher. </p>
<p>Like her mom.</p>
<p>She doesn't need a union. </p>
<p>She is a union. </p>
<p>With her mom.</p>
<p>And a million others.</p>
<p>They care. And try. And teach. Or try. </p>
<p>Your kid would be blessed to walk into Sam's classroom one day.</p>
<p>Or her mom's. </p>
<p>But strong unions won't let her teach and care the way God and her mom prepared her to teach and care. The union doesn't care. Except for itself.</p>

<p>Samantha is a listener. </p>
