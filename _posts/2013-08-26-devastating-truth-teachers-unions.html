<p>The stronger the union the weaker the learnin'. &nbsp;According to <a href="http://links.mkt3142.com/servlet/MailView?ms=NjgyMjMzNwS2&amp;r=Mzc4OTg2MTk1S0&amp;j=ODU0MTI0MjkS1&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a>, students learn less in states with stronger teachers' unions.</p>
<blockquote><p>A 1-standard-deviation rise in teachers' union dues per teacher is associated with a 4% fall in student proficiency rates, according to a study of 721 U.S. school districts in 42 states by Johnathan Lott of the University of Chicago Law School and Lawrence W. Kenny of the University of Florida.</p>
<p>Dues support union lobbying, which typically pushes for policies such as blocking merit pay and limiting the Teach for America program. Consequently, <strong>student proficiency is lower in states with stronger teacher unions</strong>, the researchers say.</p></blockquote>
<p>Get that? <strong>Unions use their money to block proven education reforms</strong>. Teachers' unions do not exist to make education better; they exist to make the union more powerful.</p>
<p>Your kids are just the ammunition they use.</p>
