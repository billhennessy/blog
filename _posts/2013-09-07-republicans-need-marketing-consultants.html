  content: Unfortunately the message-malady is accompanied by what must be a pretty
    hefty (and wasteful) investment. I get a huge amount of junk mail from the Republican
    party, individual candidates and various conservative groups, including Tea Party
    Patriots, etc. With the notable exceptions of the Border Sherrifs and OPSEC, most
    of these are repetitive mailings of exactly the same materials. I'd love to work
    with you on a novel messaging strategy - or at least contribute.

    Thanks. I am going to start with basic email checks for common mistakes. Like unmonitored return addresses. (If you won't receive emails from voters as a candidate, you won't respond to constituents as a public servant.)

    I'd live your input. Mind if I send you the draft of the paper?

  content: I have come to believe Republicans are transmitting the message they intend
    voters to hear.  If we want government to act in a different way, it may be time
    for conservatives and independents to create their own message and run their own
    candidates.  I'll take a copy of your draft paper.

<p>I got four emails from Republican candidates today. They all sucked. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made every mistake they made, so I won&rsquo;t beat anyone up over it. </p>
<p>But if conservative candidates want to win elections, they have to become&mdash;or hire&mdash;excellent marketers. </p>
<p>Everybody freaks out about the Democrat advantage in data, analytics, and social. But 80 percent of that gap is good execution of scientifically established marketing principles. </p>
<p>Republicans tend to despise marketing. They reject psychology. And they wonder why they get their butts kicked. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about this stuff in the past few years. I&rsquo;ve seen how one little change can double email open rates and increase click-thrus and forwards by 82 percent. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a way to share this information with candidates I&rsquo;d vote for. (If you think Chris Christie would make a great president, don&rsquo;t bother applying.)</p>
<p>More to follow. </p>
