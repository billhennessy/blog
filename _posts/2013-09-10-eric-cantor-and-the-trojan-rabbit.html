<p>Eric Cantor&rsquo;s latest tactic in the battle to defund Obamacare reminds me of the Trojan Rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/T2PdyxMtiYM" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Business Insider&rsquo;s Josh Barro:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's a strategy predicated on the idea that Republican activists are stupid. Many of them are stupid. But they're not stupid enough to fall for this.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Barro is hard-left, btw.)</p>
<p>From what I can gather, Cantor intends to pass two continuing resolutions out of the House. One funds Obamacare along with some other cuts and increases. The other doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>House Republican leadership hopes the Senate will screw up and pass the wrong one, defunding Obamacare without a shutdown.</p>
<p>Not really. House leadership actually hopes the Senate passes the bill that funds Obamacare because it also funds some Republican favorites.</p>
<p>I have to give the GOP leaders credit for courage. They&rsquo;re begging for really nasty primary fights next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on twitter, Rep. Ann Wagner&rsquo;s spokesperson is arguing nonsense.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whennessy">@whennessy</a> ObamaCare funding is all mandatory spending and the CR is discretionary funding, meaning it would stop less than 1% of the law</p>
<p>&mdash; Patrick Howell (@pchowell01) <a href="https://twitter.com/pchowell01/statuses/377506993084588035">September 10, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="http://heritageaction.com/" target="_blank">Heritage Action for America</a> has to say about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), &ldquo;will incur substantial administrative costs to implement the law&rsquo;s private insurance reforms and its changes to the federal health care programs.&rdquo; And while Obamacare provided $1 billion in mandatory funding when it was first enacted, HHS projects that this is largely spent. According to CRS, Obamacare&rsquo;s, &ldquo;administrative costs will have to be funded through annual discretionary appropriations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, discretionary spending bills routinely contain provisions making changes to mandatory spending, and there is no reason that the CR could not have. Unfortunately, the House-passed CR contained no specific language precluding HHS and IRS from funding implementation, and as a result, implementation will go forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>House leaders don&rsquo;t want to fight. They want to pass the buck, as Patrick Howell admits:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whennessy">@whennessy</a> How many "moderate" Democrats would be forced to oppose ObamaCare. The battle is in the Senate, and we should be calling Senators</p>
<p>&mdash; Patrick Howell (@pchowell01) <a href="https://twitter.com/pchowell01/statuses/377535395862310912">September 10, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, &ldquo;give up.&rdquo; Stop calling Ann Wagner&rsquo;s office. Call Roy Blunt, instead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for calling Blunt, but Patrick&rsquo;s tweets do not demonstrate leadership; they perpetuate finger-pointing.</p>
