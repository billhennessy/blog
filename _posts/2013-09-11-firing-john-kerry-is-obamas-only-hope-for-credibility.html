<p>John Kerry isn&rsquo;t fit for Secretary of State, and the whole world knows it.</p>
<p>If Obama every had a strategy for Syria, John Kerry destroyed it in a matter of minutes Monday. </p>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fstory%2F2013%2F09%2Fsyria-john-kerry-unbelievably-small-comment-96461.html%3Fml%3Dal_1&amp;ei=L90vUojdNIfyrAG84ICoAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOfXY5hEwuyCprqsB_LJqWaX-uZg&amp;sig2=Bh4-DQ_jR1ufnPv5tpXp3Q" target="_blank">Kerry said any American response to unspeakable humanitarian crisis in Syria would be &ldquo;unbelievably small.&rdquo;</a> Man, you know that fired up the Marines floating off the coast of Syria. I can see them, Mae Wests on, ready to charge the beach, hearing that dreadful command: &ldquo;Fix bottle rockets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with the entire internet still laughing at his first gaffe of the day, Kerry went further. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CGcQFjAH&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rushlimbaugh.com%2Fdaily%2F2013%2F09%2F09%2Fjohn_kerry_gives_assad_one_week_to_give_up_or_face_an_unbelievably_small_attack&amp;ei=r90vUvn3A4iUqwHR_IHIBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMZdv4Z4e-iph-LvHN2XVmn4jS1A&amp;sig2=RjO86YFNXBjCXSK9oQhhVA" target="_blank">He said Syrian president Bashar al Assad had one week to surrender his chemical and biological weapons</a>. </p>
<p>Immediately, the State Department contradicted Kerry. But it can&rsquo;t. The State Department reports to John Kerry. Only the President can overrule a diplomatic offer from the Secretary of State. </p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Obama-Kerry.jpg"><img title="Obama-Kerry" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="Obama-Kerry" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Obama-Kerry_thumb.jpg" width="472" height="270"></a></p>
<p>But it was too late, and the Russians know their protocol. </p>
<p>Putin offered to oversee the inspections and control of Syria&rsquo;s biological and chemical weapons. Then the White House tried to claim responsibility for the maneuver. The progressive press doctored up stories claiming this weapons surrender was in the works weeks ago. </p>
<p>The trouble is, everyone watched Obama&rsquo;s Keystone Cop chief drooling through diplomatic hell. The truth was out there and obvious and disturbing. <a href="http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/foxs-shep-smith-just-got-played-russians/" target="_blank">Shep Smith put it best: &ldquo;we just got played</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barack Obama appointed Kerry to a very important job. And John Kerry has proven himself perfectly capable of accidentally launching World War III. </p>
<p>Obama owes himself, the United States, and the world relief from the risk posed by Kerry&rsquo;s incompetence. </p>
<p>Until our Secretary of State is a sober adult, we have no business considering military action. </p>
