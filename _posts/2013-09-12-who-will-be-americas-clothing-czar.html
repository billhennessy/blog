<p>Are you ready for America&rsquo;s first Clothing Czar?</p>
<p>According to RightQuestion.org, this person, &ldquo;will decide what you will wear every day for the<br />
next four years.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Goth, what if the Czar disallows Goth? What if he&rsquo;s an 80s fan and orders collars up?</p>
<p>What other questions do you have for the new Clothing Czar?</p>
<p>The good news: you can vote for the Clothing Czar of your choice.</p>
<p>What questions would you ask?</p>
<hr />
<p>In the Right Question Institute&rsquo;s exercise to get young people to vote, the facilitator lets them know there is no Clothing Czar.</p>
<p>But there is a President. And Congress. And, together, they appoint judges.</p>
<p>And in Missouri, there&rsquo;s a governor and legislature and judges on the ballot.</p>
<p>And these real offices make decisions about your life every day. Maybe they&rsquo;re not as personal and immediate as What Not To Wear. But the decisions government makes for you are far more important.</p>
<p>The government is about to decide very personal things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>And the NSA listens to your phone calls, reads your emails, and, potentially, spies into your bathroom window with a drone.</p>
<p>So, while the Right Question Institutes wants to you write down as many questions as you can about the fictitious Clothing Czar, I want you to consider just one question:</p>
<p>Why would you let anyone make those decisions for you?</p>
<p>I understand that in our representative system, we elect people to handle some details we don&rsquo;t want to bother with. But the list above includes personal life decisions, not general, boring government activity.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to own your own life instead of renting the one some bureaucrat chooses for you?</p>
<p>In the end, that&rsquo;s the only reason I dabble in politics and self-governance. I want to own my own life, and I want everyone else to be free to own theirs, too.</p>
<p>If you want to own your own life, say so in the comments. It&rsquo;s an important question. Your life, literally, depends on your answer.</p>
