<p>I had no idea this was coming when I wrote <a title="What Happens When You Count Your Blessings?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/09/18/what-happens-when-you-count-your-blessings/">my blog post on gratitude</a> at midnight.</p>
<p>From Heritage Action for America:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="top">This morning, <strong>House leaders announced they would pass a continuing resolution that funds the government but defunds Obamacare</strong> this week.</p>
<p>In many ways, today&rsquo;s announcement represents &ldquo;a victory&hellip;for the GOP&rsquo;s conservative wing and its tea-party allies.&rdquo; &nbsp;(<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323342404579081560684879076.html#printMode" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>) &nbsp;However, it also represents a victory for the tens of thousands of workers who have seen their hours cut thanks to Obamacare and to the patients searching for new doctors.</p>
<p>It is also a reaffirmation that Americans outside of Washington can have an impact on the legislative process.<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/358656/movement-strikes-back-robert-costa" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/358656/movement-strikes-back-robert-costa" target="_blank">According to National Review&rsquo;s Robert Costa</a>, Heritage Action&rsquo;s nine-city defund Obamacare tour &ldquo;drew huge crowds and inspired backers across the country to ask their representatives about where they stood. &nbsp;&lsquo;A lot of members were put in a corner,&rsquo; says a House Republican insider. &nbsp;&lsquo;They were caught by surprise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to claim credit, of course. I really do. Not for advocacy or fighting hard. Most people in this fight work a lot harder than I do. For instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/HeritageActMO" target="_blank">Ben Evans of Heritage Action</a> was actually on that defund Obamacare tour.</p>
<p>I want to claim credit for saying "thank you" for small wins. I want to think that my little appreciation to Ann Wagner for signing the Graves Bill made a difference.</p>
<p>And it did make a difference. Not to House leadership, but to me. My life became a little better because I recognized a small win and focused less on the big loss I expected.</p>
<p>I don't always follow my own advice. For weeks I'll religiously write down three things that I'm grateful for every day. Then I stop.</p>
<p>I have no idea why I stop, but I know what happens when I do: the little wins stop, too.</p>
<p>So, please, take a moment to use the tweet button or the facebook button or the linkedin button on this post to thank the House Republican leadership for deciding to fight with us. Thank @HeritageActMo, too. Do it for yourself because expressing gratitude will make you happier and improve your relationships. Even your relationship with Congress.</p>
