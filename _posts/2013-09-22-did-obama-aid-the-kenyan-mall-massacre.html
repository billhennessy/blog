<p>I never thought I'd have to ask.</p>
<p>In Nairobi, Kenya, al Qaeda terrorists stormed an upscale mall yesterday to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/witness-kenya-mall-attackers-told-muslims-to-leave-non-muslims-would-be-targeted/2013/09/21/cc3821da-22bb-11e3-ad1a-1a919f2ed890_story.html" target="_blank">kill all the Christians</a>.So far, 59 are dead and at least 175 wounded. Another 30 or so hostages remain inside with the terrorists.Kenyan police are hunting the terrorists and attempting to free the hostages.</p>
<p>The USA, surely, is on the side of the Kenyan authorities. Right?</p>
<p>Well, last week, President <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/barack-obama-engages-criminal-activity-waives-ban-arming-terrorists/" target="_blank">Obama waived (aka, violated) a US law that prohibited the arming of terrorists</a> and terrorist-linked groups.</p>
<p>The terrorist-linked group Obama authorized himself to arm? al Qaeda, of course.</p>
<p>Just 12 year after 9-11, it seems ridiculous to ask whose side we're on, but so much about the Obama administration is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Now that we're allied with al Qaeda in Syria, why wouldn't Obama ally himself with al Qaeda in Kenya?</p>
<p>The questions get more disturbing. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/crime/item/15533-obama-s-fast-and-furious-gun-running-scandal-grows" target="_blank">Remember Fast and Furious</a>? Our Attorney General Eric Holder gave weapons to Mexican drug gangs. The idea seemed to be that the drug gangs would commit atrocities, which they did, we'd investigate, which we did, and find weapons made and bought in the USA, which we did. That would inspire Americans to rise up and demand an end to the Second Amendment--which we didn't.</p>
<p>While US arms haven't had time to make it from the US to Syria to Kenya, it's still possible that Obama's arms-for-terrorists waiver contributed to the massacre in Nairobi. With US weapons headed to al Qaeda in Syria, there's opportunity to use existing weapons murdering Christians in Kenya.</p>
<p>My scenario might be unlikely, but it's far from ridiculous. What's ridiculous is that we've reached a bizarre inflection point in American history where we can legitimately wonder if our President is arming people who will almost certainly use those weapons against us. After all, back in 2008, Obama supported a Kenyan terrorist cell in its war against Christians:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Sen. Barack Obama has continued to support Kenya&rsquo;s Raila Odinga, even after Odinga has been blamed for inciting tribal violence and slaughtering Christians<br />

<p>So far, the White House remains silent on the Kenyan Mall Massacre. I guess you have to be very careful about how you put it to the American people that their tax dollars are indirectly aiding genocide of Christians in the President's adopted home country.</p>
