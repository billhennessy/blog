<p>Email is one of the cheapest, most effective tools political campaigns have. And the Democrats do pretty well. In fact, major marketing companies actually learned some things from Obama's 2012 campaign.</p>
<p>But Republicans seem to think simply sending out an email is enough.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>If you're running for office, you need to know the science of email.</p>
<p>That's why I wrote this 11-page report: 9 Email Marketing Mistakes I Made So You Don't Have To.</p>
<p>It's free if you're a conservative or libertarian candidate in Missouri.</p>
<p>Inside you'll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 mistakes I've made and learned from</li>
<li>The science behind emails that get opened and acted on</li>
<li>The secrets of killer subject lines</li>
<li>How to drive up your click-thru rates</li>
<li>A printable checklist to use on every email you send</li>
<li>More</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is free.</p>
<p>With the 2014 election season starting now, you can't afford to wait a day to download and read this report.</p>
