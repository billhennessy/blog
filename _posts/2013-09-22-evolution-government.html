  content: Thanks Bill for a great contrast in private and public governments.  Unfortunately
    we have become slaves of the public government now in power.  Before it is too
    late We the People must rise up and challenge what they are doing,  We are currently
    on the path to a communist nation.

  content: "Actually, our government FEELS more like a private government today. It
    behaves like one. It builds massive spy agencies to intimidate and control the
    people. I will expand on this later in the week. I think that's what you might
    be feeling, too. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read and comment. Much appreciated."

  content: "Yeah, I think our government might have transitioned to quasi-private
    venture in 2008.  I'll write more on this later in the week. \n\nThink about this:
    if my contrast is accurate, which government would build the NSA to spy on and
    surreptitiously prosecute and control its citizens?"
