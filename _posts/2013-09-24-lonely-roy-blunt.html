  content: Those of us attending St. Louis CPAC need to remember how Roy Blunt voted
    on cloture and let him know how we feel when he takes the stage.

<p>Imagine how isolated Roy Blunt must feel.</p>
<p>Senator Blunt is a party man. He believes in following leadership. He doesn&rsquo;t rock the boat.</p>
<p>And his leader, Senate Minority Leader <a title="Mitch McConnell Vows To Help Harry Reid Fund Obamacare" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/09/23/mitch-mcconnell-vows-help-harry-reid-fund-obamacare/" target="_blank">Slick Mitch McConnell, has decided to help Harry Reid get the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture on the continuing resolution</a>. Once debate closes (via cloture), Reid will strip the House&rsquo;s defund language from the bill and pass it.</p>
<p><strong>Senate Republican leadership wants defund language stripped.</strong></p>
<p>But if Roy Blunt doesn&rsquo;t do everything in his power to stop Obamacare&mdash;including joining Ted Cruz&rsquo;s filibuster&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be a pariah in Missouri.</p>
<p>Think about it. Missouri:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passed Proposition C</li>
<li>Blocked Obamacare Exchanges in the Missouri Senate</li>
<li>Blocked Medicaid Expansion</li>
<li>Blocked Obamacare Exchanges a second time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Missourians want nothing to do with the law that will destroy America&rsquo;s world class healthcare system</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want bold leadership like we see from Cruz, Paul, Lee, and Rubio on this issue.</li>
<li>We want a Senator who will stand against funding Obamacare&mdash;the way our House Republicans stood against it last week.</li>
<li>We want to cheer Roy Blunt next Saturday at CPAC St. Louis.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t want to have to boo him off the stage.</li>
<li>We want him to rise up and lead this fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>But Senator Blunt&rsquo;s a party man.</p>
<p>To join our fight, to fight with us against funding Obamacare, Blunt would have to break from his habit. A habit of avoiding risk. A habit of following orders.</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t be easy.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to make it easier for him.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/100369-gop-moves-to-repeal-healthcare-law" target="_blank">Blunt joined a group of House Republicans to repeal the law in 2010</a>. But that effort had no consequences. Taking a stand today does entail consequences.</p>
<p><strong>So is Senator Blunt the kind of man who takes a stand only when there's no risk?</strong></p>
<p>That's not leadership. It reminds me of a line from&nbsp;<em>Catcher in the Rye</em>. &nbsp;Something about "getting tough with myself in the mirror."</p>
<p>No, I can't make this battle easy for a man who asked to be our Senator. Remember, Rep. Roy Blunt asked to be our Senator in 2010--during the heat of the Obamacare battle.</p>
<p>I will ask him two questions. I hope he will answer in the comments on this blog.</p>
<p>Senator Blunt:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Do you still believe, as you said in 2010, that Obamacare is the more dangerous law you&rsquo;ve ever seen?</li>
<li>Do you believe Obamacare will destroy the American healthcare system?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to those questions&mdash;which would be consistent with your past statements&mdash;how can you not put your career on the line to stop it?</p>
<p>Your state, your country, and your legacy depend on how you answer those questions, Senator.</p>
<p>Choose wisely. We'll see you Saturday morning.</p>
