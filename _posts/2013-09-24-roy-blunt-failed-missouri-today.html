    a Missourian, <strong>I am embarrassed at your failure to take action against
    Obamacare. </strong>\r\n\r\nI know what you said. <strong>Words are cheap.</strong>
    \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, words are all you've offered against Obamacare so far.
    If you won't put your political capital on the line, you're no leader, no statesman.
    \r\n\r\n<strong>It's time to man up</strong> and take bold action against the
    most dangerous assault on freedom in our lives, Senator.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nBill
    Hennessy</blockquote>\r\n\r\n"

  content: "Great piece Bill.  The case you made is pretty clear and straight forward.
    \ No other Senator(s) in Washington had a clearer message sent to them by their
    constituents than the two Senators of Missouri.  \r\n\r\nSenator Blunt's vote
    is an example of the failure of a system set up for citizen representation.  Senators
    Blunt and McCaskill were elected to represent the people; not for the people to
    follow what the Senators represent."

    power I lent him in 2016."

  content: 'Here is the note I sent to Senator''s McConnell and Blunt: Dear Senator,
    I am writing in the hopes to change your mind and join Ted Cruz and Mike Lee in
    their efforts to defund Obamacare. The Republicans do not have the votes in the
    Senate, but do have the votes to filibuster the bill. If you vote for cloture
    is the same as voting to fund Obamacare, because Harry Reid will strip the defunding
    mechanism from the bill. We need to stand on principle. Now is the time to fight.
    There is overwhelming opposition to Obamacare. Even the Unions are opposed to
    it now. Why not solicit the help from the Unions to put pressure on the Democrats?
    The Obama Regime is going to blame the Republicans anyway, so why not do the right
    thing and get the Republicans to band together to end Obamacare. You have to remember
    how it was passed and the resulting wave of Republicans elected in the 2010 election
    as a result. Do not be afraid to shut down the Government. The last time it occurred
    the Republicans picked up two seats in the Senate. As Thomas Paine said, "These
    are the times that try men&rsquo;s souls." Stand fast and stand tall. The people
    are behind you to have this fight. Get with Senators Cruz and Lee and let''s get
    it done. Thanks.'

<p>The Republican primary for US Senate in 2016 will actually be a battle for an empty seat. Roy Blunt effectively abdicated his throne today.</p>
<p>This morning, <a title="How Lonely Is Roy Blunt?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/09/24/lonely-roy-blunt/">I showed where Missouri stands on Obamacare</a>.</p>
<p>I've called, written, and tweeted to Roy Blunt. So have thousands of other Missourians. And so have Americans across the country.</p>
<p><strong>I'm not surprised that Roy Blunt failed to publicly join Ted Cruz's filibuster.</strong>&nbsp;That kind of daring commitment to principle just isn't in his character. He wouldn't get anything out of it.</p>
<p>I am a little shocked that <strong>Blunt became only the third Republican Senator to publicly side with Harry Reid</strong>.</p>
<p>No one should be shocked that Blunt shamefully talked like a weasel about his decision to oppose Ted Cruz's strategy to defund Obamacare. Here, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/24/blunt-opposes-cruzs-defund-obamacare-filibuster/" target="_blank">Blunt plagiarizes his leader, Mitch McConnell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This week, I'll continue that fight by supporting the House-passed continuing resolution, which defunds ObamaCare and keeps the government open without increasing federal spending. I will vote to begin debate on this bill and move to final passage on the House-passed CR.</p></blockquote>
<p>Weasel words. Clever. Slick. Insincere. Weak.</p>
<p>Blunt knows, as do you, that his vote against the final Senate bill is worth less than his promises to do everything in his power to stop Obamacare. I'd have more respect for him if came out and said, "I stick my neck out for nobody."</p>
<p>Instead, Blunt said he would "oppose efforts" by Harry Reid to remove the defunding language from the bill.</p>
<p>Really, Senator? How will you oppose? With a terse statement from the floor? Maybe with some pithy, digging tweets in between calls to happy donors?</p>
<p>Blunt's post-cloture opposition to Reid's efforts will be about as meaningful as my opposition to tomorrow's weather.</p>
<ul>
<li>By voting for cloture, <strong>Roy Blunt will vote to give Harry Reid the power</strong> to strip Obamacare defund language from the continuing resolution.</li>
<li>By voting for cloture, <strong>Roy Blunt will put Obamacare on the fast-track</strong> to wrecking the American healthcare system.</li>
<li>By voting for cloture, <strong>Roy Blunt will never again be able to say, "I did everything in my power</strong> as a citizen and a Senator to stop this monstrosity."</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, along with <a title="Mitch McConnell Vows To Help Harry Reid Fund Obamacare" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/09/23/mitch-mcconnell-vows-help-harry-reid-fund-obamacare/">Mitch McConnell</a> and John Cornyn, Senator Roy Blunt forms a crusty club of warped old men who sit in the Senate and plot ways to increase their own power--even at the expense of yours.</p>
<p><a title="How Lonely Is Roy Blunt?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/09/24/lonely-roy-blunt/">At least, Roy has two friends</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What You Can Do:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tweet this post to @RoyBlunt</li>
<li>If you go to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/169390747/CPAC-St-Louis-Agenda" target="_blank">CPAC St. Louis this Saturday, Blunt takes the stage at 10:02 a.m.</a> Let him know how your feel. Assuming he shows.</li>
<li>Send a thank you note to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-filibuster-defund-obamacare-senate-government-shutdown-2013-9" target="_blank">@SenTedCruz for being the bravest, most principled man in the Senate</a></li>
</ul>
