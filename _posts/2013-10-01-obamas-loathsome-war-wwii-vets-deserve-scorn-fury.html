<p>I'm sure <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2013/10/01/barack-obama-world-war-ii-veterans/" target="_blank">you've all see the reports</a>.</p>
<p>WWII Veterans asked the White House for permission to visit the World War II Memorial in case of a shutdown. The veterans are part of the Honor Flights program that helps aging veterans visit the WWII Memorial.</p>
<p>Even though there's no cost involved, the White House chose to dishonor the veterans' request. It send forth "goons," in Senator Paul's works, to erect barricades around the memorial. The White House posted armed guards to keep the veterans at bay.</p>
<p>A Republican member of the House of Representatives went out and removed a barricade. The veterans flooded in. Some in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Only a contemptible, loathsome snake of a man would use WWII veterans--in their late 80s and 90s--as political pawns in his game of dictator.</p>
<p>This is a man who brags of being a "Constitutional Scholar," then tells the American people that Congress is not allowed to choose what it funds. He knows better; he's lying.</p>
<p>This is a man who brags of being a "Constitutional Scholar," but insists that laws upheld by the Supreme Court can never be altered or abolished. He knows better; he's lying.</p>
<p>Loathsome. Despicable. </p>
<p>Democrats should realize they can reject Obama's reptilian ways without leaving their party. They can, for once, put human decency before party loyalty.</p>
<p>And Republicans should take note. When a leader of our party exposes himself as a poisonous snake, run away.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3073678/posts" target="_blank">WWII Veterans from Toledo, OH, were told they'd be arrested if they attempted to approach the WWII Memorial. </a></p>
<p>The White House is playing with fire, now. And its lost the PR battle. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, A<a href="http://andreaplunkett.com/government-shutdown-threatens-kc-honor-flight/" target="_blank">ndrea Plunkett of Kansas City will escort 90 Missouri WWII Veterans on an Honor Flight to the Memorial</a>. Stay tuned . . . </p>
