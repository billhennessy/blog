<p>When I was three, a cat jumped off the roof of a screened deck onto my back as I was walking up the stairs to the deck. The cat shredded my shirt and turned my back to hamburger.</p>
<p>I'll get back to that.</p>
<p>You know this clich&eacute;: &nbsp;"What goes up must come down."</p>
<p>It's true. Even satellites and space stations crash back to earth. And the long distance probes like Voyager will eventually crash into some planet or start.</p>
<p>What goes up comes down. And it breaks apart on re-entry.</p>
<p>Here's another clich&eacute;: "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."</p>
<p>Also true. Most clich&eacute;s are true. In fact, "clich&eacute;" means "undeniable truth."</p>
<p>I just made that up. I have no idea.</p>
<p>But if a clich&eacute; were totally wrong, it would stop being a clich&eacute;. So clich&eacute;s have some truth in them. Especially about things that go up come down.</p>
<p>With that law of reality in mind, look a this chart from the Federal Reserve:</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Various-025.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13981" alt="US Government Debt" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Various-025.png" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was born in 1963. October 5, to be exact. John F. Kennedy was President and would remain so for another 48 days. US government debt was, more or less, zero.</p>
<p>The debt line rose a bit through 60s, a bit more through 70s, especially during the Carter years. It grew a lot in the 1980s and 1990s, though it took a bit of dive in the late 1990s. Probably because I got out of the Navy in December 1994. &nbsp;I'll take credit for that.</p>
<p>Then, after 9/11, debt skyrocketed. Until 2008.</p>
<p>In 2008, US government debt rose almost vertically. It went straight up. Straight up.</p>
<p>From 1955 to 2001, time moved faster than the debt moved up. Since 2001, debt moved up fast than time moved forward.</p>
<p>Since 2008, debt's rocket so fast time seemed to stand still.</p>
<p>So did the US GDP.</p>
<p>When people like Ted Cruz talk for 20 hours, they're not just talking about Obamacare. And they're not advancing their careers.</p>
<p>They're explaining clich&eacute;s.</p>
<p>What goes up must come down.</p>
<p>The bigger they are, the harder they fall.</p>
<p>Those clich&eacute;s are true. I learned how true the were in 1967 when that white cat jumped off Spook and Bev Rustige's covered deck onto my back. The cat fell about 20 feet. I still remember Bev rubbing alcohol on my back with a cotton ball. It burned like hell. My shirt was ruined. I was crying. Screaming.</p>
<p>Those clich&eacute;s apply to people, countries, and economies. And white cats.</p>
<p>That vertical line won't go horizontal. It'll come back down. &nbsp;At some point, it will fall swiftly back to meet the red line.</p>
<p>Not to be hyperbolic, but when that happens, people will die in big numbers. People will die of disease and starvation. They'll die of violence because government will collapse.</p>
<p>When the blue line meets the red line, Harvard professors won't survive--people with guns and food will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what Ted Cruz and Mike Lee were talking about. They didn't use scary scenarios like people dying by the millions or white cats clawing the shit out of a 3-year-old's back, but that's what they were talking about.</p>
<p>No, we didn't win the shutdown. But no one noticed the shutdown. It didn't really affect anyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-10-18/lacy-hunt-warns-federal-reserve-policy-failures-are-mounting" target="_blank">When the blue line crashes, everyone will shudder</a>. And many will die.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.quora.com/Tea-Party-politics/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-Tea-Party-Republican">that's why the Tea Party exists</a>.</p>
