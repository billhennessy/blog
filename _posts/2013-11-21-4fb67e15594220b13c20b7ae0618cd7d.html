<p>Hello,</p>
<p>How has your week been? My name is Lauren Sharsta and I am located in Southern California.</p>
<p>I am shedding light on which federal agencies were in operation during the recent US government shutdown. After looking over your site I know your readers will find interest in an infographic called How Important Is Each Federal Agency? Your readers will learn to what extent various federal agencies were in operation during the recent shutdown and therefore which agencies are viewed as most important.</p>
<p>You can view the infographic at this link: http://www.masters-in-accounting.org/federal-agencies/<br />
The graphic can be easily posted to your site by using the listed embed code.</p>
<p>Feel free to share this infographic that relates to Americans and citizens across the globe. And thank you for educating your readers on this subject.</p>
<p>Lauren<br />
