<p>Do you realize that's been nearly five years since <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2009/02/22/st-louis-tea-party/">I wrote this post</a>? Realizing how time's flown since 2009, I've been a little nostalgic this weekend.</p>
<p>I looked through some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcx81Rb7Y7iVOGbQGE7oGSA">Darin Morley's excellent videos on YouTube</a>.I searched "St. Louis Tea Party" on duckduckgo.com.</p>
<p>Have you thought about what's happened?</p>
<p>While Russ Carnahan survived Ed Martin's remarkable challenge in 2010, Russ is no longer in Congress, and Ed is chairman of Missouri's Republican Party.</p>
<p>While Obamacare passed and survived a Supreme Court challenge, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/20/how-low-can-go-obama-poll-numbers-drop-again/">most Americans are now openly hostile to both the law and its author</a>.</p>
<p>While the Tea Party movement has fewer supporters, <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stocks/poll-americans-distrust-of-government-high.html/?a=viewall">its key principle--questioning government--is surging</a>.</p>
<p>While most young voters voted Democrat in 2012, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/04/to-win-millenials-the-gop-needs-to-embrace-its-inner-libertarian.html">the Millennial generation is quickly becoming the most libertarian generation since Jefferson's</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we in Missouri and Illinois played a proportionally small role in those accomplishments. Still, we made things happen. We shook stuff up.</p>
<p>So what was our high water mark? What event or protest or demonstration was the one to hang our hats on? Comments are open. In a few days, I'll let you know my candidate. It might surprise you.</p>
