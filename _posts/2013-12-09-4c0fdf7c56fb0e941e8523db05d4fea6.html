<p>I am a conservative political consultant. I worked for Marijuana Policy Project to help pass Amendment 64 in Colorado to regulate marijuana like alcohol, and I've lobbied for similar reforms in other states. I'm interested in mobilizing conservatives and Republicans to support marijuana legalization and better drug policy. Are you available to talk about the possibility of bringing together like-minds at CPAC 2014 for a sponsorship-package? This could include an exhibitor's booth, a documentary screening/debate/discussion/book signing etc.<br />
CPAC is really just something to build off of, because my long-term goal is to raise money for a PAC and support candidates with sensible drug policy positions and support local initiatives.<br />
Best,<br />
