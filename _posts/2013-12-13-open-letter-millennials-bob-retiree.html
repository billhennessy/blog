<p>Submitted by Bob, the retiree:</p>
<p>To the Millennials&nbsp;of America,</p>
<p>All you sniveling, whining, crybaby Millennials&nbsp;need to quit your complaining and get signed up with Obamacare as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t care what it costs you. I am retired now and drawing my Social Security and will sign up for Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and any other Social program available, as soon as I can qualify. I'm entitled, you know!</p>
<p>We need you bunch of sniveling crybabies to get on board so you can pay for these programs. How else am I going to be able to siphon off your wealth? You do believe in wealth redistribution don&rsquo;t you? You don&rsquo;t deserve all that wealth you have now or will earn in the future. It&rsquo;s your obligation to share it with us. We're entitled to some of it.</p>
<p>Quit griping, quit sniveling, quit complaining and get signed up now, you hear! That&rsquo;s an order.</p>
<p>Bob, The Retiree</p>
