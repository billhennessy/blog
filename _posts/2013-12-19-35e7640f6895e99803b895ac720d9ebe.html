<p>Bill - a couple of months ago at a Tea Party After Party, I mentioned that I was looking for candidates for the state representative districts in St. Louis City.  You mentioned that you might know someone that may be interested in running.  Could you forward me that person's name and contact information?  Thanks.  Michael Chance, Republican Committeeman, 8th Ward, St. Louis City.<br />
