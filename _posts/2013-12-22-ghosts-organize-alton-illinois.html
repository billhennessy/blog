<p>Alton, Illinois &mdash; Spirits of the dead in the river city of Alton, Illinois, voted last night to organize as a union affiliated with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).</p>
<p>Everett Johnson, a lawyer representing the ghosts, says he will begin negotiations with the town&rsquo;s haunted house tour guides, spirit shops, and even owners of haunted properties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The living have been exploiting these tortured souls for decades,&rdquo; Johnson told Hennessy&rsquo;s View. &ldquo;The exploitation has gotten significantly more pronounced in recent years, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than 20 Alton companies capitalize on the town&rsquo;s reputation for hauntings. Some of the small firms generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in the weeks surrounding Halloween alone.</p>
<p>Mavis Carter, proprietor of Mavis&rsquo;s Haunted Alton Tours and Spirit Fest, says she may be forced to shut down as a result of the ghost&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re a tiny business. We employ a couple of people year round and few more during Halloween season. I barely make a profit on this as it is. If I have to pay the ghosts, too, I&rsquo;d be better off taking it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike Edwards of SEIU Local 67 in Alton says tour operators like Carter deserve to go under.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These tour operators are modern-day slave traders. They exploit the dead for profits, invade their private residences, and give nothing back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan&rsquo;s office would not respond to requests for information on the legal standing of ghosts in Illinois, but an employee in the AG&rsquo;s office spoke with Hennessy&rsquo;s View on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been an attorney for twenty years, and I think it&rsquo;s long past the time for something like this,&rdquo; the anonymous source told us. &ldquo;Human rights of privacy, property, and a living wage don&rsquo;t end when you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Edwards of the SEIU, there are about nine thousand known and exploited ghosts living in and around Alton. While his union represents only a half-dozen of the more prominent hauntings, he hopes to organize all the ghosts in the river town by end the 2015. But Edwards admits the task won't be easy.</p>
<p>"A lot of these ghosts died before the labor movement really got underway in the late nineteenth century," he said. "There's a lot of Confederate Civil War dead in Alton. When they hear 'union,' they think 'Yankee invaders' not organized labor."</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, it&rsquo;s a matter of posthumous social justice,&rdquo; Edwards said.</p>
