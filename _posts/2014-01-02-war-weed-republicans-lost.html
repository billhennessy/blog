  content: So, are you saying that we as conservatives need to change our views, our
    principles, and hop on that passing bandwagon, 'cause.....there's voters to pick
    up? Bill, I thought better of you. If you were gonna waste all those cyber-pixels
    on an article, AT LEAST you could have gone into detail about how libertarians
    view the issue, etc etc.  But no. Republicans need to 'get with it', and make
    our platform so the hip young folks will love us!  Yeah....sure!   NOT

  content: I almost always agree with you.  This time I don't.  Legalizing pot (weed)
    will only lead to further addictions and more car accidents (since the drivers
    are high).  Once you legalize pot it's a short step to legalizing other drugs
    too. We are going down a slippery slope to a country of drug addicts  Legalzing
    pot just helps us move faster down the slope.

    future under the "economic bus"?  This is all about making a buck on the backs
    of our kids' almost certain deteriorating well being if we go down this road?  As
    for prohibition "never works"...do you want to legalize murder as well, Robyn?  It's
    a foregone conclusion we'll never be able to "prohibit" murder in our country
    either, but we sure don't want to make it more attractive either.  Bad, bad conclusions
    on your part, Bill...one toke over the line.

    feeding pot to minors. \n\nAlso, why is it wise for government to prohibit cannabis

    than vodka? \n\nFinally, I'm reminded of this warning from <a href=\"http://old.nationalreview.com/buckley/buckley200406291207.asp\"
    target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">William F. Buckley Jr. regarding conservatives'
    weird position on cannabis</a>:\n\n<blockquote>Conservatives pride themselves
    on resisting change, which is as it should be. But <strong>intelligent deference
    to tradition and stability can evolve into intellectual sloth and moral fanaticism</strong>,
    as when conservatives simply decline to look up from dogma because the effort
    to raise their heads and reconsider is too great. </blockquote>\n\nRobyn and I

    the debate. I see so many issues in this post, too many to debate in a comment.
    I think this is a very divisive issue that should be set aside until we get on
    a more constitutional track. Republicans/Conservatives/Libertarians are busy enough
    trying to fight progressivism without brining the right to get high into the debate.
    Do we really have to do this now?

  content: "Bill, I believe it's vitally important as adults to \"model\" what's right
    &amp; wrong.  If we legalize something as a society that's previously been banned,
    it sends a signal to our youth that it's OK.  It's even desireable.  I never insinuated
    in my post you personally were condoning the use of marijuana by minors.  I'm
    just saying that's what the end result will be via legalization.  Minors/youth
    take their cues from adults they view as their role models.  Make it legal for
    adults &amp; you encourage our youth to go down that path.  As for prohibiting
    alcohol, it wouldn't bother me in the least.  I'm 62 &amp; haven't had a drink
    in over 29 years &amp; plan to keep it that way.  Not that I'm saying we should
    go back to prohibition...just giving you my personal view of alcohol.\r\n\r\nYou're
    attempting to make an fiscal argument for the legalization of pot &amp; I say
    there's just as valid a case economically against it.  There will be higher healthcare
    costs associated with its usage.  There will be increased legal &amp; personal
    costs due to auto accidents.  I believe we'll see an increase in welfare roles
    with the increased usage of pot.  There's a backside cost of the legalization
    we may not see immediately, but it will eventually be there nonetheless.\r\n\r\nOn
    a personal note, I tried experimenting with pot back in 1972 when I was 21.  I'll
    always remember my first \"toke\" in the back seat of a car with several buddies
    from my hometown of Great Bend, KS.  After 5 or 6 subsequent smoking sessions
    spread out over several months, I came to realize there were significant psychological
    affects from pot usage.  Paranoia &amp; anxiety attacks are a demonstrative result
    of marijuana ingestion.  I ended up in a hospital for 3 days with what was initially
    diagnosed as \"nervous exhaustion\".  Years later I now realize what was the proximate
    cause was...my marijuana experimentation.\r\n\r\nThis isn't about intellectually
    \"resisting change\", it's about doing the \"right thing\".  Legalizing marijuana
    is wrong &amp; will have drastic future consequences.  I also know you're not
    alone in the pushing (intentional, not a Freudian slip) of this agenda.  We've
    had Planned Parenthood push an abortion agenda since the Roe vs Wade SCOTUS decision
    in January of 1973.  That \"change\" should have been resisted then just as much
    as it should be fought against today."

  content: By the way, Bill...I intended to say this previously but I need to define
    for you what my "legalization" of marijuana would be.  I find it deplorable we
    incarcerate anyone in America for the use of drugs.  I believe simple drug usage
    needs to be "decriminalized" to the extent that it only carries a misdemeanor
    charge.  Users still should have to "pay a price" for their actions, just not
    jail time.  Drug dealers, on the other hand, should be locked up &amp; the key
    thrown away.  The bar for charging someone with being a drug dealer should be
    very high to avoid a simple user being caught in the net of enforcement.

    I think we are talking about stop fooling ourselves with old distorted values that keep giving the democrats elections.
    If we embrace those merging towards conservatism, then we are not trading in our values.
    Why is pot illegal, since you do not know why, then why are you against it. I have not smoked pot in 25 years. What made it illegal was a bunch of lies, the war on drugs is lost and expensive. BUT if you legalize it and tax the hell out of it, it moves jobs from law enforcement and corrections to farming and sales and taxation. It is a whole lot cheaper and profitable for a tax man to deal with illegal pot dealers then a swat team. People don't smoke themselves to death, they do drink themselves to death. pot smokers do not beat their spouses, drinkers do. on and on.

    If we embraced the (egads) conservative gays, the conservative women who believe in birth control and abortion we would get those votes and a lot of the swing votes....and why is the party platform anti gay anti abortion?

    The false assumption is correlation is causation. Fallacy 1: Pot is physically  addicting. it is not, alcohol is, heroin is, but pot is not.
    Fallacy 2: you assume that if pot becomes legal everyone will drive drunk. I expect it to remain the same. You might even see a drop in drunk driving if they are choosing pot over alcohol...and unlike drunks, people who are loaded do not have a need to drive.

  content: Hey there. I'm not very "up" on the political ramifications of legalizing
    pot, but I think it should be legalized. Just because of the fact that, as you
    said, the "war" on marijuana is lost. i don't think there would be a massive influx
    of new smokers. I think if you raise your children the right way, they are bound
    to make the right decisions. And i would much rather my child (I have 3) experiment
    with pot than any of the pills people are taking now. Or these synthetic drugs
    they can get so easily. Tax it and regulate it like alcohol. it isn't any worse,
    and many believe it's better. We as a country could sure use the income

  content: Missouri is likely to be one of the first states to legalize it. Certainly
    it will be in the first five here. Show-Me-Cannabis has been one of the nation's
    leaders in the legalization movement and is making strides not only in conservative
    rural Missouri towns, but also the liberal big cities like St. Louis and Kansas
    City. St. Louis and Columbia have both decriminalized Marijuana already, actually.
    The momentum keeps on building and it's coming to a head, and FAST. Missouri is
    right around the corner with legalization and it, too, will enjoy warehouse construction
    on a mass scale as well, which is perfect for St. Louis as the already third largest
    railroad hub in the U.S.

  content: "Bill, I couldn't agree more.  Why do people consistently believe the youth
    of our country can't get weed unless it's made legal?  Any kid in the country
    can tell you where to buy it, simple as that.  Making it legal would, I think,
    take some of the mystique out of it.  It would become the norm and less attractive
    to many kids.  Our youth might even be less exposed to the drug dealer types who
    sell to anyone regardless of their ages.  Would that not, in turn, create a safer
    environment for them?  I don't condone any kids doing any kind of drugs (including
    alcohol), but we know if they want to try it then they likely will.\r\n\r\nTeaching
    kids not to do drugs, like you have stated, is the job of the parents, church
    and schools not the government.  I think therein lies the root cause of many of
    our current social ills.  Just my opinion.\r\n\r\nI'm going to keep a studious
    eye on Uruguay, as they have not only made it legal but set a price limit on it.
    \   I'll be very curious to see how all that turns out, I think the outcome will
    be positive one.\r\n\r\nI don't smoke, by the way, did when I was a young man
    but I've grown up now.  It was a big part of the culture in the Ozarks in those
    days, many of the old timers grew it in their corn fields to supplement the farms
    income.  It was really no big deal, and no it didn't turn out to be the \"gateway\"
    drug many people thought it would be.  We were shown the film \"Reefer Madness\"
    at one point as kids and decided they were just New York people, they were a little
    different and they probably shouldn't be smoking any weed. ;)"

  content: "Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Bill.  I appreciate you continuing
    the conversation about conserving the conservatives' values and viewpoints.  I
    have been a staunch hemptarian (my word) for years, believing that cannabis can
    cure and hemp can heal our world of problems.  I have been hosting a local community
    radio show for years with a show called Vibes with Val and on the last show of
    every month for the last four years, I have hosted Weed Wednesday and have proudly
    interviewed members of Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), National Organization for
    the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), and most importantly Law Enforcement Against
    Prohibition (LEAP).  The best reasons I have ever heard come from these former
    police officers, prosecutors, police chiefs, captains, and more.  I recently interviewed
    Peter Christ, one of the co-founders of the organization and he has some amazing
    words to say about prohibition of consensual adult activity never working in the
    long run.  Find out more about him (and them) at http://copssaylegalizedrugs.ning.com/
    \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for your words, I think Missouri would be smart to be one
    of the first to spread the wealth to industrial hemp farmers as well as cannabis!
    \ Show-Me Cannabis wrote a phenomenal bill for 2012 which garnered over 65,000
    signatures and could do even more for the Show Me State to show me freedom for
    growing whatever greens somebunny wants in my garden. It is more than a drug,
    it is fuel, energy, food, nutrition, fiber and more!"

    the prison population for your specific concern (a little over 90,000py) for the
    indefinite length of time you want to see enforcement occur.  \r\n\r\nWay to spend
    other people's money, with all that strong logic you whipped out above..."

  content: It is obvious that the people commenting have no idea how easy it is to
    get pot in today's world. Drop this middle-aged woman in to any city of at least
    10,000 people and I guarantee i could score some pot by the end of the day....most
    likely from another middle-aged person.  People are using already, and I highly
    doubt that there would be this influx of new users once it's legalized. People
    who are for legalization want it so the threat of going to jail is removed, not
    so they can smoke their brains out and become non-productive members of society.   The
    population that smoke it will continue to do so,legal or not, and those who don't
    aren't going to start just because it's legal.  I think people don't realize just
    how many smoker's there are in this country and they wrongly assume that it will
    be pure mayhem if it's legalized.  It's like alcohol in that regards, most people
    drink responsibly and in moderation, and it's the same with pot.

  content: Dave the problem you run into is that marijuana is harmless. Its been proven.
    There are truckloads of empirical evidence to state this. People my age (26) know
    this. The cat isnout of the bag. People in my generation know that most of the
    trouble with pot has only to do with the fact that is been prohibited to begin
    with. We dont buy the reefer madness bullshit.  I dont believe in fairy tales.
    Noone anywhere I have ever met had a valid anti-marijuana stance based in anythimg
    besides silly supersition and paranoia. If you identify yourself as republican
    than maybe you should wake up. If you are so sure youre right andnon the winning
    sign than consider how much you likely hate Obama and the fact that he won twice
    with no worries and furthermore the republicans have been putting forward awful
    candidates the past several elections and combine that with antiquated out of
    date boogie man stories and pseudo science making claims against  marijuana that
    are simply not true and the long list of other social and fiscal issues republicans
    are absolutely clueless about and it seems to be pretty obvious if a change isnt
    made you guys' future is shaky at best. Dont change if you dont want. But dont
    cry when you never win another election.

  content: "Dennis and Lisa,\r\n\r\nI'll work through your points one by one. Though
    I'm responding directly to Dennis's I'm combining several points.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Social
    Symbolism of Legalization</strong>: Dennis writes, \"If we legalize something
    as a society that&rsquo;s previously been banned, it sends a signal to our youth
    that it&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s even desireable.\" Perhaps some will. More, I believe,
    would take the move as tacit acknowledge that America's draconian cannabis laws
    were wrong to begin with. \r\n\r\nFurther, it seems to me that prohibition takes
    away the meaning of abstinence. If I don't smoke dope because it's against the
    law, I'm merely obeying the law. If I don't smoke dope because of its purported
    negative effects on me or society, I'm setting an example. In this sense, the
    cannabis debate mirrors speed limits. Recently, Illinois raised its maximum speed
    limit to 70 MPH from 55. Is that an endorsement of fast driving? And how long
    will that perceived endorsement hold any meaning? My kids don't remember a time
    when Missouri's limit was 55, so the change in the speed limit law in Missouri
    has no endorsement effect on them.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>The Fiscal Argument</strong>.
    You go on to say, \"You&rsquo;re attempting to make an fiscal argument for the
    legalization of pot & I say there&rsquo;s just as valid a case economically against
    it.\" Here, I'll ask to see your numbers. The total <a href=\"http://hennessysview.com/2013/03/13/the-weednesday-post-guess-how-much-marijuana-prohibition-cost-missouri/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">cost of prohibition in Missouri is about $150 million a year</a>
    according to Harvard and Cato Institute researcher Jeffrey Miron. You seem to
    imply that legalization of cannabis in Missouri would cost more than $150 million
    in increased medical and other costs. But <a href=\"https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/evidence99/marijuana/Health_1.html\"
    target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">even opponents of cannabis law reform admit</a>
    that studies indicate that cannabis use is less physically harmful legal substances
    like alcohol and tobacco.  It is unlikely that the combined costs of cannabis
    regulation and medical treatment would eclipse the $150 million in savings from
    ending prohibition.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Abortion vs. Cannabis</strong>. I'm not
    sure how Roe v. Wade relates to this case, but I will add something. Cannabis
    prohibition seeks to deny individuals the privilege of growing and smoking cannabis.
    It's government vs. the individual. But the abortion debate is another matter,
    morally speaking. In that case, abortion opponents ask government to intervene
    in the murder of a human being. The two issues couldn't be more different. \r\n\r\n4.
    <strong>On the Divisiveness of Prohibition</strong>. Lisa writes, \"I think this
    is a very divisive issue that should be set aside until we get on a more constitutional
    track. Republicans/Conservatives/Libertarians are busy enough trying to fight
    progressivism without brining the right to get high into the debate.\"  That's
    a good question. I debated this for a long time, considering I've been writing
    a semi-regular column since 1993.  I chose to make it an issue on January 1, 2013
    for a very simple reason: I believe proponents of constitutionally limited government
    lose credibility among persuadable potential voters (especially younger people)
    when we oppose cannabis law reform. We lose more credibility when we choose to
    simply ignore the issue and hope it goes away. \r\n\r\nConsidering the history
    of cannabis prohibition, I could argue that it is a glaring symbol of progressivism,
    shoved onto America by FDR's regulators looking for fix after the Volstead Act
    and Amendment 18 went away. \r\n\r\nThe fact is, others are making this an issue.
    Democrats are winning elections by hijacking what should be a center-right position
    to draw otherwise disinterested voters to polls. By championing cannabis law reform,
    just as we champion other regulatory reforms, we have the chance to at least neutralize
    the Democrats' tactic. \r\n\r\nI think Reason.com is more likely to draw young
    voters into the fight for individual liberty against a progressive statist attack
    on freedom. By boldly announcing our willingness to right this wrong, we become
    more consistent and, thereby, more convincing and attractive."

  content: Legalizing Marijuana will be catered towards adults -- Is youth a 21 year
    old?  If youth want to purchase marijuana -- they will be going to there local
    high school drug dealer to pick up a couple of joints after school.  They are
    not going to walk in to a Marijuana store and lay down $250 for an ounce.    If
    you want to throw the health of our youth out the window -- lets take a trip over
    to 7-11 and pick up some cigarettes (thats our problem- and only be 18). ( I amazed
    that I still see so many teens smoking cigarettes in this day and age.)  Nicotine
    is the most addictive drug out there -- but we always look a blind eye towards
    any type of restriction or increasing the taxes on tobacco products (lets not
    upset the tobacco lobbyists/convenience stores).  Missouri has the lowest tax
    rates on tobacco in the country ---and I mean super low.   Most kids (with there
    buddies) can scrounge up $10 dollars for a pack of cigarettes, $15 of a bottle
    of cheap vodka, at any age.  Why do you think there is this epidemic with Crystal
    Meth and youth?  It's cheap to make and cheap to purchase -- don't get me started
    on why our state politicians can't do a better job on limiting access to pseudoephedrine.
    (this from a guy with severe fall allergies).  Also, We need to come up with ways
    to increase our state revenue--we will either taxing new things (like marijuana),
    increase existing taxes (tobacco, alcohol), or we will have take services or reduce
    spending on things we all need (education, healthcare, good roads, etc)?  With
    this being said -- I am a proponent of making sure these new revenue producers
    are spent in right areas----last thing we need are politicians with no spending
    controls.

  content: SMALL GRIPE. The article indicated 578.1 million in sales in a year, not
    a single day as you stated. Enjoyed this post. As a conservative with libertarian

<p>The Republicans are the Leon Spinks of politics these days.</p>
<p>Remember Leon Spinks? He beat Muhammad Ali. Then he got arrested a bunch, gained a lot of weight, and lost to Ali a few months later. He was pretty much done. And Ali was like 50 when Spinks lost to him.</p>
<p>Spinks had the whole world served up on a plate. He tried to eat it all at once. He choked on it.</p>
<p>The Millennials are the largest generation in American history. Bigger than the Boomers. The first 5 years of Millennials (born about 1982 to about 1987) were dyed-in-the-wool liberals. But succeeding cohorts of Millennials have become increasingly libertarian.</p>
<p>They're unhappy with Obama. They hate Obamacare. They want jobs. They want something to do. Oh, and they think marijuana prohibition is stupid.</p>
<p>I've been opposed to pot prohibition since I was in college in the 1980s. Not (just) because I was smoking a lot of pot. Before that I read <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/27/weednesday-post-why-the-gop-needs-to-champion-marijuana-law-reform/">William F. Buckley's views on marijuana prohibition</a>. And I agreed.</p>
<p>After 2006, 2008, and 2012, Republicans knew they had a youth problem. One way to fix that problem was to reframe pot legalization as a jobs program. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/01/01/its-time-to-end-war-on-weed/">Had the GOP taken my advice of January 1, 2013, they would have</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created Jobs: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-31/pot-shops-in-denver-open-door-to-578-million-in-sales.html" target="_blank">Colorado sold $578 million worth of pot TODAY alone</a></li>
<li>Cut Spending: <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/wasted-tax-dollars" target="_blank">The cost of our war on cannabis is $51&nbsp;<em>billion</em> a year</a><em><br />
</em></li>
<li>Stopped Hypocrisy: &nbsp;Kids are looking for a party of freedom, and the war on pot prevents the GOP from seizing that title</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, I hope Republicans and conservatives grow up and face reality. The war on pot is over, and they lost. They can continue fighting it, but they'll lose every time.</p>
<p>The cannabis business is putting people to work in Colorado and Washington--growers, shop owners, distributors, truckers. Every warehouse in the Denver area is filled as a growing operation, forcing developers to build new warehouse parks. All that industry will bypass states like Missouri, whose population growth was almost zero last year.</p>
<p>So far, Democrats get all the credit for ending the war on week. A tiny handful of Republicans, like Missouri State Rep Paul Curtman, have the foresight to advance this issue. If the rest of his party don't get on board soon, 2016 could be another disaster for their party and for the country.</p>
