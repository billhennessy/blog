  content: "I didn't comment on the first article, but am very glad that you approached
    the subject.  Here is a point that I don't believe was mentioned in your article
    or in the comments.  The states that have legalized pot are a part of the United
    States.  Does the legalization in states, violate US obligations as signatories
    to the UN's international drug control treaties?  (I've read some good articles
    on reason.com and stopthedrugwar.org with regard to Bolivia's coca leaf chewing
    population.)  Please don't assume that I agree with our involvement with the UN.
    \ (My opinion on that is that it should be more centrally located - anywhere but
    here.)\r\n\r\nI just find it amusing that when Missouri legislatures try to pass
    laws to protect us from an over-reaching Federal government - we hear screeches
    such as, \"FEDERAL law trumps STATE law - you fools!\"  So, which is it?"

  content: "You're beautifully foreshadowing a future post! \n\nYes, the US law still
    lists cannabis as a substance more dangerous than cocaine or heroin. That US law
    derives from UN treaty on drugs. As a federalist, I appreciate Colorado and Washington
    pushing the issue to the limits. And we saw what happened--the federal government
    backed down.\n\nI'll write more on the matter of UN dictates in the coming weeks."

<p>Last week's Weednesday Post generated several comments that took my side but the facts wrong. Specifically, a couple of commenters claimed "marijuana is harmless." That's not true.</p>
<p>While cannabis may be have fewer harmful effects than alcohol and tobacco, someone who abstains from all three will be healthier mentally and physically than the same person smoking pot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a lot proponents of prohibition throw around bad science, too. The prohibition lobby has generated tons of false "facts" to manipulate the debate.</p>
<p>Luckily,<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/health-effects-of-marijuana-2014-1?op=1" target="_blank"> Business Insider cataloged what we know about cannabis--good and bad</a>. &nbsp;Take a look at this slide show. Here are the top positives and negatives of smoking weed.</p>

<p>Finally, decriminalized or not, cannabis is illegal in Missouri. I think that's a really bad law, but it is the law. In fact, <a href="http://www.mpp.org/states/missouri/" target="_blank">Missouri has the most draconian pot laws in the country</a>. Growing, possessing, buying, selling, and smoking are all crimes. And <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/29/ex-cia-employees-who-garden-indoors-claim-their-kansas-home-was-illegally/" target="_blank">suspicious activity--like an indoor garden--subject you and your family to SWAT raids and searches</a>, even if you've never seen a pot plant.</p>
