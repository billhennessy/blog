  content: "This article is misleading to the point where it presents out and out
    lies.  But this is in keeping with Ms. Tyrrell and certain of her supporters,
    and Mr. Hennessy is among the most dishonest.\r\n\r\nThe so-called $1.2 Mil paid
    to the construction company was deemed in the post-audit follow-up to be properly
    paid for services rendered. \r\n\r\nWhile the State Auditor, who made a policies
    &amp; procedures audit of RSD referred to a (and I quote) \"possible double/over
    payment\" to the construction company, the emphasis was on \"possible\".  While
    the Auditor's report included that Rockwood School District (RSD) believed that
    this money was properly paid, the raised issue compelled them to have legal counsel
    investigate (at taxpayer expense) to determine if there could any grounds for
    recovery.  But the determination was made that this money was indeed owed to the
    construction company and that it was not a \"double/overpayment\", which is why
    Rockwood paid it in the first case.  In fact, when Auditor Schweich returned to
    RSD for his 6-month check back he did did not mention this so-called issue, recognizing
    as a result of RSD followup that it was indeed properly owed to the construction
    company.  So no money was overspent, stolen, or lost. This is the whole story.
    \ But certainly not the story Ms. Tyrrell and Mr. Hennessy want the voters to
    hear and they continually attempt to smear RSD with this in a small-minded attempt
    to glorify Ms. Tyrrell.  \r\n\r\nAs for the teacher's union \"strong-arming teachers\"
    to vote against Ms. Tyrrell... Pray tell how this occurs when the April 8 election
    is a secret ballot, like all of our voting activities?  \r\n\r\nMr. Hennessy mentions
    the Tea Party, which is a loose amalgamation of persons with no formal leader.
    platform, or set of defined goals.  While there are many good people who consider
    themselves \"Tea Partiers\", the organization also contains some bad apples who
    are small minded, ego-driven, dishonest, and incapable of rational thought.  The
    reader can best decide which category Ms. Tyrrell and Mr. Hennessy fall into.\r\n\r\nMs.
    Tyrrell has a lengthy record of distributing misinformation that serves to attack
    Rockwood schools, its teachers, its administrators, and other members of the board
    past and present.  Her communique's, poorly written as they are, contain falsehoods
    that, to the unknowing, give the appearance of supporting the inflammatory headline.
    \ But it is made up.\r\n\r\nI throw down this challenge:  respond of my description
    of the disposition of the $1.2 M, information which I went to great pains to research
    myself, with your description of underlying events.  Or will you just stick to
    your statement of graft with no underpinning facts?\r\n\r\nI leave the readers
    with this quote.  \r\n&ldquo;We live in a world where unfortunately the distinction
    between true and false appears to become increasingly blurred by manipulation
    of facts, by exploitation of uncritical minds, and by the pollution of the language.&rdquo;

  content: "I returned to rebut the insinuation that Rockwood residents are overpaying
    for local education.  First notice that Mr. Hennessy (who is not even a Rockwood
    resident) states that our local taxes are high and implies that Rockwood schools
    is the reason.  I don't enjoy paying taxes more than anyone else, but this prompted
    me to look-up how much Rockwood spends per student.\r\n\r\nFocusing on 22 school
    districts in StL County, Rockwood's expenditure per pupil ranks 20th.  That's
    right, Rockwood ($9364/pupil) provides excellent value, especially when you consider
    that our students' performance on MEAP, SAT, ACT, AP (advanced college placement)
    exams, and graduation rates places it in the top four, along with Clayton ($18372/pupil),
    Ladue ($11,904/pupil), and nearby Parkway ($12,121/pupil).  Rockwood schools are
    a great value by any measure.\r\n\r\nThis leaves me wondering if Mr. Hennessy
    is following Ms. Tyrrell's lead and simply making stuff up to smear Rockwood.
    \ Residents should know that only a portion of their property tax goes to the
    school district and that the many infrastructure improvements in a newer and growing
    community such as ours (firehouses, Chesterfield Town Hall, roads and bike paths,
    parks, city pools, etc.) are relatively early in their pay-off period and that
    this is the larger driver of our taxes."

  content: "Artie,\n\nLet me point out that I am a Rockwood resident and have been
    since Feburary 1996, though I don't expect you to know that. All of my children
    went to Rockwood schools. And I think the classroom education they received and
    are receiving is excellent. For the most part, my kids' teachers were true blessings.
    There were, of course, exceptions, but they were just that. \n\nSecond, I did
    not claim that Rockwood residents overpay for education. I did, however, point
    out that Rockwood's schools board was found to have squandered money and  improperly
    awarded contracts. If you disagree, you might want to talk to the State Auditor.\n\nThird,
    I believe Rockwood's recentspending on infrastructure, and its methods of strong-arming
    voters with bond-issues, leaves a lot to be desired. Broadway-quality theatres
    in the high schools doesn't help students become Broadway actors. It prepares
    them for discouragement when they do their first summer stock production in a
    barn in Nebraska. And that's just one example of opulence that I'm very familiar
    with. (Somehow I managed to get a theatre scholarship coming from a high school
    that used an old storage facility for its productions.) \n\nWhile some capital
    improvements were necessary, and I recognize that, many were not. Election after
    election, we were asked to approve more borrowing for projects that bundled necessary
    improvements and additions with unnecessary extravagance. We were told about population
    growth at the time, but from 2007 to 2011, the student population in Rockwood
    increase by only 102 students, from 22,721 to 22,823, or 0.0045. I believe that
    some demographers are over-estimating the re-urbanization trend, I do believe
    that areas like Rockwood will struggle to increase population over then next generation.
    From the 2000 to 2010 censuses, most of the cities comprising Rockwood lost population,
    though only slightly. Eureka, I believe, was the only big gainer.\n\nSo my point
    is this: Eileen Tyrrell is the only candidate who has been working for all stakeholders--parents,
    teachers, students, taxpayers. No, she hasn't been working for the board. The
    board is there to protect stakeholders and advance their interests. When Eileen
    and other recognized the board's failures, they took it upon themselves to give
    the broader stakeholder population a voice. That voice reached the ear of the
    State Auditor, and he agreed with RSRS's assessment."

  content: "Here we go again.  The State Auditor did NOT determine that RSD (as you
    put it) squandered taxpayer money.  If you search online you will find Auditor
    Scweich's report.  As I mentioned above, he used the phrase description \"possible\",
    and it was subsequently determined to this satisfaction, just as RSD had already
    stipulated in their initial rebuttal, also included in his report, that the funds
    were properly spent.\r\n\r\nIf you also search online you can find the record
    of his 6-month check-back to RSD and he no longer lists this as an issue.\r\n\r\nSo
    why do you guys keep bring it up?  If this is all Ms. Tyrrell has to offer then
    it is thin gruel, indeed.  \r\n\r\nSeparately, as I indicated, our expenditure
    per student is fantastically low, especially for a high performing district.\r\n\r\nThe
    high schools have theaters... that is a big problem?  Don't get me wrong, and
    I have to admit that I am a science guy, but most schools in this demographic
    have theaters.  Also note that by far the largest-cost item are the indoor pools....
    \ but again, this is common in this demographic.  maybe I can shorten this by
    asking what specific capital feature does Rockwood include that is not common
    for this demographic?\r\n\r\np.s. my mistake for stating that you were not a RSD
    resident and thanks for the correction.  I sometimes see Eileen's friends from
    Parkway and elsewhere throw their two cents in.  And note that Parkway passed
    their past several Bond issues, while also spending about 20-25% more per student
    than Rockwood."

  content: '"Still, that good education has come with HUGE price tag. Rockwood is
    one of the most expensive districts in Missouri. Property taxes for residents
    are almost double the average car payment." Can you support this statement with
    some facts? Seems pretty arbitrary to me. I checked my taxes (totaled $3700) of
    which about 2/3 goes to Rockwood. For sake of argument I will use the full $3700.
    That equals out to 12 payments of $308. That happens to be lower than my car payment.
    A google search returned an article that quoted average monthly payments for a
    new car are at $471 and a used car at $352. That also does not take into account
    that my home has a value of around $250k and my car is around $15k.'

    the \"possible\" over-payments as well as solicited the review by a project management
    expert. Both concluded these were not over-payments. This conclusion contradicts
    your central tenet so I am interested to hear your response. If the Missouri auditor,
    legal and project management experts concluded this is not an issue why do you
    continue to report that it is?"

  content: "Michael,\r\nYou are incorrect.  Rockwood's expenditure per student is
    near the bottom, at 20th place, among the 22 StL county school districts, and
    WAY below Parkway, our nearest neighbor district.  In increasing order: Bayless
    ($7559), Mehlville ($8351), ROCKWOOD ($9364), Ritenour ($9402), Riverview Gardens
    ($9471), Lindbergh ($9529), Hazelwood ($10,493), Affton ($10,709), Jennings ($10,902),
    Valley Park ($11,158), Hancock Place ($11,302), Ferguson-Florrisant ($11,313),
    Webster Groves ($11,356), ladue ($11,902), Parkway ($12,121), Kirkwood ($12,210),
    Normandy ($12,276), University City ($12,288), Pattonville ($14,369), maplewood
    ($15,088), Brentwood ($17,188), Clayton ($18,372).  See p. 9 of: http://www.rockwood.k12.mo.us/finance/Downloads/2013-2014%20Budget%20Overview.pdf\r\n\r\nContinuing
    the Parkway comparison since they are near neighbors, they have passed their last
    several school bond ballots while Rockwood's  last several ballots have failed
    to pass.\r\n\r\nFurther, Rockwood's teacher salaries were in the lower 25%.  They
    were given a small raise by the Board last fall with the promise that they will
    eventually be brought-up to near the county average.  As for Rockwood school administrators,
    their salaries were second from the bottom of this 22 school district list.  Also
    note that Rockwood's administrator to student ratio is the lowest in the state,
    far more lean than any other district in the county.\r\n\r\nClosing, it should
    be mention that Rockwood students score in the upper 20%, with Parkway, Ladue,
    Kirkwood, and Clayton, on standardized tests, the percentage of Nat'l Metic Scholars,
    scores on AP (advanced placement) exams, etc. \r\n\r\nBy any measure, Rockwood
    provides great value.  This data also helps keep your property values high."

  content: "Sorry for the typos in the above message; I at the age where I could benefit
    from reading glasses...\r\n\r\nBut continuing; why are property taxes what they
    are?  I don't know how Rockwood compares to other school districts for tax millage
    going to the schools, but can make some informative observations, none of which
    are the fault of those running our Rockwood Schools.\r\n\r\nCompared to the other
    StL county school districts in the above list, Rockwood's population growth is
    relatively new.  We have many young families settling in West County and we all
    see the ever-expanding house construction in Rockwood due to the vacant land available
    for building.  This results in Rockwood having undergone a population boom over
    the last 20 years, and with the boom came young families and children.  This led
    to the construction of new schools, and expansion of existing schools.  We have
    many relatively new schools, and they also needed equipment purchases, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile
    some of the older schools have had their construction bonds paid off, Rockwood
    has a relatively greater percent of its schools' construction debt still being
    paid off.  This is also true of other city features, such as the new Chesterfield
    Town Hall, amphitheater, and aquatic center.  Like a home mortgage, these are
    being paid-off over time.\r\n\r\nThere was not much choice in building these schools.
    \ Rockwood could have done what one St. Charles county school district did, and
    avoid new construction by going to year-round classes, where the kids are divided
    into three groups and they cycle through the year with one group taking \"summer\"
    break during each of the three \"semesters\" making up the year round school year.
    \ This is unpopular with families so no surprise this was not done.  Or Rockwood
    could have constructed a multitude of pre-fab detached classrooms and placed the
    expanding number of students into these.  This is also unpopular with parents.
    \ It also drags-down property values (as a parent, would you select to buy home
    in such a district over another one nearby that did not use the pre-fab classrooms?).\r\n\r\nThe
    nature of this is that Rockwood is paying off school expansion construction from
    the growth era.  A recent Rockwood study came to the conclusion that this big
    growth period is over, and we will see more and more of this debt retired."

  content: "Mr McCown, the reason the overpayments cannot be returned is largely due
    to the fact that the Board of Education approved those payments.  If the board
    had been doing their due diligence and asking the appropriate questions rather
    than simply rubberstamping the 1.2 million would have never been \"over paid\".
    \ \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that Directors Kinder and Doell approved those overpayments!
    \ It should also be noted that, Director Doell is the Vice President of Sachs
    Electric with contract experience.  How many classroom support staff could we
    have hired for 1.2 or better yet, what additional construction projects could
    have been completed.  \r\n\r\nThese are FACTS and the referenced source is Rockwood
    School District Boarddocs\r\n\r\nCommon sense does not require credentials and
    credentials do not always come with common sense.  \r\n\r\nIt is time to put the
    responsibility where it belongs; squarely on the Board of Directors, at the time
    of the poor decisions and failed leadership.  Directors Kinder and Doell are the
    last 2 incumbents of that board, their leadership got us into this mess and we
    cannot count on them to get us out of it.  \r\n\r\nSimply put, the trust of the
    entire Rockwood community must be restored.  The only way to move beyond the past
    is to vote it out once and for all."

    \ \r\n\r\nThe achievement gap in Rockwood has grown to 60% in Math and 50% in
    Communication Arts.  That is a tell tale sign that we need to give our great teachers
    more resources and support in the classroom.  This achievement gap has been growing
    over the last several years, an issue discussed, but no clear solutions given.
    \ \r\n\r\nOur students deserve all the support necessary for them to succeed.
    \ \r\nAs a Board Director I will not shy away from the tough decisions necessary
    to give our students whatever they need to succeed.  \r\n\r\nIn Rockwood every
    administrator has a secretary, yet our primary and elementary level teachers share
    support aides for their classroom.  This is a problem that is showing up in our
    achievement gap and must be addressed.  I will advocate all teachers are heard
    and they are given what they need in order for their students to succeed.  \r\n\r\nOpenly
    discussing these issues does not make me \"anti-Rockwood\" I believe it makes
    me \"pro-Rockwood\".  \r\n\r\nWe are only as good as our weakest link."

    per student ranks among the bottom, at 20th out of 22 StL county school districts.
    \ This spending is compiled to represent the SPENDING per student, while she is
    (typical for her) off-track and discussing where she thinks the money comes from.
    \ \r\n\r\nAnd even to this end she is incorrect.  The vast majority of spending
    per child is through the yearly operations budget. Teacher salaries and benefits,
    utilities, supplies, books, and the like are represented by this spend.  \r\n\r\nBy
    their very nature, bonds are used for capital expenditures: equipment purchases,
    large project building repairs, construction and the occasional long-term software
    license.\r\n\r\nAnd Rockwood has failed to pass the last several bond proposals.
    \ Taking a moment to compare with neighboring Parkway, they not only spend significantly
    more per pupil, they have ALSO passed their last several bond proposals.  \r\n\r\nI
    don't want to justify all of her nutty accusations with replies, but the Rockwood
    administrator to student ratio is very efficient, so much so that it is in a class
    of it's own within the entire state.  Should we be surprised that there is a reliance
    on lower wage secretarial staff to support this efficiency?\r\n\r\nThese complaints
    are in keeping with Mrs. Tyrrells attack-dog style, which unfortunately, is also

  content: "More misinformation from Mrs. Tyrrell as she seeks to drum-up support
    for the April 8 School Board election.\r\n\r\nFirst, what is the \"Achievement
    Gap\"?  This is not a measure of how well Rockwood students are doing, but instead
    represents the gap in standardized score performance as measured betwen the Rockwood
    student average and a smaller cohort of students who meet a state definition of
    minority ethnic group, race, or special needs.   \r\n\r\nBefore continuing you
    should note that the Rockwood student average on standardized tests is well above
    the state average, and over the last several exam periods has essentially not
    wavered.  Rockwood students performance is among the highest in the state, and
    is nationally ranked.  This is no small feat for a Missouri school since Missouri
    students, as a whole, perform below the national average.  With this perspective,
    let's continue.\r\n\r\nWhat has marginally slipped over the last few testing cycles
    is the average score of this \"disadvantaged\" student subgroup.  But what does
    this mean?  As a professional scientist I find no smoking gun here.\r\n\r\nThe
    first % is the average score by the ENTIRE Rockwood population and the second
    % is the average score by this \"disadvantaged\" group: \r\n\r\nschool year 2010-2011
    =  70.6%  vs.  45.1%  (% gap is 25.5)\r\nschool year 2011-2012 =  71.3%  vs.  47.3%
    \ (%gap is 24.0)\r\nschool year 2012-2013 =  71.1%  vs.  43.2% (% gap is 27.9)\r\n\r\nThe
    reader should note that for 2011-2012, the gap actually improved, but then widened
    in 2012-2013.  Also note how tight the average score remains.  Although I show
    the the math results, the Communication Arts results are comparable.\r\n\r\nBut
    beyond student performance, this analysis also tests the limits of population
    studies.  The average score represents thousands of students (Rockwood has ~2000
    students per grade level), making the \"average\" statistically meaningful, and
    delivering a very tight scoring range.  But Rockwood does not have some many \"disadvantaged\"
    students meeting the state's definition of \"ethnicity, race, or special needs\".
    \  In fact, Rockwood is practically all white, not including many ethnic minorities,
    either, and these make up the bulk of the \"disadvantaged\" population in most
    other school districts.  \r\n \r\nThe result is that Rockwood's relatively quite
    small \"disadvantaged\" sub-group is too small to provide a statistically valuable
    average. \r\n\r\nEither Mrs. Tyrrell just does not understand this or she is blowing
    smoke in an attempt to help her failing campaign for a School Board Seat.\r\n\r\nSee:

  content: "From the taxpayer's perspective, Artie, money is money. Whether my taxes
    go to luxurious theatres or to teachers, it's money I cannot choose to spend because
    Rockwood Schools chose to spend it for me. \n\nYou've wasted a lot of pixels telling
    the world that spending on buildings is very important to you. Much more important
    than spending on teachers or students or better transportation. \n\nThat's fine.
    That's your opinion.  But disagreeing with Ms. Tyrrell and me doesn't make us
    wrong or you right. \n\nFor the record, my wife's a teacher, as I've chronicled
    here many times before. So maybe I'm a little biased. I don't know.\n\nWhat's
    your dog in this race? Why have you invested so much time and energy and emotion
    and anger into this blog? For the record, how will this election affect you personally?"

  content: "Mr. Hennessy communicated to me that I have used a lot of pixels responding
    debunking his and Eileen Tyrrells outlandish attacks on Rockwood Schools and the
    School Board members.\r\n\r\nHe say that too much money spent is too much money
    spent.  But where do they get \"too much money\".  Rockwood under-spends nearby
    parkway by a great deal on a per student basis.  In fact, we are near the bottom
    of the county (20th out of 22 districts).  So I think we can interpret this as
    them meaning that they just don't want to spend any money now that their own children
    are out of, or nearly out of school.  To paraphrase, they would \"cut off your
    nose to spite their face\".  As for me have one boy in college and a daughter
    in high school, so my not advocating that we not incur their steep cuts in school
    spending (beyond what has already occurred through the recession), is not about
    me.\r\n\r\nI don't think that there is any damage they could do quickly enough
    to affect my daughter.  So I am not speaking from a position of \"it's about me\"
    when I encourage voters to continue to support their schools (which also support
    property values). Just note that if we compare to the rest of StL country schoold
    discticts, which include many with much smaller average incomes than Rockwood's,
    they support their schools with a greater level of funding than these Tea Party
    types want."

  content: "Rereading Mr. Hennessy's note to me I realized that I failed to respond
    to his inquiry about why I was involved.  What was my \"dog in the fight\".  This
    is a good question and I can attempt a reply.  I have not close friend or family
    member employed by Rockwood schools.  But I do have a better than average understanding
    of just what a good education confers.  And when I say good, it is a continuum,
    and there is always better.  But we will focus on the value component.  By way
    of background, I have been around, attending 11 schools districts by 10th grade,
    being raised by a single mother.  But I eventually earned a Ph.D. in chemistry
    while attending Johns Hopkins Univ, Univ. of Wisc., and Columbia Univ., attending
    school until I was 29 (and completely broke). \r\n\r\nIn my professional career
    I have mentored many young undergraduates in my laboratories (I am now out of
    industrial pharma research and an associate professor in academics) and have seen
    how lacking many modern children are in math, science, and verbal skills.  Do
    I know what a first class education looks like?  Well, my son graduated a couple
    of years ago from one of the Rockwood high schools in 3rd place of 550 students,
    also a Natl Merit Scholar Finalist.  For AP exams, he scored 10 fives and 4 fours.
    \ 800 on his SAT verbal score; remarkable for a pre-engineering major boy.  My
    daughter is on the way to replicate this 9she hopes), but she is in the top ten
    at her H.S.  far from \"eggheads\" I encouraged my kids to play guitar, trumpet,
    and violin.  They both Letter-ed in sports.  Rockwood has prepared them well for
    the outside world and it is very competitive out there.  I won't even go into
    the undisputed fact that the mest paying jobs of the future will be STEM-type
    (science / math / engineering), something that American kids are performing quite
    poorly at, by all measures.  My sense of patriotism tells me that we need to fix
    this if the U.S. is going to remain a place of future high employment.\r\n\r\nI
    think this education was provided at a great value by Rockwod and other children
    should have the same opportunity.  But I cringe when I hear Eileen Tyrrell speak
    of cuts, cuts, and cuts.  There is no detail to her discussion.  As already mentioned
    in my comments herein, the teacher and administrator salaries in Rockwood are
    not by any measure \"high\".  So what would be cut, really?  Even you must note
    that, whether you like the school theater or not, it is there and there is no
    way to remove it to \"un-ring the bell\" for construction spending.  By the way,
    my graduation high school did not have a pool, a theater, a track, or even a paved
    parking lot - and only a couple of my peers went on to college.\r\n\r\nActive
    citizens need to identify what they would do to achieve better value.  Cutting
    within a district that is already among the more lean in the county seems like
    hyperbole.  So I pose back to you the question, what would you do?  Rhetoric is
    not a solution and you can see that I have looked deeply into RSD spending and
    know that it comares very favorably to others in the county.  \r\n\r\nAnd, pray
    tell, what does a car payment have to do with property taxes?  if you want a better
    ratio, then either buy a cheaper car or live way out in the country where taxes
    are extremely low - and then maybe you too will be sending your kids to a school
    with few amenities, and your teacher wife (no disrespect here) would earn a far
    lower salary.  You want significantly lower school taxes, go visit a rural school
    and see how their amenities compare to Rockwood's and tell me which you would
    rather pay to send your kids too.  A good question.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity
    to speak candidly."

<p>Do you live in Rockwood School District?</p>
<p>I do. My kids all went to Rockwood schools. My wife taught in a Rockwood school for three years.</p>
<p>The teachers in Rockwood tend to think a lot like the people who live here. They're not a bunch of wacked-out lefties. Not most of them.</p>
<p>Still, that good education has come with HUGE price tag. Rockwood is one of the most expensive districts in Missouri. Property taxes for residents are almost double the average car payment.</p>
<p><strong>And Rockwood's board and administrators have a long, ugly history of scandal, corruption, and waste.</strong> The Missouri Auditor and the Missouri Ethics Commission practically have field offices at Rockwood's headquarters.</p>

</ul>
<p>For me, that last bullet is the root of all Rockwood's evil. School board members get arrogant and secretive. The Rockwood Board does the bidding of the NEA instead of representing the taxpayers who build and maintain the schools. They use your tax dollars to extort more of your tax dollars. They want it all.</p>
<p>That's why<strong> Rockwood needs a real champion of education&nbsp;<em>and</em> the people.</strong></p>

<p>If not for <a href="http://rockwoodcitizensforeileentyrrell.com/about/" target="_blank"><strong>Eilleen Tyrrell</strong>,</a> that crooked construction company would still be pocketing millions of your tax dollars illegally. <a href="http://rsdstakeholders.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Eilleen Tyrrell and Lisa Hunt Earls formed Rockwood Stakeholders for Real Solutions</strong> </a>in 2011. Eilleen wanted to give taxpayers a voice.</p>
<p><strong>Eileen Tyrrell gave you a voice, and that voice made your schools better</strong>. But it wasn't easy. RSRS continues to battle the NEA-appointed Board of Education at every turn.</p>
<p>The union bosses and their hand-picked BOE think your money is their play toy. And they don't like citizen activists like Eileen protected your pockets.</p>
<p>Last year, Eileen made a difficult decision. As one of the boldest, most tenacious ambassadors of accountability in education, Eileen decided she needed to represent you on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>I support and Eileen Tyrrell for Rockwood School Board on April 8th</strong>--and every other day of the year.</p>
<p>I meet a lot of people through St. Louis Tea Party activities. Many of those people come out and do a lot of hard work. But that work takes a toll. Most cannot sustain their effort over a long period.</p>
<p><strong>Eileen Tyrrell never gives up.</strong> Eileen has fought the good fight--and won--more than anyone I've met in the 5 years that the Tea Party has been around.</p>
<p>Now, the NEA is strong-arming teachers to fight Eileen. Some of those union-blinded teachers will put pressure on you and on your kids to stand by the old guard and their secretive, expensive, corrupt ways.</p>
<p>One Rockwood teacher wrote an impassioned Facebook post encouraging you to vote the way her union bosses tell you to vote.</p>
<p>But you're not like that. <strong>You chose to live in Rockwood because you know that hard, honest work wins out.</strong> You don't take orders from union bosses, and you don't let elected officials secretly divvy out your tax dollars to their friends.</p>
<p>I am confident that you will join me in supporting and <strong>electing Eileen Tyrrell on April 8th</strong>.</p>
<p>If you believe in government accountability and good schools <strong>you will click this link</strong>, send <a href="https://fundly.com/citizens-for-eileen-tyrrell" target="_blank">Eileen a few dollars to fight the NEA's millions</a>, and ask just 2 other people to vote for Eileen on April 8th. That's the only election you need to care about.</p>
<p><strong>Vote for Eileen Tyrrell on April 8th in Rockwood School District</strong>.</p>
