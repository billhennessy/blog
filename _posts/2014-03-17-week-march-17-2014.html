  content: "Thanks for the additional information, Byron. \n\nNot surprising. Eileen
    is of the people. The Rockwood Board, on the other hand, has a tradition of hiding
    from taxpayers."

<p>Here's a roundup of what to look for in the coming week.</p>
<h3>St. Louis</h3>
<p><strong>Monday, 12:30 p.m</strong>.: <strong><a href="http://stlouis.about.com/od/topattractions/a/Dogtown_Parade.htm" target="_blank">The Ancient Order of Hibernians' Annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dogtown</a></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get there early. Give yourself time to park and walk. Dress warmly.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, 5:00 p.m</strong>.: <strong>Protest of St. Louis Archdiocese</strong> for its promotion of City-County Merger. Location is Lindell and Grand.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, 7:00 p.m.</strong>: <strong>The activist who helped expose scandal, waste, and corruption at Rockwood School District</strong> is running for the Rockwood School Board.<strong> Eileen Tyrrell</strong> will speak a the Meramec Republican Township meeting at the Eureka Fire Station 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;4849 Highway 109. &nbsp;Eileen previously founded <a href="http://rsdstakeholders.org/2014/03/11/will-the-voters-turn-the-page/" target="_blank">Rockwood School District Stakeholders</a> to do what the board was supposed to do--protect tax payers.</p>
<h3>Missouri</h3>
<p><strong>All Week</strong>: Missouri General Assembly takes its Spring Break, so the march to legitimize red light cameras slow down.</p>
<h3>USA</h3>
<p><strong>All Week</strong>: US Congress on its Spring Break. I used to say "the republic is safe" when Congress is on break. With Obama running his own private legislature, though, the real Congress is always on break and the republic always in peril.</p>
<h3>In Case You Missed It</h3>

<p><a title="This Book Predicted Russia&rsquo;s Ukraine Adventure. Poland&rsquo;s Next." href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/03/16/predicted-russias-ukraine-adventure-polands-next/" target="_blank">This Book Predicted Russia's Ukraine Adventure.</a> And it can tell you what's like to happen next.</p>
