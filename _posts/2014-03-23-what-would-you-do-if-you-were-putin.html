<p>You saw Obama stand by as you threatened Georgia in 2009.</p>
<p>You heard Obama whisper to Medvedev that he&rsquo;ll be willing to defy Congress to capitulate to you after Obama&rsquo;s re-election.</p>
<p>You watched Obama and his bumbling Secretary of State mangle its its own strategy in Syria&mdash;if the US ever had a Syrian strategy at all.</p>
<p>You saw that the US was completely unprepared for your annexation of Crimea.</p>
<p>You see the headlines of massive NSA spying on US citizens, though that same NSA was blind to your invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>And you know that Obama will be a lame duck, weakened, unpopular president until January 20, 2017.</p>
<p>Think is, you have no idea what kind of leader will follow Obama.</p>
<p>You remember that the American people replaced a similarly weak and bumbling Jimmy Carter with the determined, affable cowboy Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Vladimir Putin, wouldn&rsquo;t you grab all the land you can before the next American election?</p>
