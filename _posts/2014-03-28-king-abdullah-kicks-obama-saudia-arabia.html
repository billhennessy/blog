  content: 'Putin dishes Obama with Snowden.. Obama persecutes Putin in the media
    for a law that doesn''t allow gays to target youth with propaganda.. Saudi and
    other muslim countries kill gays on a regular basis.. completely outlawing them..
    no concerns or questions raised by media or Obama.. double standard? big time..
    now that the Saudi King dished Obama and cancelled dinner with him.. CNN releases
    article about gay refugee from Saudi .. Moral of this story: don''t dish Obama
    or he''ll attack you with the gay agenda'

  content: "Michael, thanks for the comment.\n\nI don't know Putin's desire to advance
    to Poland, but I do suspect that Russia's long-term aim is to re-establish Soviet
    borders and buffers. If you follow the links, you'll see a series of posts that
    explain. \n\nMy original interest what Putin might want to do comes from the book
    \"The Next 100 Years\" by <a href=\"http://www.stratfor.com/\" target=\"_blank\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">STRATFOR </a>founder George Freidman. I, of course, could be
    completely wrong, as could Mr. Friedman.\n\nBut if Friedman is right and Russia
    will attempt to re-establish those protective borders and buffers, then Putin's
    clock it ticking. The next US presidential election could sweep in an administration
    and a national mood that's very different from the present and recent past.\n\nBTW,
    I'm also a big believer in Strauss and Howe's generational view of history. Again,
    they could be wrong. If they're right, though, we are in the mid-early stages
    of a Crisis era that will end with something big and terrible. Previous crisis
    eras ended with WWII, the Civil War, the American Revolution, etc. (working backwards).
    Moods matter to these eras more than circumstances. Few people with firsthand
    memories of WWII remain influential or in control. The generations running the
    world--Boomers at the top, Millennials at the bottom, Xers in between--know of
    the Depression and WWII only from movies, books, and history classes. We can understand
    that time, but we cannot feel it. When the Depression/WWII era began, the Civil
    War generations had just exited the public stage. When the Civil War era started,
    the Revoluationaries had just departed. And so forth.\n\nI'm not a \"sky is falling\"
    eschatologist, just a guy trying to sort out an increasingly unstable world so
    I can get through life best I can."

  content: "Thanks, Paul. Not forgetting that. Just not going there. I think Obama's
    lack of leadership is more worrisome to the Saudis than a newspaper's specious
    speculation on Obama's membership in a political union. \n\nLike it or not, the
    world still looks to the US for leadership and protection. We brought some of
    that upon ourselves during and after the Cold War, but the consequences exist.
    Nature abhors a vacuum, and so do leaders of nations that feel vulnerable when
    their perceived protector becomes unwilling or unable to protect them."

  content: "\"the world still looks to the US for leadership and protection.\"\r\n\r\nYeah,
    right. In your dreams. I think the world is sick and tired of the US with their
    threats, bullying, global 24 hour spying, never ending wars, the use of false
    flag attacks like 9-11 to to justify an invasion of countries such as of Afghanistan
    and Iraq, destabilisation or the overthrowing of countless governments around
    the world through the use of NGOs and terrorists funded by the US State Department
    such as in Libya, Syria, Mali, C.A.R., Sudan, Yemen, Pakistan, Ukraine just to
    name a few.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest risk to world peace is without any shadow of
    a doubt the crazed madmen who control the USA. People need protecting from the
    US. To be honest I wish Washington DC or maybe the whole of the USA could be towed
    into outer space. Then we might actually have peace on this planet."

    an Obamafied wimpy America with aggression and land grabs.  Lets not forget the
    South China sea where China likely will grab land  from a few different countries

  content: "There's a difference between leadership and military adventurism. I agree
    that US foreign policy has conflated the two over the past two decades. But world
    leadership is very different from mere interventionism. \n\nWhen the world looks
    for a leader, it asks questions like these:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Do they do what they
    say?</li>\n\t<li>Do they support friends and challenge foes?</li>\n\t<li>Do they
    set a good example with internal policies?</li>\n\t<li>How do they treat people/nations
    who can't do anything for them?</li>\n</ul>\n\nThese are also traits of individual
    leaders, of course. Nowhere on the list is \"has a big gun.\""

  content: "-- \"Nowhere on the list is &ldquo;has a big gun.&rdquo;\"\r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    be so idealistic.\r\n\r\nThose four questions are relevant to the leadership issue
    only if it/he does &ldquo;have a big gun.&rdquo; (((\r\n\r\nSo far recently the
    USA has failed to be yes on the four questions and has a big gun. Which makes
    it a crazily dangerous leader.   \r\n\r\nEven more it can support the big gun
    only by hopelessly borrowing money from its competitors. Which makes it a fragile
    flaky crazily dangerous leader."

  content: Maybe Obama asked the King, "Why did you do 9/11?". You see, Bush made
    a grave error. He 'let it happen", then started a retarded war in Afganistan,
    then an illegal war in Iraq. For all the crap Obama takes, he has 'ended' the
    2 wars and now, maybe, just maybe, he is addressing the real problem on this planet....those
    radical Sunni, Wababi(sp?) Saudi's.

  content: Oh yeah, couple of other things. Obama 'inherited' the trillion dollar
    deficit and financial crisis post-2008 and has managed it fairly well, maybe a
    B+.The deficit, although high is finally on the right trajectory (~650,000 billion).
    Finally, he has put that rabid dog NetaYahoo on a short lease. So to all the flaky
    (far right?) Americans out there, what do you want, a president that ramps up
    (phony) wars and deficits or one that ends war and attempts to get the country
    on a better financial, economic footing?

<p>You'd think American foreign policy couldn't sink any lower than standing by while Vladimir Putin re-conquers the Warsaw Pact nations. Then you've underestimated Barack Obama's incompetence.</p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/04/09/did-president-obama-really-bow-to-saudi-king/" target="_blank">Obama didn't bow low enough </a>to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Whatever happened, an "intimate" evening planned for Obama and Abdullah was abruptly cancelled after a two-hour meeting between the two leaders. A meeting intended to "mend fences" between the two men.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: Here's the video from Lou Dobbs on Fox Business</strong></p>

<p>The White House is now denying there was &nbsp;dinner scheduled. They've scrubbed all references from the White House web site, they've demanded return of printed copies of the schedule (and the state media complied). They've even deleted a State Department tweet about the dinner. Before the MSM finishes scrubbing their sites, I grabbed a few screens. Here's what <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/departing-europe-obama-seeks-to-reassure-saudis/2014/03/28/04b207aa-b647-11e3-bab2-b9602293021d_story.html" target="_blank">WaPo</a> said this morning:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_14496" align="aligncenter" width="1072"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wapo-obama-abdullah.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-14496" alt="Washington Post reports Obama's overnight stay and dinner with King Abdullah" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wapo-obama-abdullah.png" width="1072" height="424" /></a> Washington Post reports Obama's overnight stay and dinner with King Abdullah[/caption]</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/28/obama-saudi-king/6999713/" target="_blank">USAToday</a>:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_14495" align="aligncenter" width="594"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/usa-today-obama-abdullah.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-14495" alt="USA Today Story Reports Dinner with King Abdullah." src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/usa-today-obama-abdullah.png" width="594" height="507" /></a> USA Today Story Reports Dinner with King Abdullah.[/caption]</p>
<p>But the dinner was cancelled:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Dinner cancelled! Obama has departed King Abdullah's desert retreat after 2 hr mtg - he was originally scheduled to stay for dinner. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KSA&amp;src=hash">#KSA</a> &mdash; Molly Hunter (@mollymhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/mollymhunter/statuses/449615798366392320">March 28, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async=""></script><br />
Fox News reported that a <strong>State Department tweet posted earlier today was deleted&nbsp;</strong><em>after</em> the White House announced that there never was a dinner planned between Abdullah and Obama. The White House would not explain why the dinner appeared on the President's official schedule and the press briefing.</p>
<p>What we do know is this: King Abdullah thinks Obama's a wimp who screwed up the whole Syria thing then appeased Iran on nuclear weapons. Abdullah has stated flat out that if Iran gets nukes, Saudi Arabia will go nuclear.</p>
<p>Apparently, Obama's fawning, bowing, obsequious routine didn't impress Abdullah. In fact, I'm pretty sure the King takes Obama for a child playing a man's role.</p>
<p>It's highly unusual for a<strong> US President to be effectively kicked out of a country</strong>--especially an allied country. Coming on the heels of Obama's feckless deterrent in Eastern Europe, Iran's flouting of the toothless agreement we signed in the fall, and Obama's collapsing support at home, the world now witnesses a weird scenario in which Saudia Arabia and Israel become the only "Western" countries capable of bare-knuckle diplomacy with the world's land-grabbers.</p>
<p>What's to stop Putin from marching through Ukraine straight into Poland? As I said, <a title="What Would You Do If You Were Putin?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/03/23/what-would-you-do-if-you-were-putin/" target="_blank">Putin knows he has an open window to seize all the land he wants until January 20, 2017.</a></p>
