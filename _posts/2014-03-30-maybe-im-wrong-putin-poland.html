<p>When you've stated your opinion or belief about something important, do you defend your belief to the hilt? Or do you immediately begin questioning your own conclusions?</p>
<p>Most of my life, I would defend my opinion to the point of losing friends. Even if I was wrong. Even I&nbsp;<em>knew</em> I was wrong. I'm a coward, what can I say?</p>
<p>I'm trying to get better, though. One practice I've developed and recommend to everyone is pretty simple but difficult. The week between Christmas and New Years, I list my Top 10 Unquestionable Beliefs. Then I try my best to debunk each one.</p>
<p>I don't blog them. I don't carry around my list and review it every day. It's a one-day exercise. And each round begins the same, with the Apostles' Creed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem; Creatorem coeli et terrae.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>You could say the Apostles' Creed is eight beliefs, but I consider it one. Then there are other beliefs, like, I am a terrible father and son, I've wasted most of my life seeking instant gratification, and the like. I've never debunked any of those, but I keep trying.</p>
<p>I have debunked a few of my beliefs with this process. One such belief involves my prior faith in the Republican Party to create a more perfect society. I think the GOP would suck less than the Democrat Party. But I no longer trust the GOP, as it's currently formed, to actually improve things very much. There's just too much money and power in perpetuating the crap.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit to my faith challenges, though, has been in my ability to question my own opinions about everything. It's liberating. I finally get to admit I'm wrong when I'm wrong and celebrate that I found a better idea than the one I had.</p>
<p>I mention all this because I've been writing lately about Putin's intentions in Eastern Europe. In <a title="What Will Putin Do?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/03/17/will-putin/">What Will Putin Do? </a>I speculate that he will advance into Eastern Ukraine. In <a title="What Would You Do If You Were Putin?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/03/23/what-would-you-do-if-you-were-putin/">What Would You Do If You Were Putin</a>, I point out that Putin's window for restoring Soviet borders and buffers might close with the next US presidential election. In <a title="Now, the White House Says Russia Preparing to Invade Ukraine" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/03/23/now-the-white-house-says-russia-preparing-to-invade-ukraine/">Now The White House Says Russia Preparing to Invade Ukraine</a>, I explain why seizing more land and conquering or intimidating more countries could be in Putin's best interest.</p>
<p>Today, though, I read Charles Hugh Smith's blog&nbsp;<b><a href="http://www.oftwominds.com/blogmar14/peak-putin3-14.html" target="_blank">Have We Reached Peak Putin?</a>&nbsp;</b>I read it, and I agree with many of his points. I only wish my posts had been as thorough, intelligent, and well-reasoned as Mr. Smith's. &nbsp;His conclusion contradicts my own, as he says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Given the context laid out above, it seems increasingly likely that we've reached Peak Putin.</b>&nbsp;The capture of a few pawns has cleared the chessboard, but the strategic choices already made have greatly reduced Putin's room to maneuver.</p></blockquote>
<p>I still believe that Putin is far from finished. I'm not saying Russian tanks roll tomorrow (though they might). I am saying Putin&nbsp;<em>intends</em> to restore Soviet borders and buffers.</p>
<p>Still, you should read Smith's post before accepting my arguments. I could be wrong. Or I could be right. History will tell.</p>
