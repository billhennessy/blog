<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Matt Henley and I am a marketing consultant based in Los Angeles.  I am trying to reach out to the person that handles the marketing decisions for your company. </p>
<p>I'd like to offer a free marketing audit and discuss the results and my analysis with you. I&rsquo;ll be able to give you insight into site&rsquo;s performance, organic search visibility, adwords advice and answer any other marketing questions you might have to help you better understand your past, present and future marketing efforts.  This information is absolutely free and requires zero obligation. </p>
<p>The companies we work with have benefited from these sorts of insights regardless of whether they work with or without us.  Do you have time this week to hop on a call? I&rsquo;d love to have the opportunity to show you guys some ways you can better and more efficiently grow your business.  I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Matt Henley<br />
