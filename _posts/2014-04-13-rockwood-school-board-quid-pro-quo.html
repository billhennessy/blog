<p>From the "see, I told ya so" file . . .</p>
<p>Rockwood NEA President Suzanne Dotta worked hard to influence the recent school board election. The candidates Ms. Dotta pushed won.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockwood.k12.mo.us/news/Pages/041114Rockwood-Hires-New-Administrators-.aspx" target="_blank">The new board hired Ms. Dotta as Director of Professional Learning within 72 hours of the election</a>.</p>
<p>I expect Ms. Dotta to teach Rockwood's professionals how to game the system for personal gain at taxpayer expense.</p>
<p>If you'd like to question this apparent <em>quid pro quo</em>, the next Rockwood Board meeting is April 24. &nbsp;Meetings are held at Crestview Middle School, located at 16025 Clayton Road in Ellisville.&nbsp; Meetings begin at 7:00&nbsp;p.m.</p>
