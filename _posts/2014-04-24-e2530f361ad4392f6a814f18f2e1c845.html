<p>Regarding this article:<br />
http://hennessysview.com/2014/04/12/governments-surrender-cliven-bundy-destroys-talebs-weak-argument-gun-control/</p>
<p>Make no mistake: I am opposed to gun control 100%. However, the fact that the government backed down does not imply that it was overpowered. Uncle Sam has a formidable military at its disposal and contrary to populist belief, armed militias would be no match for the US government in an full blown war. I am suprised there was no declaration of martial law. And I happen to know that when this sort of thing was tried during Bush Sr and Clinton's presidency the government went in an pulverized its opponents. Perhaps this was an olive branch from Obama to the American people to suggest that he is really a nice guy. Pretty sure the next president would never allow this to happen.<br />
