<p>Dear Mr. Hennessy,<br />
I have been reading your stuff for a while. I am an old Tea Party guy. I gave the Jefferson County Tea party office space in one of my buildings when Ken Horton was in charge. They still use the space.<br />
Now we rarely meet.  The steam is gone.  We were a mighty little group for a while.  What happened?<br />
When we meet everybody is at least 60. Where are the young people?<br />
The bad guys come at us from so many directions at once it tires the soul.<br />
Saul Alinsky was right, and Obama is following his message perfectly. What a shame that it is working so well.<br />
Do have any thoughts on how to re start a group like ours?<br />
We might as well not meet. nothing happens.<br />
I will continue reading you.<br />
Regards,<br />
John W Wightman<br />
