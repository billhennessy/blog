  content: Sounds like a marvelous idea Bill ! Gen X'er here and couldn't agree more.
    I stood beside you many times back in 2009-2010. You got it, Andrew got it, but
    way too many around you 2 didn't and it fractured us. The collaboration of these
    2 groups could very well be the thing that saves our constitutional society.

<p>I'm <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/anti-establishment-parties-claim-big-wins-in-european-parliamentary-vote/2014/05/25/73e84fe1-ed5e-47fb-bc0e-d6626e861f3d_story.html" target="_blank">totally envious of Europe</a>, and I think two American generations can fix it for me.</p>
<p>Gen X (born ~1961 to ~1981) is a thoroughly anti-authority generation. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/poll-millenials-have-historically-low-levels-of-trust-in-government-2014-4" target="_blank">Millennial (born ~1982 to ~2002) is a completely anti-institutional generation</a>.</p>
<p>It's time for these great generations to get together and form an anti-establishment movement. Maybe even a party.</p>
<p>Check this out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">A new poll surveying young Americans' political attitudes released by Harvard University's Institute of Politics Tuesday found <strong>millennials have less trust in government than ever before</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Read more:&nbsp;<a style="color: #003399;" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/poll-millenials-have-historically-low-levels-of-trust-in-government-2014-4#ixzz32lyajNI8">http://www.businessinsider.com/poll-millenials-have-historically-low-levels-of-trust-in-government-2014-4#ixzz32lyajNI8</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>To an anti-authority, liberty-loving Gen Xer, that's the most beautiful paragraph in the history of polling literature. As Pete Townsend said, "the kids are alright!"</p>
<p>Not that the Millennial folk will listen to me, but I gotta say they're 100% right in distrusting government. The US government, their state government, their&nbsp;school board. Every level of government is a trough that big corporations fill for the satisfaction of the elected swine. Government's like a big pig farm.</p>
<p>Last night, I took my son Patrick to Ballpark Village on our way home from Fast Eddie's Bon Air. <a title="When Did It Get So Late?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/05/24/get-late/">&nbsp;It was his 21st birthday</a>. BPV is an awesome place, but it was bought with taxpayer dollars--and without taxpayer input. In other words, Fox Sports Midwest and the DeWitt family stole Missouri's ATM card and PIN and withdrew 19 million of your tax dollars to build an amazing sports and drink palace.</p>
<p>The DeWitts (and others) get the profits; you get the costs. Wonderful.</p>
<p>That's an example of why Millennials think government is the cousin of lies. And that's why America needs an anti-establishment movement, if not an anti-establishment party.</p>
<p>This movement or party, or both, will have a very narrow focus: reducing government activity to a few, necessary tasks. Kinda like Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution.</p>
<p>The party will ignore the "issues" establishment uses to keep us divided. Stuff like gay rights and public prayer. Those are important issues, but the establishment uses them to keep us fighting about minutiae while it steals our power and freedom. So we won't play their game.</p>
<p>We won't field our own candidates. Instead, we'll cast negative votes in both establishment parties to deny them their traditional constituencies. Negative votes might include voting for third party candidates or skipping offices where the choice is more of an echo.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we'll use our personal power to influence public officials. We won't harass and protest; we'll smile and converse. We'll lobby like paid lobbyists, even though we're just people.</p>
<p>We've learned our lesson. Yelling at politicians only makes them stronger. We're not doing that anymore. Now, we're talking. And smiling. And connecting.</p>
<p>Look, Gen X and Millennials together are an overwhelming force. We both hate the establishment. Let's get together and destroy it, shall we?</p>
