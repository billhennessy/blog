<p>Have you heard of and/or checked out www.politicalchips.org?  Maybe it's time we forget the Republican party altogether...just like they have forgotten us...</p>
<p>I'm afraid I can't make it to St. Louis on the 19th, so I hope you will carry my idea to the group via this comment.</p>
<p>I'm a CHIPS vettor.  We have quite a group of vettors now in Jeff City, and a handful in the Kansas City, Columbia, and Springfield area.  We are hoping that we will soon have a handful in the SEMO area.  We need some folks in the St. Louis area, however.  This organization changed the face of Kansas.  We are hoping to do the same in Missouri.  Parties don't seem to be getting us the candidates we are looking for, but I think (and pray) CHIPS will.  I do not believe it prudent to count on the party any more than I think it's prudent to count on the gov't to ever again watch out for our best interest.  We must do this ourselves.<br />
