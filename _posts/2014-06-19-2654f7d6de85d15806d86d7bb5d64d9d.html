<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Emily Walsh and I am the Community Outreach Director for the Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance. I am reaching out to you today to ask if you wanted to participate in our summer campaign, by taking a moment for mesothelioma, a rare cancer that is caused by exposure to asbestos. Asbestos is a dangerous material not banned in the US, and has been used throughout the U.S. military in hundreds of applications including naval ships, military buildings, vehicles, etc. </p>
<p>Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer that has a long latency period, and symptoms may not manifest until the cancer reaches the later stages making most diagnoses rather grim. But through every struggle there can be strength, as witnessed through Heather Von St. James, an eight year mesothelioma cancer survivor, blogger, and advocate for this preventable disease. Heather, along with the rest of my team at the Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance have worked to make to make our site the best resource for patients, families, and individuals wanting to learn more about the disease. </p>
<p>During this campaign our goal is to educate people throughout the summer in hopes that our efforts could help ban the use of asbestos in the US! If you are interested in &ldquo;taking a moment for meso&rdquo; and helping us reach our goal please let me know! Every voice has the power to spread hope and make a difference for those in need!</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you!</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Emily<br />
