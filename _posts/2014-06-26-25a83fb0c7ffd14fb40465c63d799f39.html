<p>Hello Bill,</p>
<p>Matt Smith here, Producer of the film SPANISH LAKE, currently playing at the Tivoli. I am not sure if you are aware of the film, but we have been causing a much needed conversation on the trouble the federal govt brings with certain policies, and how these policies have effected so many areas within St. Louis, but even across the entire US. Our focus discuss the process of &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; brought on by the way govt&rsquo; chooses to zone areas, ultimately taking total control of these townships that remain unincorporated because they want less govt. It&rsquo;s not right, and Spanish Lake is a prime example of that. We have seen this take place in dozens of cities, and so we feel awareness is the only way to make change.  Fellow Tea Party Americans have been supporting the controversial documentary, and we would love if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind speaking to your group and getting people aware of the film. We have had a great turn out so far, but we want to take the film beyond St. Louis, and continue the message. </p>
<p>Currently we are scheduled at the Tivoli through July 3rd, but if we continue to have strong turn out, they will keep us there, and we can show them we are being heard!</p>
<p>Thank you for any support!<br />
Best,</p>

<p>Spanish Lake slated for release in July 10th 2014. </p>
<p>Los Angeles, CA - A new and racially-charged documentary argues that the social phenomenon of &ldquo;white flight,&rdquo; a term for when a predominately white neighborhood flips to a predominately black one, is largely the result of federal government policies. It has been labeled, &ldquo;The most controversial documentary of the year.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In May, director Phillip Andrew Morton and producer Matt Jordan Smith sat down with the head staff of H.U.D. in Washington D.C. to discuss their new film, Spanish Lake, which attracted their attention due to its assertions that a saturation of Section 8 housing and real estate steering were responsible for the mass exodus of thousands of St. Louis residents during the late 1990s.<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve interviewed several political heavy-hitters for the film,&rdquo; says Morton. &ldquo;One of those interviews was with a former high-level H.U.D. employee, and that triggered the federal government interest. I wasn&rsquo;t sure they would appreciate the film.&rdquo; </p>
<p>U.S. Census Bureau statistics reveal an 80% decline in white residents in Spanish Lake since 1990. The community was decimated by unscrupulous real estate firms, who conspired in scaring many white families into selling their houses. Those houses were then marked up and sold to minority families for a profit. Meanwhile, the exodus of white families resettled in newly built subdivisions for further profiteering by real estate developers.<br />
"The economic decline of the area comes mostly as a result of failed federal government policies. Spanish Lake was racially segregated by design,&rdquo; says producer Smith. </p>
<p>The candid and passionate talk of race by those interviewed in the film is bold and unsettling. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with black people, it&rsquo;s just n**gers,&rdquo; says a man in the trailer to the film, which is downright chilling. Emotions by residents run high, yet the film remains unbiased in its execution, and it allows the audience to decide for themselves who was at fault for the &ldquo;flight.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Spanish Lake, due July 10th in limited release in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, is already drawing large crowds in St. Louis, where it was released on June 13th to strong reviews and intense media coverage. Tickets in other cities here: http://bit.ly/1nIWrae</p>
<p>Many of the interview subjects in Spanish Lake were culled through Facebook by the film's director, who himself was born and raised there. The project sparked local media interest and raised $20,000 in pledges via a successful Kickstarter campaign. (http:// www.kickstarter.com/projects/phillipandrewmorton/spanish-lake).<br />
Cities that have encountered population shifts due to &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; will find much to relate to in the documentary. </p>
