  content: "Bill, thanks for mentioning the campaigns of third party/independent candidates
    in Missouri. There are many others of us running around the country in the 2014
    mid terms because we recognize that the time has come to boot out the Ds and the
    Rs and their heavy-hitting 'sponsors.' I'm not willing to live in a plutocracy
    under a new form of taxation without representation; I think most of us are in
    the same mindset. \r\n\r\nI read blogs and social media posts talking about the
    importance of voting for independents and casting aside the two-party system,
    but few bother to talk about the candidates. Without those who are willing to
    run, it's all for naught. I appreciate that you recognize the importance of PEOPLE
    in the process! \r\n\r\n(In your introductory comments, is there a link missing
    for a Politico comment?)"

  content: Thanks for researching the alternative candidates running in MO.  You are
    right - we do have a choice other than the incumbent.

  content: Voting for a 3rd party candidate is really going to work. Democrats stay
    in power and all we have to do is complain that nobody does anything or nothing
    ever changes. Pretty disappointing Bill. Reading through the comments of the people
    you listed, there are some pretty good thoughts and convictions. If these guys
    really feel as they say, they should run in one of the major party primaries.
    It is a cop-out to run as a 3rd party candidate because you know that you will
    never win and you do not have to put your money where your mouth is. I for one
    believe that it will take years to change the political establishment, we need
    to do it from the ground up and it will take more than two election cycles.

  content: Thank you Freida.   Could have not put it better.    Voters need to research
    the Candidates they plan on voting for.  They may not be what and who you want
    elected.

  content: "A lot of people don't vote because neither party reflects their views.
    While Libertarian and Independent candidates might not be likely to win a race,
    I do want people to know there are other choices out there.\r\n\r\nAlso, if liberty
    and freedom and constitutionally limited government matter, I don't think we're
    going to get it from Republicans. As we saw in Mississippi, the Republican establishment
    will do anything to preserve its power. In Missouri, <a href=\"http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/04/chamber-royale/\"
    title=\"Chamber Royale\" rel=\"nofollow\">the GOP establishment is pouring money
    and prestige into legislative races to get Obamacare Medicaid expansion through
    the legislature</a>, and it will gladly see a Democrat win here and there than
    deny itself access to the Missouri Hospital Association's political money. \r\n\r\nAs
    long as the GOP knows we will support its candidates no matter what they do, they
    have no incentive to reform. I'm no longer willing to deny them that incentive."

<p>How many times have you thought, "I really don't care for the Republican, but I'll never vote for a Democrat?"</p>
<p>How does that thought make you feel? Weak or strong? Impotent or powerful? Eager or dispirited?</p>
<p>Do you know why you feel forced to choose between the lesser of two evils?</p>
<p>Because you want to.</p>
<p>In almost every race, you have more than two choices. In the 2014 US House elections in Missouri, ballots in&nbsp;all&nbsp;eight&nbsp;districts&nbsp;will have a Libertarian or independent candidate, or both.</p>
<p>I'm not saying to cast a knee-jerk vote for a third party candidate. I am saying not to cast a knee-jerk for a Republican or Democrat. Take a look at your choices. Tell your friends who don't vote that they don't have to settle for the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>To help spread the word about your choices, here's what I could find about some non-traditional party candidates who might be more appealing than the candidates chosen for you by the political elite. Or, as Politico put it</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: inherit; color: #606060;">2nd District:&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #117bb8;" href="http://www.billslantz.com/_index.php" target="_blank">Bill Slantz, Libertarian</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;">I believe in a limited government. Individuals should be free to make choices for themselves and accept responsibility for the choices they make. The Libertarian way approaches politics based on the principle of self-ownership &mdash; no group, government nor individual should be allowed to dictate or direct the life of any other group, government or individual.</span><br style="color: #333333;" /><br style="color: #333333;" /><span style="color: #333333;">As a proud Libertarian, I believe not only in a free market, but also in the free marketplace of ideas. We poorly represent the voice and will of the people when we restrict conversation only to those affiliated with a Republican or Democratic Party. We need fresh, independent voices if we are to rid our government offices of &ldquo;politics as usual&rdquo; in Missouri and beyond.</span></p>

<h3 style="font-weight: inherit; color: #606060;">3rd District:&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #117bb8;" href="http://votethefuture.com/" target="_blank">Steven Hedrick, Libertarian</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">I could go to school for 50 years and never understand&nbsp;half of the things our government does and we have<br />
no say in what they are doing to us. If this is a free&nbsp;country, shouldn't we be making the decisions instead<br />
of people that we elect thinking they are going to be&nbsp;honest when they just want to get elected? I think we<br />
should have more freedoms that are not overran by our&nbsp;governments laws because after all, isn't that what are&nbsp;forefathers wanted for us? This is not going to be a&nbsp;free country until we make a stand and get our<br />
freedoms back that have been taken over by our&nbsp;government. It is your call, but I think we should make<br />
a stand together so we can be free!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BTW, Blaine Luetkemeyer, the 3rd District incumbent, is the mother of all crony capitalists in Congress. This seat needs a new face in 2014.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: inherit; color: #606060;">3rd District:&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #117bb8;" href="http://harolddavisforcongress.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Harold Davis, Write-in</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;"><span style="color: #000000;">I REALLY WANT YOU to send me to the House of Representatives. THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT! &nbsp;Because I know you're frustrated with Gov't. and I hear you say there's nothing you can do. WELL NOW THERE IS! &nbsp;AND YOU MUST ACT! &nbsp;IF you don't, it's pretty simple and obvious, nothing much will change. Take action is just a catch phrase unless YOU put out effort. I have offered to disrupt my life for CIVIC DUTY, so must YOU, to REGISTER TO VOTE &nbsp;AND VOTE, WRITE MY NAME ON THE BALLOT</span></p>

<h3 style="font-weight: inherit; color: #606060;">5th District: Roy Welborn, Libertarian</h3>
<blockquote><p>Over my job career I have done so many different things from fast food when I was younger, to construction, and finally for the past 30 years I have been in the Computer industry in various roles from Programmer, to Systems administrator. I have been dead broke, I have wondered at times where my next meal has come from, and I have been lower middle class blue collar/white collar all my life. So I know the plight of the middle class with struggling to pay for bills, gas, and food with what little money I brought in.</p>
<p>I have never held a public office not even in high school, and that is one reason why I think I would make a great person to choose for congress, I know when to call bullcrap, and I am very outspoken regarding what is wrong, right, and simply none of the governments business. If I am graced with being elected will not change.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;">One of the first things that I will do when elected is introduce legislation to eliminate federal funding of state, county, and local police forces. Yes, this will save the taxpayer money (about $700 billion since 9/11), but I am much more concerned about saving our civil liberties. There are too many cops, too many jails, too many drones, too many armored vehicles, too many SWAT teams, too many machine guns, and TOO MANY DAMN LAWS!!!</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;"><strong style="color: #000000;">IT'S TIME FOR INDEPENDENTS</strong><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><strong style="color: #000000;">A New Way of Thinking about How We Are Governed</strong><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">You and I have to do something different if we expect different political results. It's time for us to say to the Republican and Democratic parties, "We're leaving." These parties don't support us. Why are we supporting them?&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">A Gallup poll from January 12, 2012 says that Independents make up the largest political group in the country. Yet in the current House, membership is 54% Republican and 46% Democrat. Congress doesn't look like or act like us because it is not like us.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">You deserve a new kind of voice, not another politician who knows his or her way around the political system, the system that has failed us and our country.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><strong style="color: #000000;">Don't Vote for Power and Money</strong><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">It's nearly impossible for politicians who get tangled up in the party system to not lose their way. The lure of party power is strong. But the price they pay is giving up their souls to the party line.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Representatives elected by political party power, or by special interest money, owe their allegiance to whoever paid their way. Our current representatives don't answer to you and me. They answer to their parties and to money.</span></p>

<p>Aside: I with all the candidates profiled here would check out Terry Hampton's excellent, professional website. One reason non-establishment candidates struggle is they don't do the basics right. Terry does. A high-quality, professional looking website is not expensive or difficult today. If candidates want people to take them seriously, they need to follow Terry's lead on website design and content strategy.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: inherit; color: #606060;">&nbsp;Learn More About Your Choices</h3>
<p>No one can use the "lesser of two evils" excuse for staying home in 2014. I know people think that voting for a third party is wasting a vote. So is not voting at all.</p>
<p><em style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: italic;">Note: I offered to profile three other candidates who did not respond to my request for information and whose websites lacked sufficient background to include in this post. And then I received Roy Welborn's info, which I've added.</em></p>
