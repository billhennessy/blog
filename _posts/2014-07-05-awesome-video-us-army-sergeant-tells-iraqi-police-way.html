  content: Jack, thank you for your continued service to our country, in spite of
    the fact that you're probably not even sure if you'll get the medical care required
    should you become injured. You, my man, deserve our respect and thanks everyday!
    And Bill, thank you for rearing a fine young man like Jack! You and your wife
    are patriots! God Bless America! PS That sergeant was f@#% ing awesome! Why should
    our American brave die for Iraqi cowards?

  content: "Out-f%#@ing-Standing, Sergeant! That's laying it on the line and telling
    it like it is! As a veteran, I was dressed down many times during my training
    while standing in a formation just like that and it got MY attention! \r\n\r\nBill,
    your comments on the realities of War and the preparation of the military to fight
    it are absolutely correct. It's not a game for the convenience of politicians
    or a tabletop exercise for \"Armchair Generals\"that is fought by remote control
    or by someone else doing your job for you. It is fought and won by whichever side
    has more \"boots on the ground\" that are motivated to fight and if necessary,
    die for what it is they are trying to defend. Like the South Vietnamese, the Iraqi
    military foisted that responsibility on us and sadly, I fear the results will
    be the same.\r\n\r\nAnd congratulations to Jack for his service thus far and his
    decision to re-up. Like my son in the Marines, he gives me hope for my country
    that there are still men and women like them in their generation that answer the
    call of Duty, Honor, Country. We might just make it, thanks to them!"

<p>I love this video. And I'm going to ask you a small favor for my son Jack, so please read all.</p>
<p>WARNING: Strong Language</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj6AXvkBnv4</p>
<h3>What's So Great About It?</h3>
<p>You have to love this American Army sergeant telling the Iraqi police how it is in strong language. Perhaps if the Iraqi police had listened, they wouldn't be defending Baghdad against the Islamic State right now.</p>
<p>But they are.</p>
<p>I know some of you might object to this sergeant's direct assault on these men's manhood and character. Don't be. Like Patton, this sergeant knows these men need to grow spines and to take responsibility for themselves, their comrades, and their country. Not because it's cool, but because evil men will try to take their country--and their lives--from them.</p>
<p>This sergeant deserves a medal.</p>
<h3>If You Don't Get the Sergeant's Speech, You Don't Understand War</h3>
<p>People who've never served might not understand that war is violent. The purpose of war is to break an enemy's will to fight, to break down an enemy's psyche so thoroughly that the enemy society cannot function without assistance from the victory.</p>
<p>Like the Democratic Party, the propose of war is to make a whole race of people completely dependent on others.</p>
<p>Unlike the Democratic Party, the US military tries to rehabilitate the vanquished society, restore its dignity, and help its people become independent, functioning, proud citizens of their reformed nation.</p>
<p>That means just war is morally superior to the Democrat Party, which Alexis de Tocqueville perfectly described 176 years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications, and to watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild. <strong>It would be like the authority of a parent, if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks on the contrary to keep them in perpetual childhood:</strong> it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided they think of nothing but rejoicing.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Independence Day isn't a furniture sale. It's a commemoration of a nation's rejection of the arbitrary rule of other men. July 4th symbolizes a bold American spirit that, like the sergeant in this video, will risk everything to live as free people, free from the tyranny of unlimited state power.</p>
<p>And some risk more than others.</p>
<p><strong>Now&nbsp;My Real Purpose of This Post</strong></p>
<p>That's why I spent nine years on active duty and nearly three years submerged on a submarine&mdash;to preserve and protect our republic and her people.</p>
<p>And that's why<strong> I'm so proud to tell you my son Jack is re-enlisting today, July 4, on board the USS Missouri in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations, Jack. And congratulations to the US Navy and to the United States.</p>
<p>Now for that small favor.</p>
<p>Would you mind leaving a short note to Jack in the comments of this blog post?</p>
