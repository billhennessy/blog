  content: "Bill,\r\nI also went to see the film on its Wed opening and took a friend.
    It was truly awe-inspiring! At the risk of sounding self-congratulatory, I was
    gratified to see him  address many of the common indictments leveled against America
    by her detractors and use the same arguments and facts that I have had occasion
    to use over the years in my debates with Liberals, Progressives and politically
    correct \"Revisionist\" Historians. \r\n\r\nThe segments on the truth about the
    \"Reconquista\" efforts by Mexican claims to the US Southwest, the displacement
    of Native Americans by a technologically advanced migration of European immigrants
    not being unprecidented in world history, (not to mention the fact that the tribes
    were displacing, conquering and enslaving each other prior to the European arrival)
    and shock of shocks, Slavery was not invented here!\r\n\r\nWhile it is not nearly
    as \"political\" as his \"2016\" movie, there are a couple of well-aimed barbs
    at Obama,  his policies and beliefs and an especially enlightening aside about
    Hillary's early political evolution. It is a very uplifting film and makes one
    proud to be an American. It also encourages one to take seriously the threats
    to our way of life and to rally to the defense of our Country and the Constitution.
    Highly recommended!"

<p>What if America didn't exist?</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/05/saw-dinesh-dsouzas-america-now/america_the_movie/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-14919"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14919" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/america_the_movie.png" alt="america_the_movie" width="1000" height="238" /></a></p>
<p>That's the premise of <a href="http://www.americathemovie.com/" target="_blank">Dinesh D'Souza's new movie&nbsp;</a><em><a href="http://www.americathemovie.com/" target="_blank">America: Imagine the&nbsp;world without her</a>.</em>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.fandango.com/america_174736/movietimes?location=63011" target="_blank">Find a theatre near you</a>.)</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, my wife took Samantha, Jordan, and me to see the movie to kick off Independence Day weekend. Even without the movie, this July 4th was special for me. My son, <a title="2 Awesome Military Stories for Independence Day Weekend" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/05/awesome-video-us-army-sergeant-tells-iraqi-police-way/">Jack, re-enlisted in the US Navy on board the USS Missouri in Pearl Harbor</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, the holiday gives me a welcomed break from a hectic month at work. And there's parties to go to and the finest 4th of July weather St. Louis has had in a long time--since 1997, if memory serves.</p>
<p>But I'm going to ask you to take someone to see America: Imagine the world without her. You'll probably learn something new and important no matter how much you read.</p>
<p>For example, does the name Madame C. J. Walker mean anything to you? It should. If not, D'Souza will fill you in by answering the question, "Why don't we ever hear about America's first self-made millionairess?" The answer will surprise you.</p>
<p>Something else I learned&mdash;well, confirmed: Hillary Clinton is ideologically closer to Barack Obama than she is to her husband Bill.</p>
<p>I know Dinesh D'Souza's had some issues with hubris of late, but that's all the more reason to see America. He confronts his problems and points out how the Obama administration uses its power to reward friends and crush enemies.</p>
<p>In the end, America is about the real battle for liberty. America is liberty's last and greatest hope. If liberty dies here, there's no place else to run to.</p>
<p>The more people see America by D'Souza, the better the odds that liberty will prevail.</p>
