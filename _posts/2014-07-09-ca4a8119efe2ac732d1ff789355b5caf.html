<p>Okeh, I took the test you offered in your article "I Am a Right-Leaning Libertarian", and it claims I'm also such. I answered 'Maybe' to the national ID question. giving me a 90% score in that category. I got 100% on matters economic. However, I will never call myself 'Libertarian" as I am 100% pro-life and they are not. I am a freeborn American - freeborn for short, if you seek a catchy label. In 2012, I voted for the Constitution Party candidate every time one appeared on the ballot, and have no reason not to in the future.<br />
