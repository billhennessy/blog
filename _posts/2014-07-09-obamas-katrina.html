<p><strong>Visuals</strong>: Some of the thousands of children suffering in a humanitarian disaster at the US border on the top&nbsp;of the split screen. On the bottom, President Obama drinking beer and shooting pool with locals 246 miles away.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/09/obamas-katrina/crisis-management-obama/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-14944"><img class="alignright wp-image-14944 " src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/crisis-management-obama.png" alt="crisis-management-obama" width="380" height="259" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/07/09/Obama-Happy-to-Consider-Deploying-National-Guard-to-Border" target="_blank"><strong>Audio</strong></a>: President on deploying National Guard to alleviate humanitarian crisis: "I'd be happy to consider it," but it would be "a temporary solution."</p>
<p><strong>Face it</strong>: the press was going to blame George Bush for Katrina no matter what. That's what the press does. I understand that.</p>
<p>But the Bush administration's handling of the post-Katrina crisis was a visual disaster on par with the humanitarian disaster.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though. This isn't a critique of post-Katrina actions. It's an observation of Obama's handling of the what's going on with the flood of illegals.</p>
<h3>The Border Crisis is Obama's Katrina.</h3>
<p>First, Obama's actions led led to the crisis. As we used to say during the Reagan Administration, ideas have consequences. As <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/06/12/Cruz-on-Fox-Border-Crisis-for-Kids-a-Result-of-Obama-Message" target="_blank">Senator Ted Cruz told Fox News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #111111;">It's important to understand what causes this&hellip; President Obama unilaterally and illegally granted amnesty to some 800,000 people who were here illegally who came as children.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I'll say it again: no reasonable person will deny that the humanitarian disaster along the US Southern border is a disaster the President asked for.</p>
<p>And the crisis threatens to swamp the scale of Katrina.</p>
<h3>Cautious Prediction</h3>
<p>Obama's smug arrogance and complete lack of urgency or compassion for the children dumped on America's door step <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/09/obamas-katrina/obama-smug/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-14949"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14949" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Obama-Smug-300x200.jpg" alt="Obama Smug" width="300" height="200" /></a>borders on pathological. The crisis reveals Obama as a psychopath. If he really doesn't care, he's an indifferent&nbsp;psychopath. If the border disaster is a Cloward-Pivens tactic, he's a power-hungry psychopath. Obama has no path out that doesn't lead through the psychopathic jungle.</p>
<p>A glance at the mainstream media tells me that Obama's amen chorus is ready to abandon their former hero. But I could be wrong, and it wouldn't be the first time.</p>
<p>No matter what, Obama's psychopathy is undeniable.</p>
