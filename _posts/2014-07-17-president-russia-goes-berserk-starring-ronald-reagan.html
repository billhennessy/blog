  content: "Absolutely incredible...listening to this really drives home the fact
    that this country has not had a leader since this great man left office.  This
    video makes me proud of this country but equally pissed it's state of affairs.
    \r\nThanks for sharing this Billy."

  content: Well done and Thank You, Bill. Only missed being the most classic example
    ever of "Throw Back Thursday" by one day! This almost brought a tear to my eye
    as I was reminded of Reagan's leadership and then compared it to what we have
    been brought down to today. Will the American people ever again fit the description
    given by Japanese Admiral Yamamoto when informed that his attack on Pearl Harbor
    was without warning, "I fear that all we have done is to Awaken a Sleeping Giant
    and Fill Him with a Terrible Resolve!"?
