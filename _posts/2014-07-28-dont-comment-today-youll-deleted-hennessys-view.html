  content: Me too! Bill, I had to unsubscribe from this and other blogs,  due to too
    much email! But I bookmarked this one to check in regularly. Does this mean no
    more sign-in to comment from other services? It's also a way to help confuse tracking!
    Select posts are subscribed through Wordpress! Do NOT make me cry! I love you!

<p>If you registered as a user but never commented AND you want to continue getting an email notification when new blogs are posted, all you have to do is <strong>COMMENT on this blog</strong>. Say anything, like "don't delete me, bro."</p>
<p>Here's why: my blog has about 8,000 registered users. That sounds great, I know, but it's not. <strong>Most of these registered users are zombies</strong>. They were created by a spam bot so the bot could post spam comments.</p>
<p>These zombie users slow down the sight for everyone, and they present a security risk. Plus, they prevent me from implementing a cool new newsletter feature I'll tell you more about in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>I am going to delete every user who has never commented on this blog on Tuesday, July 29 at 6:00 pm. </strong><br />
<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/28/dont-comment-today-youll-deleted-hennessys-view/zombie02/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-15040"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15040 size-large" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/zombie02-1024x576.jpg" alt="Zombies" width="700" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>So why aren't there a bunch of spammy comments with all these zombies hanging around? Good question. I use Akismet spam blocker to block spam comments. But I require commenters to be registered users. While Akismet stops the comments, it doesn't stop the registration spammers.</p>
<p>After I clean up the zombies, I'm going to install software to block new zombie users, but that won't affect you.</p>
<p>Once again, <strong>if you want to remain on my email list and able to comment, you must comment by 6:00 pm CDT on Tuesday, July 28, 2014.</strong></p>
<p>If you get deleted, just re-register. I hope you do.</p>
<p>And if you haven't registered, I recommend making a note on your calendar to do so AFTER Tuesday.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Bill</p>
