<p>Bill,</p>
<p>I have episodically followed you, and found your web content thoughtful and interesting.  Many is the time I might have commented on your posts, especially recently.  Wordpress and I are not "getting along" just now and life is getting busier for me since I'm running for a county office (county clerk.)  Federal and even state politics are mesmerizing and apocalyptic, but Phelps County is in my bailiwick, and not that of so many others with good ideas for remedying what ails us at higher levels.  So I will concentrate on the county for now.</p>
<p>I don't like the idea of being lumped in with the bots, trolls, and zombies, but go ahead and delete; I meanwhile shake the dust off my feet as I leave Wordpress, as this pentagenarian simply lacks the bandwidth to troubleshoot the problem.  Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>For Liberty,</p>
<p>Pamela K. Grow, M.D.<br />
