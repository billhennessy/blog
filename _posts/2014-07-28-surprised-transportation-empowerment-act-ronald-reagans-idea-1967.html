<p>Last week I blogged that <a title="Video: Ronald Reagan Wants the Transportation Empowerment Act" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/13/ronald-reagan-wants-transportation-empowerment-act/" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan would love the Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA)</a>. I included audio of Reagan talking to Bill Buckley on Firing Line about the burden on states from onerous federal taxes and grants.</p>
<p>Forgive me, but that was sort of a tease. Here's the meat: Reagan wrote a proposal for the Republican Governors' Conference of 1967 to allow states to keep &nbsp;about 2 percent of all&nbsp;federal&nbsp;taxes raised in the state. Ninety-eight percent would still go to Washington for defense and studies of monkey sex lives and whatever they do with money up there, but the states would retain two percent.</p>
<p>Here's the Gipper:</p>

<p>Now, please <a href="http://wagner.house.gov/contact/offices" target="_blank">call Ann Wagner's Ballwin office</a> and ask her to co-sponsor TEA. It'll help her Heritage Action Score.</p>
<p>The Transportation Empowerment Act is<a title="What Francis Slay Won&rsquo;t Tell You About Missouri Roads&mdash;VIDEO" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/26/francis-slay-wont-tell-missouri-roads/"> the right way to deal with Missouri's overwhelming bike path problems</a> and provides a <a title="Francis Slay Destroys the Transportation Sales Tax Trying to Support It **UPDATE**" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/15/francis-slay-destroys-transportation-sales-tax-trying-support/">smart alternative to the biggest tax increase in Missouri's history</a>.</p>
