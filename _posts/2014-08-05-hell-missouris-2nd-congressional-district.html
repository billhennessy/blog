  content: I believe the numbers may be skewed due to some Republicans crossing over
    to vote for Stenger over Dooley to make sure Dooley is GONE. Then again, Wagner
    is an Establishment Republican and recently voted for an anti-gun bill.

  content: She is too Democrat Lite for me, I am more of a full flavor Conservative
    ( a Samual Adams if you will). That is why I wouldn't give her my vote.  Don't
    know when these politicians will figure it out that we don't like when they dicker
    around in the duplicitous muck? She might try and buy a six pack of Reagan Pale
    Ale...it seems to do the trick.  Hmmm, I'm craving a beer.

  content: So give the election to a Dems.? This is how we lost  in 2012 bone heads!
    Boy are some played by the system! Or are some just plain too stubborn to save
    America. You simply play with the cards you are dealt with! I do not give a rat's
    behind about personal principles...this goes far beyond that in votes. Ya think
    today's Dems will work better for us?

  content: Wagner has been a terrible Representative! The longer she stays in office
    the more powerful she gets and we will never get rid of her. She raised over a
    million bucks this year for her re-election campaign. When McCaskill is up I wouldn't
    doubt Wagner runs. Than what would we have? Another Roy Blunt. No thanks. If she
    loses this year best chance for a conservative to run in 2016.

  content: "I heard several say they might vote D in lieu of R for the Dooley switch.
    They assume the County position will stay Dem. AnnW: I know of several Dem households
    that moved from the Dem north county to Ballwin - there are at least 3 votes right
    there. The demographics are changing. Families that can move from failing school
    districts will move toward Dist 2. \r\nSo, A: We have to help the R win the county
    ex seat. and 2:  Communicate with Ann, which means B: figure out how to influence
    the local GOP positions.\r\n\r\nFor the long range, consider this:\r\n\r\nThe
    right to farm results: Yes  (yeah! Smile)\r\n \r\nIt was so close that you can
    see that every vote matters. 2528 / 114 counties + city of St Louis = 21.9 votes
    per county . If half of those  (11 or 12 people) in each county had voted no,
    the result would have been reverse. \r\n \r\nFast forward to all the incoming
    illegal children, if distributed around the USA by approx. 20 to each county (
    as proposed by someone in Washington on TV) &ndash;  there&rsquo;s the swing in
    the results........."

  content: "Ann Wagner is too much of a RINO.  She seems to be currying favor with
    Establishment Repubs at the national level.  At the grass roots, where I am active
    there is a very strong TEA Party mind set.  And Ann Wagner is not meeting their
    view.  \r\n\r\nWhile I respect her husbands right to support a Dem,  his outright
    public endorsement of Charlie Dooley was really galling to us in the South County.\r\n\r\nNow,
    Jennifer Bird would make a great US Representative.  She needs to get more experience.
    \ And we will work to give her that opportunity.  She needs a win for County Council."

  content: I agree with comments of others before me.  I have written more than once
    and receive a standard "thanks for your letter, comments, etc. We'll get back
    to you shortly.  I'm still waiting months later.  Yes, she's part of the problem
    and shows no signs of becoming a solution.  I did not vote for her --left it blank
    as i will do in November unless I see evidence that she's actually going to represent
    the people who put her in office.

<p>No time for deep analysis tonight, but there's a small political earthquake in St. Louis County.</p>
<p>With over 90% of the precincts counted in the Missouri primary, incumbent Congresswoman Ann Wagner has only 500 more votes than her November challenger, Democrat Arthur Lieber.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mo-2-primary.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15164 size-large" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mo-2-primary-1024x506.png" alt="mo-2-primary" width="700" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>I get that this is a primary and that the St. Louis County Executive race drew a lot of attention. But Wagner won her seat in 2012 by 20 points. And polls show that <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/2014-midterms-voter-enthusiasm-poll-106571.html" target="_blank">Democrat voter enthusiasm is down 23 percent</a> from 2012.</p>
<p>Assuming the Dooley-Stenger race overcame half that Dem enthusiasm deficit, Wagner should have received about 15,000 more votes than Lieber.</p>
<p>Adding to my curiosity about this race is a story today that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/05/a-majority-of-people-dont-like-their-own-congressman-for-the-first-time-ever/" target="_blank">voter approval of their own member of Congress is at an all time low</a> with 51 percent disapproving of the job their own Congressperson is doing.</p>
<p>If the MO-2 results hold up, this November could be a shocker for incumbents, which means the GOP's House majority could be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Buckle up.</p>
