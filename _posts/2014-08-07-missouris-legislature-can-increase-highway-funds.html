  content: In 2017, when MoDOT is forced to shut down Missouri bridges (that is going
    to happen unless there is additional funding made available) and therefore Missouri
    roads, it will be too late to discover our roads are not so great after-all.  Bill,
    I'm sure your proposal above to involve more gutless, ineffective members of the
    political class will be great comfort to those who will have to go all the way
    around to get to the other side of the bridge.

  content: I like the idea and tried to use your link for Diehl (It's not working).  Since
    we haven't done away with the 17th Amendment - it may be a way to rattle the chains
    of our US Reps and Senators.  Since you mentioned Blunt, that reminds me . . .
    we really have to start looking for his replacement.

  content: I like Ben's idea. But I am thinking that we need to defeat Diehl. Did
    you see how close his opponent got in the vote count? It could be done.

  content: "Thanks, Frieda.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that St. Louis County Republicans are
    in trouble, and I think part of it can be blamed on the RNC and the Republican
    Establishment. Guys like Mitch McConnell have been telling grassroots, free-market
    conservatives they're not wanted. \r\n\r\nWe have two posts that should be ready
    Sunday afternoon showing that the St. Louis County GOP is facing a fight for its
    life as a growing number of Tea Partiers accept that we're simply not wanted in
    their party."

<p>Now that Amendment 7 has gone down in flames, let's look at highway funding in Missouri.<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/House-res-45680001.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15184" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/House-res-45680001-215x300.jpg" alt="House-res-45680001" width="215" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Amendment 7 would have authorized a 3/4 cent sales tax increase in Missouri. The money was intended for transportation in the broadest sense of the word. <a title="Francis Slay Destroys the Transportation Sales Tax Trying to Support It **UPDATE**" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/15/francis-slay-destroys-transportation-sales-tax-trying-support/" target="_blank">Parks with dirt paths qualify, since people can walk on the paths</a>. Even if the bill tightened down the definition of transportation, municipalities and counties would have merely shifted funds to other projects and replaced that money with Amendment 7 taxes. Politicians are masters at moving money around.</p>
<p>I've <a title="What Francis Slay Won&rsquo;t Tell You About Missouri Roads&mdash;VIDEO" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/26/francis-slay-wont-tell-missouri-roads/" target="_blank">pointed out before that Missouri has great roads</a>. Some of the best in the country. But let's say Amendment 7's supporters were right. Say we need more money for roads and bridges and butterfly museums. Now what?</p>
<p>My buddy <a href="http://heritageaction.com/" target="_blank">Ben Evans of Heritage Action</a> has a great&nbsp;idea.<strong> Let the Missouri Legislature pass resolutions advising our Congressional delegation of what to do and how to vote.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The first resolution I'd&nbsp;propose involves highway funding. The legislature should tell our members of Congress to<strong> co-sponsor and pass the <a title="Surprised? Transportation Empowerment Act Was Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s Idea&mdash;In 1967!" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/28/surprised-transportation-empowerment-act-ronald-reagans-idea-1967/" target="_blank">Transportation Empowerment Act</a></strong>. You can read all about the <a title="Video: Ronald Reagan Wants the Transportation Empowerment Act" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/13/ronald-reagan-wants-transportation-empowerment-act/" target="_blank">TEA here</a>.</p>
<p>The Congressional delegation could just ignore the legislature's recommendation, of course. The resolution could not bind them. But the act of formalizing instructions to members of Congress would make it far more difficult for Representatives and Senators to weasel their way out situations.</p>
<p>Could Roy Blunt really claim he understands Missourians' best interest better than a state rep who lives and works with his constituents? Hardly.</p>
<p>If you like this idea, <a href="mailto:John.Diehl@house.mo.gov">please let John Diehl know right away</a>. Ask him to fast-track a resolution on TEA in the first weeks of the next general assembly in January. And thank <a href="https://twitter.com/benevansstl" target="_blank">@benevansstl</a>&nbsp;for the great strategy idea.</p>
<p>Note: I've fixed the link to John Diehl. If it doesn't work, here's his address:&nbsp;John.Diehl@house.mo.gov</p>
