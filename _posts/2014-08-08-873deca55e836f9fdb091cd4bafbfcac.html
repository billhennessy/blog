<p>Did  I  understand correctly  you had  endorsed   constitutional  amendment   9?</p>
<p>To  me  this is sort of like saying if  I have  a house-guest  and   said  house guest  turns   out to be    sought by the police I  am  required to  stand  on  my  guest's  constitutional  right    and  refuse to  allow the police   into  *my*  home  at *my*  discretion   to look for  my guest.  It's not   *his* home.</p>
<p>Every  time I've  ever signed on to,  gotten membership on  or  bought    service  from   some    internet  "service"  there's  always been  boilerplate  TOS   which  has reminded  me that I'm  accessing  someone's  *private*  domain  and  they   may, at their  discretion,  allow    the police to view  anything  that's left  a record  on their  private  servers  or  drives  or  anything else where some  record  in which  police might   be interested may be  lodged.    I've  well-understood this  principle  and that  I'm  a  *guest*   in  these  domains  and the   hardware which  underlies them  and that  it's  someone  else's  private  property.</p>
<p>Evidently   the  majority of  voters---voters who don't  seem to understand this  is not  a direct  mob-rule democracy  and  was never intended to be  one----have  either  never  read  a standard  boilerplate  TOS  or if they did  could not  understand  the principles   therein.  Or they  just  don't  care about  the difference between facts  and   fantasies.</p>
<p>What's  so  great about   delaying   the  apprehension of   another  Maury Troy  Travis?  Police had  already  over-respected    the ferguscum   serial killer's     rights  when they came to his home  in response to  a report of  a  naked woman  running from it  screaming into the night  and    swallowed his  cock-and-bull  story  about     some  bimbo  he'd  picked up  who'd  drugged him and   he woke up  from the  drugging   to find  her  rifling his  wallet  on  top of his  dresser.   At  that point they  should have  called his bluff and    let it be known by those  there presents that he'd just reported  a felony--attempted murder by  poisoning--and that  he could   go with them  voluntarily to the hospital  to  have  evidence collected   from his bloodstream in the investigation of  his  attempted  poisoning  death  or  they  would go  wake up  a judge and get  a warrant,  or  else he could  change his story  and   come up  with something  more plausible   and  maybe   let  them  come in  and look around  so that  he   wouldn't   be  charged with either  filing  a false police report ( no drug in his system )  or  obstructing  an investigation  and   police in the performance of their  duties.   That might have saved  a couple of   crack-whore's  miserable  lives.  I'm sure  they liked  them  even if    you or  I might not.</p>
<p>I  suspect  that by the time  someone  figured out  Travis  had  been the only  one  to download the  map from  mapquest   with which  he'd  taunted police   with the location of the body of  another of his victims   nobody  was  bothering to ask   for  any warrants and    I would hope  mapquest didn't  ask for  any  before coughing  up the  i.p.   of the    fool who downloaded    that map.  He  could have been  torturing some  poor  pathetic  woman out of her  sordid  life  right  at the  moment   that information was being   acquired  and  the difference in time   in  getting   warrants  might  have been the difference  between life and death.  </p>
<p>All this  crap on the internet   is  on  private  networks.  They're  not  even considered to be  regulated     monopolies/utilities.  They're  scarcely  regulated  at  all.   So  why would  anyone  need  a warrant   instead of  just going  and intimidating   some  operator of  such a domain   to  allow  access?</p>
<p>I  owned  a highly controversial  website for awhile.  In fact I'm probably  not allowed in certain  nations  and might be  arrested in some  nations if   I   were to  go into them.   If  the authorities had  come to me  with    any  accusation of  someone    whose  personal information   was on   some part of  my  holdings  of  intellectual  properties  accessible on the internet ( impossible because  I didn't host  any  forums,    I let  yahoo do that for me  and it would have been them  the police  intimidated )   I  would have  surrendered up the   passwords  immediately.</p>
<p>Anyone  who thinks  anything they type, say,  display or  otherwise  submit  to the internet is   in  any   way, shape or form   "private"  is   too idiotic  to be  allowed to  walk around   loose on the streets  without some burly  individual holding the  leash attached to the harness   locked around their  upper torso.   And  in-fact it's  this  sort  of  over-sensitivity  to   the rights of those  whose   own  innate characteristics   would  really   deem   that they  don't    deserve    full human rights--as in   are  liable to be  judged incompetent  and  locked up  or otherwise   have  their  rights   truncated for  the good of society   or  themselves----which  has been  largely  responsible for    many of the incidents which have been  exploited so profitably  by   those  who despise the  2nd Amendment.  More than  their  share of  such  incidents has come out of  Coloweirdo   and  I have   a  funny feeling  it  has  something to do  with their  ultra-liberal  political    climate  there---"liberal" as  in  deluded  liberal  wannabes  who  will  instantly  surrender their  political power to  be  and   impose  liberalism  to   swine who claim  liberalism but are   really  leftist  fascists.</p>
<p>When I was  young  it   was  a shame  on  a family to have someone like  John Hinkley    running around   loose.  It would be  a stigma on his siblings in their  attempts  to   attract  suitble  suitors   or   to  be  suitors.  It would affect other opportunities ( because   it was well known and understood  even   then  that  much of  our  behavior  comes  from heritable traits even if they're not  always  expressed   due to  environmental  influences that turn  genes on or off, though they  only  sensed the  genetic  mechanism  then   while   not really knowing  much abou t it ).   Families  would,  if they had the wherewithal,  have  such   weirdos   committed   to   an institution.  If   they were poorer they might lock them in the attic  and   kindly feed them   on   the odd occasional bucket of  fish-heads or whatever.</p>
<p>And we didn't have  school  shootings  and   other  sensless massacre  situations  which   would be  used by  leftist  fascists  to   try to  concentrate all power in the hands of the government.</p>
<p>Now that the   right  to  fight other   weirdos   for   a berth on the warmest    steam  grate    (instead of  3hots and  a cot  in  whatever  institution   their  families or   the  local taxing authority thought they could afford them )   has been  well established  and we've  jettisoned  the   ideal of  an idiot-free society for  an idiot-proof  society     look  at  what has ensued and look  how  close the  2nd  Amendment has  come   to being  relegated to the  scrap-heap of   history along with  slavery   and   women knowing their   place...</p>
<p>There's  no  "right to privacy"    when you're   guest on  someone else's  private property.  Sorry.  If  you  don't  think you  can trust your host then    "sleep in your clothes".<br />
