  content: It was a gutless, cowardly move. Priebus is Chairman of the RNC and he
    should have been the one to call for an investigation into the sordid Mississippi
    Senate race and hold those responsible for the despicable racist acts. I stand
    with Ed Martin.  If Thad Cochran had any principles he would have retired after
    losing in the primary, after 40+ years in Congress and not have a run-off election
    and endorsed and supported Chris McDaniel.

  content: "Yeah, that's right, Greg.\r\n\r\nErickson knows this is controversial.
    He should have told Priebus, \"Look, you're going to have an opportunity to answer
    direct questions from the grassroots about the Mississippi thing.\"\r\n\r\nPriebus
    would have balked, of course. \"Erick, I can't. They'll be all frothed-up with
    highly caffeinated tea. They won't listen to reason.\"\r\n\r\nErickson: \"Sorry.
    I know it will be difficult, but the people who pay to get into this thing are
    the grassiest of the grass roots. Or the rootiest. Whatever. You can't hide from
    this.\"\r\n\r\nPriebus: \"Then I'm not coming.\"\r\n\r\nErickson (to the audience):
    \"Sorry, folks, but Reince Priebus chose not attend. He would have been here if
    I'd promised him no questions about the Mississippi thing, but I wouldn't do that.
    I would have loved for him to be here and to talk about anything he wanted. But
    I wasn't about to deny you--the people paying for this event--the right to question
    him about Mississippi and the call for an investigation into race-baiting ads
    that attacked Tea Partiers.\"\r\n\r\nThat's how it should have gone down. That,
    of course, is not what happened."

    that seemed to cut out the Tea Party with a kind of forked tongue and actions
    in Wisconsin, and his insincerity when he speaks up to the public...kind of like
    acting.\r\n and Erickson who blocked me from the Red State blog because I questioned
    religion as opposed to Christianity as it originally was in its beginnings, He
    disagreed, I stood my ground as he called me  a \"people like you\" and blocked
    me. Besides, he never smiles on TV!\r\nDo we have the access to the use of an
    independent investigation into this disgusting racist crap?"

  content: I saw through Reince Priebus a long time ago.  He talks like he respects
    the Tea Party, but his actions show otherwise.  I will not give money to the RNC
    as long as he is Chairman.  Instead I give directly to the candidates I support
    so I know the money is being spent wisely.

    But we can ask other questions. \r\n\r\nFor example, Senator Roy Blunt supported
    the Mississippi race-baiting ads with a $15,000 donation. But Roy Blunt also signed
    our Tea Party Contract in <del datetime=\"2014-08-10T17:35:50+00:00\">September
    </del> October 2010. Proudly. <a href=\"http://moveonup.ning.com/profiles/blogs/roy-blunt-signs-tea-party\"
    target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">By signing, Roy Blunt stated he supports everything
    the Tea Party stands for</a>. \r\n\r\nMy question to Senator Blunt is: are you
    calling yourself a racist?"

    must be rehabilitated.  If the GOP is to attract more voters ( younger, hispanic,
    black, asian as well as others).  Then, thw establishment must be willing to walk
    from its cronies when they have lost.

    Convention.   Talk about pulling the rug out from under some body!   Just another
    political hack with a little more cred than most Democrats.   I consider myself
    an Occupy Tea Party person.   On one hand I think minimum wage should be zero
    and on the other hand why isn't Jon Corzine in jail.   It is the incestuous relationship
    between BIG BUSINESS and BIG GOVERNMENT that will be all of our undoing!

  content: Well, here's the clincher.  If you follower Erickson's blogs on redstate,  He's
    been pushing for a long time for Ted Cruz to weigh in on the primary battles and
    especially what happened in Mississippi and all that payed off because Ted Cruz
    eventually weighed in.  The argument could be made that well, Ted Cruz really
    can't change anything either.  What power does he have besides his "voice" and
    influence.  So why would we expect anything less from Rinse Pubus?

  content: Um, do you mean the guy born in 1896, or some other John Dos Passos?  If
    we are talking about the same person, during the 1960s he supported Goldwater
    (which is good), but also supported Nixon (bad) and in some degree McCarthy (bad).  One
    of his friends called him basically libertarian aka classical liberal (pretty
    good) in his views... but before WWII, the same John Dos Passos was a heavy supporter
    of Trotsky and the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, all the way up to the communist's
    role in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s.  He only decided communism as practiced
    by Stalin was a bad thing, when one of his friends was killed by the secret police
    in Spain.  Most of his writings are pro-socialism-slash-communism (albeit of the
    Marxist-Trotsky flavor it seems rather than Marxist-Stalinist).  What particular
    works by John Dos Passos are you recommending as valuable?  Or alternatively,
    is Wikipedia's coverage of the guy just totally wrongheaded?

  content: "Bill, perhaps you misunderstand who is paying for the redstate-fundraisers.
    \ The reason people buy tickets, is not merely because they are the rootiest &amp;
    grassiest of the grassroots, but also primarily to get access to big names like
    Priebus (and Cruz and so on).  Erickson knows this, and also knows that he cannot
    afford to lose *his* access to those big names (Priebus writes a \"drive-by\"
    diary entry for redstate from time to time). \r\n\r\nThis is nothing new:  \"You
    tell me whar a man gits his corn pone, en I'll tell you what his 'pinions is.
    \ ...man is not independent, and cannot afford views which might interfere with
    his bread and butter. If he would prosper, he must train with the majority; in
    matters of large moment, like politics and religion, he must think and feel with
    the bulk of his neighbors, or suffer damage in his social standing and in his
    business prosperities. He must restrict himself to corn-pone opinions -- at least
    on the surface. He must get his opinions from other people; he must reason out
    none for himself; he must have no first-hand views....\"  Mark Twain, on the politics
    of the late 1800s, full text at http://www.paulgraham.com/cornpone.html (worth
    reading) \r\n\r\nRedstate is a particular sort of digital neighborhood, wherein
    all 'neighbors' must agree; this groupthink is actively cultivated, by banning
    commenters who disagree with the target ideology (whether because they are too
    liberal or because they are 'too conservative' although it is of course not CALLED
    that).  From such a viewpoint, the flap over protecting Priebus from being forced
    to acknowledge the truth, really *is* just a \"minor bit of controversy\" as Erickson
    said in his blog.  \r\n\r\nErickson's position is that Priebus had no direct hand
    in the travesty, and therefore he has zero responsibility to put forth any leadership
    on the broader issue.  \"1. ...neither Reince nor the RNC had anything to do with
    [Mississippi]... had he [Priebus], like me [Erickson], denied responsibility...
    they&rsquo;d [questioners] have just been more angry.\"  Erickson is right about
    one thing:  Priebus saying he was not at fault, and that there was nothing he
    could do about Henry Barbour and race-baiting tactics, WOULD make people angry.
    \ Silent tacit support of Henry and his race-baiting also makes people very angry,
    of course.... \r\n\r\nErickson also know the key to his own corn pone.  \"2. ...organized
    effort to embarrass the Chairman... I undercut the effort ... No one [at redstate
    gatherings] gets the right to be a jerk ... The Chairman of the RNC is a good
    man and good chairman and much of what people are throwing at him is outside his
    control or portfolio.\"  The comments underneath, especially by redstate mods,
    are also quite revealing of the conflicted mindset held by redstate authors/owners.
    \ They know that access to big names, is what brings in the bucks for redstate;
    if the big names start to cancel, ticket sales to fundraising-gatherings will
    drop, and more big names will leave, and so on in a downward spiral.  \r\n\r\nRemember
    in the 2012 campaign, when Romney lived in such a protected bubble, that he confidently
    believed he would beat Obama in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and other completely-out-of-reach
    states?  That's not just bad polling; that's willful delusion.  Putting leadership
    into a bubble is not only immoral, it is also pragmatically counterproductive!
    \ \r\n\r\nWorst of all, Erickson knows quite well that the RNC is very tightly
    interconnected (more on this in a separate comment) with the folks directly responsible
    for the race-baiting attacks in Mississippi, so even though Priebus personally
    and the RNC as an official entity DON'T have their fingerprints DIRECTLY on the
    race-baiting itself, methinks there is definitely a responsibility for the RNC
    chair to speak up about such tactics.  Priebus knows all this, of course; Ed Martin
    made sure of it, despite the risk to himself personally (the RNC has already inquired
    in Missouri about unseating Martin).  Erickson knows all of this as well, but
    feels his own corn pone is too tightly intertwined with Priebus, Perry, and other
    big names that are indebted within the orbit of the Barbours.  \r\n\r\nAt the
    end of the day, it is sad that Erickson and redstate are only willing to support
    McDaniel so far, and no further.  But it is good of Erickson and redstate that
    they DID support McDaniel, as far as they were willing to.  I wish they had more
    gumption; but one has to pick battles carefully, and for Erickson, picking a fight
    with Priebus was a bridge too far.  The question of whether to censure Barbour,
    is not one that Erickson was willing to fight for, this time around.  \r\n\r\nBy
    way of analogy, the question of whether to impeach Obama is a tricky one; historically,
    attempting to impeach in partisan fashion will *boost* the approval-rating of
    the target (this happened with Bill Clinton in late 1998).  Palin and Allen West
    and Steve Stockman are pushing for impeachment proceedings, but plenty of sitting
    repubs are not, either because they think it will be counterproductive, or because
    they think it will have a low chance of success.  Erickson definitely has corn
    pone to protect, but I also think that the motion to censure Barbour, and/or to
    get Priebus to say anything on the record, has a low chance of success.  Does
    this \"minor controversy\" henceforth make Erickson a sunshine patriot, a member
    of the teastablishment like Ann Coulter, who talks a good game (usually) but when
    push comes to shove always backs Christie?  Prolly not, but it is pretty worrisome.
    \r\n\r\nPersonally, having no corn pone on the line, I think the rest of us should
    continue pushing for Barbour to lose his RNC seat (folks in Mississippi need to
    get involved at the county level so they can be delegates to the upcoming MSGOP
    convention where both Henry Barbour and state chair Nosef are up for re-election).
    \ I also think we should keep pushing to get individual RNC members to go on record
    with their stance, and similarly, keep pushing to get sitting repubs (and those
    up for election) on record with their stance.  Were the slimy tactics in Mississippi
    valid?  Is voter-ID and other election integrity work inherently racist?  Is the
    tea party inherently racist?  Tea party folks want to know."

    but prolly it is still in libraries with back-issues; I will post the list here,
    in case other people are also interested.  \r\n\r\nThe one from July'64 is about
    the repub natl convention where Goldwater was nominated, and the one from Oct'64
    is just before Goldwater was beaten by LBJ (partly due to the recency of JFK's
    assassination and partly due to getting little funding from estab-repubs in the
    Nixon-faction and no funding from moderate-repubs in the Rockefeller-faction).
    \ John Dos Passos also backed Taft'52.  \r\n\r\nDid find some pieces online talking
    about John Dos Passos himself; the guy is a bit of a conundrum.  Some say he was
    an individualist-anarcho-syndicalist, others say he was a basically-libertarian-traditionalist
    (what nowadays we might call a paleolibertarian), and one person labelled him
    a selfless-humanist-capitalist (whatever that is).  He first hated big biz, then
    he hated commies (though first he found it good), then hated the New Deal (though
    first he found it good also), and in the end also hated big unions, as well as
    big science.  Big bureaucracy was his enemy, in other words, aka the Establishment
    in all stripes; Jeffersonian-ish individual freedom was his theme.  \r\n\r\nIf
    he were alive nowadays, he would prolly be in the tea party faction of the repub
    party, but would also fit in well with the Libertarian Party, *and* simultaneously
    with the (original anti-bailout) Occupy Wall Street  folks.  An interesting fellow.
    \ His main book (he was a novelist) from his latter \"conservative phase\" was
    the 1961 novel Mid-Century; it is not really a political-position-piece, but it
    is supposed to highlight his idea of freedom, plus calls out many of his enemies
    in the Big Bureaucracy.  \r\n\r\nNow, basically 100% of his *pre*-WWII writing
    was perceived as pro-socialist pro-democrat and a bit pro-communist ... and some
    of it was, because at the time he saw Big Biz as the chief threat to freedom,
    believing technocrat Thorsten Veblen and socialist Eugene Debs were the answer
    (see also TR and his trust-busting; Dos Passos was a muckraker novelist basically).
    \ Unlike most of the muckrackers, though, Dos Passos saw the results of the Communist
    Revolution (Stalin and the KGB) and hated them, and saw the results of FDR's New
    Deal (bureaucracy and the Truman machine) and *really* disliked them.  John Dos
    Passos still though Big Biz was bad news, but not because he was anti-capitalist
    per se, but merely because he was anti-BIG.  \r\n\r\nJust as our host Mr Hennessy
    said.  ;-)"

<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Welcome, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/08/08/we-deserve-better/">Donald Trump</a> fans! Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>Yes, it's true, I have had disagreements with Erick in the past. I try to assess the situation, not just the person. It's possible to disagree with someone on one subject and to agree with them on another.</p>
<p>If anything, Erick showed consistency by rescinding Trump's invitation to Red State. Erick didn't want the event to descend into chaos led by my friends over the Barbour episode; he doesn't want a descent into chaos led by Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Some will call me a hypocrite. Go ahead. I've been called worse. And being seen as inconsistent on this matter is better, in my view, than siding with boorishness in an attempt to appear narrowly consistent some marginally important prior position. If I must be narrowly and reflexively consistent, I will remain consistent with my belief that the United States deserves and requires leaders of remarkable character, temperament, intelligence, creativity, and charm. I want it all in my next president. And <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/08/08/we-deserve-better/">Trump lacks several key ingredients</a>.</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/08/08/what-good-issued-from-the-candidate-debate/">continue reading</a>. Thanks</p>
<hr />
<p>Call it the hand of God.</p>
<p>I was supposed to go to RedState Gathering this weekend, but things didn't work out at the list minute. Now, I'm glad I wasn't there.</p>
<p>Red State Gathering is blogger Erick Erickon's annual conservative gabfest. This year, it was in Ft. Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_15224" align="alignright" width="320"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo-2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-15224 size-full" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo-2.jpg" alt="Reince Preibus at RedState 2014" width="320" height="240" /></a> Reince Priebus and Erick Erickson at RedState. Photo by anonymous Tea Partier[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Reince Priebus</strong>, RNC Chairman, was one of the speakers. Priebus is under heavy pressure from <a title="Chairman Ed Martin Demands Mississippi Investigation" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/09/chairman-ed-martin-demands-mississippi-investigation/">Missouri's Ed Martin</a> and others to investigate Henry Barbour's role in political attack ads that accuse the Tea Party of racism. So far, Priebus has blocked any such investigation.</p>
<p>Reince Priebus&nbsp;is running&nbsp;cover for&nbsp;Thad Cochran and Henry Barbour who called you, dear read, racist.</p>
<p>Traditionally, speakers at events like RedState Gathering take questions from the audience. But Erickson saw that Tea Party Patriots were armed with signs and tough questions for the Priebus&nbsp;.</p>
<p><strong>I asked Erickson, via Twitter, why he protected Priebus from questions</strong>. Here's Erick's response.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whennessy">@whennessy</a> because <a href="https://twitter.com/Reince">@Reince</a> had nothing to do with it and gets blamed for much not his fault.</p>
<p>&mdash; Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) <a href="https://twitter.com/EWErickson/statuses/498216275290509312">August 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Erickson's answer is nonsense. No, Priebus did not authorize Henry Barbour's attack on the Tea Party. He is not responsible for Barbour's actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But <strong>Priebus is solely responsible for his own response to irrefutable evidence that Henry Barbour funded the ads</strong>. Erickson has made himself culpable in the cover-up by protecting Priebus who is protecting Barbour. (Priebus and Barbour go way back, as we shall see later.) It's typical Republican Establishment "cover your ass" nonsense.</p>
<p>Erickson has not responded to my follow-up question:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
.@EWErickson1 <a href="https://twitter.com/Reince">@Reince</a> could answer for himself, couldn't he? Why no investigation of Henry Barbour's attack on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teaparty?src=hash">#teaparty</a>?</p>

<p>Priebus is Chairman of the RNC, for God's sake. He's in charge. He needs a blogger to protect him from Tea Party Patriots? Give me a break.</p>

<h3>Enter Ed Martin, Stage Right</h3>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a title="Ed Martin Moves to Censure Henry Barbour Over Racist Mississippi Ads" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/06/ed-martin-moves-censure-henry-barbour-racist-mississippi-ads/">Missouri GOP Chairman, Ed Martin, has risked his entire political future</a> by filing motions of censure against Henry Barbour and the Mississippi Republicans who shamefully libeled tea partiers, plagiarizing&nbsp;the vilest tactics&nbsp;from the Al Sharpton playbook.</p>
<p>I realize it's considered bad form to set up a guest for humiliation in some circles. I get that. But if you're going to allow Priebus to speak, you have to let him feel the heat for his&nbsp;failure to investigate the shenanigans in Mississippi. By blocking the investigation, Priebus is protecting the bad actors and further alienating grassroots conservatives.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know why Priebus won't investigate Mississippi. <a href="http://spectator.org/articles/59914/rnc-chair-priebus-under-fire" target="_blank">As the Spectator pointed out, Henry Barbour and Reince Priebus are old buddies</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">Martin&rsquo;s request for an investigation would be, one thinks, a no-brainer. This is, after all, the party of Lincoln. Race baiting has no place in the Republican Party, which came to be in the first place because of its staunch opposition to slavery.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">But there&rsquo;s a problem:&nbsp;Take a look at&nbsp;</span><a style="color: inherit;" href="http://capitolresourcesllc.com/profiles/h_barbour.htm">this link</a><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;to a site for a lobbying group called Capital Resources, which includes a bio for one of the group&rsquo;s partners, the aforementioned Henry Barbour. If you scan down a bit there is a series of bullet points describing Barbour&rsquo;s background. The very first one reads as follows: &ldquo;Helped run RNC Chairman Reince Priebus&rsquo; campaign for chairman.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Here's the most depressing part of this whole sordid story. When faced with the choice of offending the Tea Party or the Establishment, Erickson decided to protect the Establishment.</p>
<p>Maybe Erickson was just being a good and gracious host. That's what I want to think. But to those of us who've been in the streets fighting the establishment, this feels like another sell-out.</p>
