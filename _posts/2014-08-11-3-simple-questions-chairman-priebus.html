  content: "&ldquo;The Chairman of the RNC is a good man and good chairman and much
    of what people are throwing at him is outside his control or portfolio.&rdquo;
    What do you mean? Priebus is Chairman of the RNC and he should have been the one
    to call for an investigation into the sordid Mississippi Senate race and hold
    those responsible for the despicable racist acts. Ed Martin is trying to hold
    accountable those responsible for the despicable acts, something Priebus SHOULD
    be doing. I stand with Ed Martin. What is the point of having your convention
    if it is scripted and the attendees are not able to get their questions answered?
    Why do you not want to get to the bottom of the sordid Mississippi Senate race?
    \ If Thad Cochran had any principles he would have retired after losing in the
    primary, after 40+ years in Congress and not have a run-off election and endorsed
    and supported Chris McDaniel."

  content: For establishment Republicans (that includes Priebus) truth and principle
    do not factor into their decision making.  Power and money are all they consider.  What
    happened in the MS primary Senate run off is a disgrace to our party.  Everyone
    who stands behind the election results are cowards.

<p>On Saturday, I raised a <a title="Why Is Erick Erickson Protecting Reince Priebus?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/09/erick-erickson-reince-priebus/">concern about Erick Erickson's handling of Reince Priebus</a> at Erickson's annual RedState Gathering.</p>
<p>Today, Erick responded to widespread criticism of his decision to protect the GOP Chairman from questions about tactics in the Mississippi Republican Senate Runoff. Here's the heart of Erickson's answer:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">But there was more to it than me knowing people would be angry about Mississippi. First, many of the people told me what they wanted to ask Reince. Unfortunately, neither Reince nor the RNC had anything to do with the points they wanted to make. They no more believed me on that than they&rsquo;d believe the Chairman. Had he, like me, denied responsibility to their points, they&rsquo;d have just been more angry.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>If Erickson was serious about putting this issue to bed, he might have identified those points about which the RNC knows nothing. (Although, that could be a very long list.) Instead,&nbsp;Erickson is basically saying, "look, I'd have opened up the mic, but you people wanted to ask&nbsp;stupid questions."</p>
<p>Let's put these three questions to Chairman Priebus:</p>
<ol>
<li>What <a href="https://dbgzvifxo1i3b.cloudfront.net/tppcf/32/MS-Case-Study.pdf" target="_blank">evidence have you gathered&nbsp;about RNC</a> committeeman Henry Barbour's involvement in race-bating ads placed before the Mississippi Runoff?</li>
<li>
<p>How has that evidence affected your&nbsp;handling of&nbsp;RNC committeeman <a title="Chairman Ed Martin Demands Mississippi Investigation" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/09/chairman-ed-martin-demands-mississippi-investigation/" target="_blank">Ed Martin's request for investigation</a> and <a title="Ed Martin Moves to Censure Henry Barbour Over Racist Mississippi Ads" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/06/ed-martin-moves-censure-henry-barbour-racist-mississippi-ads/">censure of Republicans </a>responsible for those ads?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.&nbsp;How have you communicated your findings to Ed Martin?</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="http://capitolresourcesllc.com/profiles/h_barbour.htm" target="_blank">Henry Barbour ran Priebus's campaign for GOP chairman</a>. And there is an irrefutable money trail from Henry Barbour's group, Mississippi Conservatives, to the PAC that ran the race-baiting ads. From <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/383087/barbour-machines-mississippi-ad-war-eliana-johnson" target="_blank">National Review Online</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">As it turns out,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #000000;">Crudup</span><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;raised all of the $144,685 his PAC took in from exactly one source: Haley Barbour&rsquo;s political machine. A report filed with the Federal Election Commission reveals that Mississippi Conservatives, the political-action committee founded by the former Mississippi governor and Republican National Committee chairman and run by his nephew, Henry, provided that money to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #000000;">Crudup&rsquo;s</span><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;group in four installments. The first, in the amount of $62,685, came on June 10, a week after the race was thrown into a runoff. Cochran and his allies were looking to increase voter turnout across the state, particularly among African Americans and Democrats who had not voted in the June 3 primary.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I won't insult Erickson's intelligence by pretending Erick believes what he wrote today. <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2014/08/11/questioning-the-chairman/" target="_blank">I'm appalled that Erickson would insult ours by writing it</a>.</p>
