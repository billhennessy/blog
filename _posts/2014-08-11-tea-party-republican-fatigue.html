  content: "Bill, this is the nail, being hit on the head.  \"Or maybe things are
    right where the Establishment want them&mdash;the Tea Partiers returning silently
    to their pre-2009 lives or moving over to the Libertarian Party.\"  \r\n\r\nIf
    we want to retake the repub party, and make is once again the party of Reagan'76
    ... and in many ways Goldwater'64 and Taft'40 ... plus parts of Coolidge'24 and
    Cleveland'80 and Tyler'40 ... of course huge chunks of Madison'08 + Jefferson'00
    + Adams'96 + Washington'88 ... not to mention more than a little bit of Paine'76
    + Franklin'58 ... those darn old the ancient republics too while I'm at it ...
    then starting Yet Another New Party is the wrong tactical approach, whether you
    call it the Davids or the Plebes or the Conservative Party or whatever.  (Constitution
    Party is taken.  Libertarian Party is taken.  American Party is taken.  Reform
    Party is taken.  You get the gist.  Anti Bull Moose Party is *not* taken, but
    people will think you mean anti-ballistic-missile party.)  \r\n\r\nTactics are
    not the whole story though.  The fundamental reason, for why the tea-party-folks
    have only one option, which is to retake the repub party from the inside, is Duverger's
    law.  You have studied Condorcet, and seen the danger of vote-splitting; in any
    system where the voting-system is first past the post, then INEXORABLY what develops
    is a twin-party-system (aka the estab).  The only option available, mathematically,
    is to pick one of the twins, and make it our own.  As the old joke goes, people
    talk about a third party, but I'd be happy with an actual *second* party.  \r\n\r\nSometimes
    math is wrong, but history also proves the exact same point.  Ron Paul, a rep
    (never senator / never governor) at the old age 76, got 2m votes when he ran as
    a repub during the primaries.  Gary Johnson, a former gov w/ executive experience
    at the ideal age of 59, later in 2012 only managed 1m votes, despite a largely
    identical platform, despite a more centrist stance on marijuana, despite a MUCH
    larger electorate pool to draw from, and despite a repub candidate so unpopular
    that Romney'12 did proportionally worse than McCain'08.  Similarly, when Ron Paul
    himself ran as an L, he lost extremely badly.  When even earlier, David Koch ran
    as an L, he did very poorly.  This is not because of a lack of money; this is
    not because of a lack of ideas; this is not because of name-recognition.  It is
    because of the election-math which dooms all such efforts to fruitlessness:  Duverger's
    law.  \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law \r\n\r\nThe folks
    who are estab-repubs (and for that matter estab-dems) understand Duverger's law
    very clearly.  They know that they can win the presidential primaries, simply
    by fielding one main estab-repub, who goes up against a good-sized-handful of
    challengers that split the votes betwixt themselves, handing the estab-repub a
    plurality victory.  Even better if the estab-repub has tons more cash from mega-donors,
    and an obsequious RNC that will helpfully 'compress' the primaries to favor those
    mega-donor favorites, at the behest of Henry Barbour's autopsy report, and his
    hand-picked chair Priebus.  \r\n\r\nOrchestrating the vote-splitting is hard sometimes,
    even when you have the mega-donors and the media and any number of estab-repubs
    willing to masquerade as stalking-horse-candidates for you.  Therefore, the estab-repubs
    are ecstatic when conservatives get fed up and sit out the primaries, or when
    libertarian-leaning repubs (or right-leaning libertarians as the case may be)
    get fed up and become capital-letter Libertarians for a time, or forever.  Estab-repubs
    are *happy* when people don't vote; it makes their lives much easier.  Estab-repubs
    are *happy* when people divert their efforts, funds, and gumption into third parties,
    because Duverger's law guarantees those will fail (and the deck of media access
    / debates / ballot access / low info voters / mega-donors are of course also stacked
    entirely against such things).  \r\n\r\nThere is a reason the Ron Paul returned
    to the R brand, in order to run in 2008 and 2012.  There is a reason that the
    Koch Bros fund candidates with R behind their name, nowadays.  There is a reason
    that Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and Rand Paul and Tim Scott and Paul LePage have the
    R as their branding.  During the 2016 primaries, there will be at least one tea
    / liberTea / similar candidate.  My hope is that there will be a large handful
    of such folks, on the repub stage during the televised debates, who then -- all
    but one of them -- drop out immediately prior to the Iowa caucus, ideally all
    endorsing the last Constitutionalist standing.  It seems likely that Rand Paul
    will run in 2016, and will get considerably more than 2m votes during even a compressed-primary-season.
    \ Even if he fails to win in 2016, a brokered repub convention in Cleveland is
    a serious possibility, for the first time in this millenium.  There will not be
    any uppercase Libertarian folks there, but I want to see hundreds and hundreds
    of liberTea repubs in Ohio.  \r\n\r\nBut for that to happen, we need presidential
    delegates from the state conventions, which means we need state delegates from
    the county conventions, which means we need county delegates from the precinct
    conventions.  Those won't happen all by themselves; we will have to work hard
    between now and 2016.  If we spend the time between now and then working on new
    voting-systems, working on founding new political parties, working on revisions
    to the jury system, or otherwise doing important-but-non-urgent work, there is
    a good possibility that the estab will *really* crush the tea party in 2016.  Ed
    Martin ousted, for starters.  Ron Johnson and Pat Toomey beaten.  Just when the
    age-group factor was turning our way, too... Reagan hit the demographic sweet
    spot in 1980, when he was 69, very old but still going strong.  Rand will hit
    the demographic sweet spot in 2020, when he is 61, just about the sweet spot for
    a repub nominee.  He will also have a shot in 2016, at age 57.  Cruz will be in
    his 50s during the '24 '28 '32 elections.  As of the 2020 election, voting-age
    to retirement-age adults are those born between 1955 and 2002.  That is *not*
    an estab-repub demographic; that is a liberTea-repub demographic.  \r\n\r\nAnyways,
    as usual I have written you a small book.  In a nutshell, you can label yourself
    whatever you want, but please help retake the repub party.  It is the only way
    we can do this thing, according to the math of the election-system.  That doesn't
    mean we cannot pressure the estab-candidates with undervoting, when they are egregiously
    awful.  But we must be surgical in our scorched-earth, and have marine-like discipline
    in our terminology.  Letting the estab-repubs disgust us, so that we give up,
    plays right into their hands.  Instead we should stand pat, call for reinforcements,
    and then move forward despite their sneering laughter; it will turn to powerless
    gasping rage, if we sing and smile as we lock arms and advance.  Like a good low-pressure
    salesman, per your good advice, I will not keep badgering you about this topic.
    \ As you said in one of your pieces, from time to time, tuning out is a perfectly
    normal and healthy thing to do.  But please think over the points I brought up
    here; if they work for you, great, if they don't, you will still be a-okay in
    my book.  (You'd be even more a-okay with a pet goat, but that is another comment
    for another time!)"

<p>Maybe the chickens are coming home to roost for the GOP in St. Louis County.<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/chickens_at_roost_sm.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-15214 size-full" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/chickens_at_roost_sm.jpg" alt="chickens at roost" width="400" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>In my day job, I focus on two subjects: strategic behavioral science and analytics. Really smart people do most of the heavy analytics work. I deal with the human behavior (neuroeconomics, psychology, etc.). In our narrow field of loyalty and motivation, I think we're the best in the business. Not me, but the people I work with. For example, one client asked us to develop a strategy for overhauling their loyalty program. The result was nearly a 20 percent increase in sales YOY against market growth of 8 percent.</p>
<p>Before I moved into strategy, I was a software architect. The two fields, strategy and coding, are more alike than you might imagine.</p>
<p>Both fields help you develop a sense for patterns and anomalies. There might be a name for this sense, but I don't know what it is.&nbsp;But I know it when I feel it.</p>
<p>After Tuesday's primary, I felt it, so I've been crunching numbers.</p>
<h3>St. Louis County Primary Numbers Were Weird</h3>
<p>As I said, I'm not the hard numbers guy, but I have taken a few stats classes. And I use some statistical analysis every day. When I think a number looks&nbsp;goofy, I do is a quick analysis (ANOVA, chi square, whatever it takes) to see if the differences are really freaky or if it's just my imagination.</p>
<p>I wrote about weird numbers <a title="What the Hell Is Up In Missouri&rsquo;s 2nd Congressional District?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/05/hell-missouris-2nd-congressional-district/">Tuesday night</a> and again on <a title="7 Fascinating Results In The Missouri Primary" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/06/10-curious-results-missouri-primary/">Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>Last night, I took another look&nbsp;at voting in St. Louis County from 2006 to 2014. I looked only at primaries. Here's what I found: they're really freaky. Especially if you're a County Republican.</p>
<p><strong>Democrat ballots increased steadily from 2006 to 2012</strong>. But Democrat ballots&nbsp;in&nbsp;2014 were insanely high. In fact, they were nearly two standard deviations over 2006 to 2014 period.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_15190" align="aligncenter" width="700"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Slide1.png"><img class="wp-image-15190 size-large" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Slide1-1024x576.png" alt="Democrat Primary Ballots STL CO" width="700" height="393" /></a> Source: St. Louis County Board of Elections[/caption]</p>
<p>That should concern the County Republicans, but not as much as Republican trends</p>
<p><strong>Republican ballots were more than one standard deviation high in 2010 and 2012</strong>. In 2014, they were not ridiculously low; they reverted to the mean.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_15191" align="aligncenter" width="700"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Slide2.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-15191" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Slide2-1024x576.png" alt="Republican Ballots STL CO" width="700" height="393" /></a> Source: St. Louis County Board of Elections[/caption]</p>
<p>If you notice, <strong>Republican ballots were more than one standard deviation high in both 2010 and 2012</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm going to speculate that Tea Party activism contributed some of that bump&nbsp;in 2010 and 2012. Face it, we haven't been nearly as visible in 2014 as we were in those years.</p>
<p>The GOP's real problem with the Tea Party (and will free market conservatives in general) goes deeper than fewer grassroots activist demonstrations. I'll get to that shortly.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=15208">Lee Presser's excellent guest post </a>on Hennessy's View asks similar, disturbing questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Republican voters are not adrift, why did so many Republican voters who voted for Steve Stenger continue to vote for other Democrats? Asked more directly, why were Republican voters so unsure their County Executive candidate was going to win in November that they had to vote for Stenger to make sure Dooley would be gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I'm not the only one asking these questions or noticing these trends in St. Louis County. So I kept digging.</p>
<h3>Nate Silver Sees Something In the Number, Too</h3>
<p>Even after&nbsp;I did the analysis, I was tempted&nbsp;to say, "nah, Hennessy; you're seeing things," and drop this until I could do more analysis. Then I read<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/republicans-have-more-reason-than-ever-to-worry-about-primary-challenges/" target="_blank"> this article on Nate Silvers' FiveThirtyEight</a>&nbsp;blog. He begins:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #222222;">One of the most universal lessons of sports prediction is that margins matter. An NFL team that wins a number of games by less than a touchdown might get banner headlines for its clutch performance. But a team&rsquo;s record in close games is mostly just luck. A football team that thrives on winning close games is&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #008fd5;" href="http://grantland.com/features/re-caging-the-panthers/">likely to see its luck revert to the mean</a><span style="color: #222222;">&nbsp;and start losing its fair share of them. The&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #008fd5;" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/library/principles/expected-wins-and-losses/" target="_blank">same is true in baseball</a><span style="color: #222222;">, basketball and most other sports.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Makes sense. And he's right. Teams that rely on one freakish outlier statistic usually crash hard to the mean--in the Super Bowl or NFC Championship or Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>Politics is no different from sports. Statistics tell you something. They report on how humans perform in given situations. What I love about my day job is the combination of the two: numbers and people. If I could, I'd go back to school to study neuroeconomics.</p>
<p>Nate Silver tells us <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/republicans-have-more-reason-than-ever-to-worry-about-primary-challenges/" target="_blank">what Senatorial close calls mean for GOP incumbents</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">Between 2004 and 2008, just four of 39 Republican senators running for renomination, or 10 percent of them, got less than 65 percent of the primary vote. This year, <strong>five of 10 have fallen below that threshold</strong>: not only Roberts, Cochran and McConnell, but also<span class="highlight-16235">Lindsey Graham</span>&nbsp;of South Carolina and&nbsp;<span class="highlight-16235">John Cornyn</span>&nbsp;of Texas, who both benefited from running against divided fields.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In fact, the average share of the primary vote received by Republican incumbent senators so far this year is 73 percent. Not only is that lower than 2004 through 2008, when incumbents averaged 89 percent of the vote &mdash; <strong>it&rsquo;s also lower than 2010 and 2012, the years when the tea party was supposedly in ascendancy</strong>, when GOP incumbents got an average of 78 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">Ascendancy and maturity are two different things.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A lot of Tea Partiers suffer from&nbsp;Republican Fatigue Syndrome.&nbsp;RFS is&nbsp;a disease spread through casual contact with the establishment. Republican Fatigue Sydrome explains both the Senate incumbent challenges and the St. Louis County primary numbers. I'll give you that the County Executive race lifted the Democrat ballots above their eight-year trend line. But that doesn't account for the sharp fall in GOP ballots this year.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">(Before I forget, here's the link to my<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?page=view&amp;resid=67DE16C5796AAD35!6626&amp;authkey=!AASiySqN3ldf0sI" target="_blank"> Excel spreadsheet</a>.)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">For example, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=15208">Lee Presser noticed that Ann Wagner get fewer votes</a> in St. Louis County in 2014 than in 2012 And the Democrats got more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">Compare the numbers above [2014] to the vote totals from the 2012 St. Louis County primary election. Then, four Republican primary candidates for Missouri&rsquo;s 2nd Congressional district received 63,978 votes. Of that total, <strong>Mrs. Wagner received 42,573 votes (2106 more votes than she received in 2014)</strong>. Four 2012 Democrat primary candidates received a total of 22,446. 2014 candidate <strong>Lieber received 48,742, which was 26,296 more votes than four 2012 Democrat candidates</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">Remember, Republican ballots in 2012 were a full standard deviation above the eight-year trend in St. Louis County.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">The Science of Persuasion Could Affect November Turnout</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Psychologically, Tuesday's turnout was really bad news for Republicans in St. Louis County. While voting is dynamic and events can alter trajectories, two&nbsp;psychological factors will help Democrats in November: consistency and social proof.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The easiest way to get people to take a big step, like voting in a general election, is to get them to take a small step, like putting a yard sign up or donating (even $1), or voting in a primary. As the charts above indicate, Democrat primary votes in St. Louis County have been steadily increasing for a decade. Tuesday was a step change. People who pulled a Democrat ballot on Tuesday are very likely to vote Democrat again in November. That's the consistency part.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Studies show that Democrats tend to hang around with other Democrats and Republicans hang around with Republicans. Plus, the number one predictor of whether someone actually votes is if someone in their network votes. And that effect extends to people two-degrees of separation from the voter, as<a title="Here&rsquo;s How I&rsquo;m Voting August 5 (with printable grid of ballot measures) *Update*" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/31/im-voting-august-5-primary-printable-grid-ballot-initiatives/"> I mentioned in my pre-election blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when we control for alternative sources of similar behavior, such as having the same income, education, ideology, or level of political interest, the typical subject is about 15 percent more likely to vote if one of his discussion partners votes. But does this influence spread beyond that to the rest of the network? As it turns out, we see a correlation between people who are directly connected and also between people who are indirectly connected via a common friend. In other words, <strong>if you vote, then it increases the likelihood that your friends&rsquo; friends vote as well.</strong></p>
<p><em>Christakis, Nicholas A.; Fowler, James H. (2009-09-09).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Connected-Surprising-Power-Social-Networks-ebook/dp/B002OFVO5Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406765428&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=connected" target="_blank">Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives</a>&nbsp;(p. 185). Hachette Book Group. Kindle Edition.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">Those 130,000 people who voted Democrat on Tuesday likely have 5 close friends. Each of those friends has 5 friends. Three from each circle is likely to vote, in part because of the person who voted in August. You do the math.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, the number of registered voters has declined over that period while the number of Democrat voters has risen.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">I haven't done all the math, but it appears that the loss of registrations in St. Louis County comes disproportionately from Republican voters. That aligns to my post-2012 analysis that concluded <a title="This Is The Infographic That The Whole Republican Party Is Freaking Out About" href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/12/06/this-is-the-infographic-that-the-whole-republican-party-is-freaking-out-about/">Republicans are dying faster than Democrats</a>, and the GOP isn't replacing those deceased voters. I also <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/11/07/the-conservative-base-is-dying-and-taking-freedom-with-it/">discussed the problem here</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">So the GOP has a lot of work to do before November. It needs to reignite traditional Republican voters, overcome a growing Democrat advantage in the County, and find a cure for Republican Fatigue Syndrome among free market conservatives.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Or maybe things are right where the Establishment want them&mdash;the Tea Partiers returning silently to their pre-2009 lives or moving over to the Libertarian Party. If you wonder, "why would Tea Partiers abandon Republicans," look no further than <a title="Why Is Erick Erickson Protecting Reince Priebus?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/09/erick-erickson-reince-priebus/">the race-baiting fiasco in Mississippi that has now embroiled Erick Erickson of RedState</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">If that's the way the Establishment wanted things, all I can say is "Mission accomplished."</p>
