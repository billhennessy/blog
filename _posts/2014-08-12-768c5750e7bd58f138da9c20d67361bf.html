<p>Mr. Hennessey:</p>
<p>I am contacting you on behalf of a group called Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty (www.conservativesconcerned.org).  I handle their PR.</p>
<p>I read your piece 'How Do You Justify the Death Penalty?' with great interest.  </p>
<p>I hope at some point you will take a look at Conservatives Concerned and consider letting your audience know about them. </p>
<p>You are not alone.</p>
<p>We were all at CPAC St. Louis last year and we found a lot of support among conservatives for re-thinking the death penalty.  We've also attended the last two national CPACs in Washington and have had a great reception.</p>
<p>I'd love the opportunity to tell you more about the group and what they are doing.</p>
<p>I thank you.</p>
