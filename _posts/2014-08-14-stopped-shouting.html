  content: "The keys are as follows:  \r\n\r\n1.  shouting, which in the olden days
    was called pamphlets.  The tea party has that down pat.  But so do the dems slash
    estab-repubs, and *they* control the teevee.  Shouting can only take us so far.
    \ \r\n\r\n2.  thoughtfulness, which in the olden days was called the Federalist
    Papers, Hayek, et cetera.  The tea party also has this down pat, although more
    could be done.  As before, though, the dems slash estab-repubs largely control
    the schools, from the NEA &amp;&amp; Common Core in K-12, all the way through
    PhD in Keynesian Econ, which means that philosophizing can only take us so far.
    \ \r\n\r\n3.  weaponry, which in the olden days was called the second amendment.
    \ The tea party, once again, has this one down pat.  But once again, the dems
    slash estab-repubs control the marines, the air force, the ICBMs, the NSA surveillance,
    and the paramilitary SWAT teams.  There are constitutionalist sheriffs here and
    there, and the constitutionalist Ron Paul got more donations from active military
    than anybody else in 2012, but the cards are stacked against this one.  \r\n\r\n4.
    \ organization, aka coalitions and delegates and caucuses and PACs and so on.
    \ This is an area where the tea party is weak, but growing stronger.  There are
    many PACs now which do good work.  There are tea-party-caucus groups (and liberty-caucus
    groups) at the national level.  There are local tea-party-groups in many states
    and counties of the country.  But there is still much more to do.  Many PACs and
    caucuses are compromised, either by groups pushing non-tea-agendas, or by estab-folks
    trying to co-opt the infrastructure, or both.  Reactionary-tea-party-members screaming
    on the internet will not help fix this; we need to have a clear-eyed look at which
    groups and which leading members support which aspects of the tea party, and by
    what percentage, and in what priority.  Screaming is no help with such work; more
    infrastructure is needed, to separate the truth from the lies.  Similarly, the
    tea party is weak in helping do the mundane and boring work of running a political
    party; not enough tea party folks are on their county executive committee, on
    their county election commission, on their state-level party delegation, and so
    on.  There are not enough tea party supporters who are members of the RNC, state
    party chairs, national convention delegates, and in other positions of power.
    \ Hence, whenever there is an RNC motion to censure Henry Barbour, it fails, and
    when McDaniel puts evidence before the SREC they refuse to consider it, plus around
    25% of the time when McDaniel volunteers seek courthouse-records, they are denied.
    \ We have the numbers, but we do not have the organizational strength.  Duverger's
    law prevents any hope of making a 'third' party succeed; we must refactor the
    repub party from within, if we want to have a REAL second party.  That takes work,
    and we are not yet doing enough in that respect.  Estab-repubs re-asserted control
    over the Iowa party and the Nevada party and the Alaska party, during 2013 maneuvering
    -- this is part of the reason why Ed Martin had no luck getting Barbour censured
    in August 2014.  \r\n\r\n5.  story-telling, which in the olden days was called
    history and oratory.  How did the founders convince the broad mass of people in
    the colonies to support the war of independence?  It wasn't with shouting, with
    thoughtfulness, or with weaponry.  It was with stories:  the Boston Massacre,
    the Boston Tea Party, the Ride of Paul Revere, the flag of Betsy Ross, and Washington
    Crossing The Delaware River on Christmas Eve to defeat the Royal Army via sneak
    attack at knight with bayonets (forcing them to flee back to OWS territory).  Older
    stories were also key:  there was good reason that the founders drew parallels
    to the republic of the Athenian Greeks, with wise Athena and her shield as their
    heroine.  There was good reason for drawing the parallels to the republic of the
    Romans.  There was good reason to linking our success to Adam Smith, with his
    story of the pin-making-factory.  There was good reason for linking our success
    to John Locke, with his discussion of individual rights.  There was good reason
    for linking our success to liberty, and stories thereof.  What can the dems and
    estab-repubs offer, in terms of stories?  The story of the 1871 welfare state
    of the Kaiser.  The story of the 1917 welfare state of Lenin.  The story of the
    1949 welfare state of Mao.  The story of the modern welfare state of Greece.  Those
    are not very convincing stories, even when filtered through the estab-schools
    and the estab-media!  The internet makes rewriting history harder than it used
    to be.  \r\n\r\n6.  real-world success, which in the olden days was called reality.
    \ On the dem-side, their most recent \"success\" story is Obama, but his success
    is a lie (starting with broken 2008 campaign promises and continuing right through
    the current scandals... each with their associated coverup).  On the estab-repub-side,
    their most recent \"success\" story is GWB+GHWB (and soon Jeb aka Bush The Third).
    \ The tea party repubs have a modern success story, in Ronald Reagan, although
    estab-repubs often try to claim him also; tea also has a fairly recent failure-story,
    in Barry Goldwater... not to mention Bob Taft of the 1940s.  The conserva-dems
    &amp;&amp; centrist-repubs have a modern success story, the latter six years of
    Bill Clinton &amp;&amp; Newt Gingrich.  They hope to paint Hillary as part of
    that, rather than as part of Hillarycare which screwed up the first two years
    of Bill Clinton (and as part of Obama and Benghazi and Obamacare of course), but
    this ploy is unlikely to succeed.  Personally, I expect that just like in 2008,
    the dems will nominate somebody hitherto relatively unknown, most likely Gillibrand
    D-NY, who has the advantage of being a drop-in replacement for Hillary (female
    &amp;&amp; wall-street-friendly) but without the baggage &amp;&amp; wrinkles.
    \ Dems and estab-repubs can use their influence in the media and the schools to
    try and rewrite history, and also to rewrite reality, but facts are stubborn things,
    as Reagan was fond of saying.  We can show real-world success, by getting elected
    (tea-party state legislatures are beginning to form in NH and in TX for instance),
    and by getting real-world projects up and running (Rand Paul is trying to convince
    people to help form tax-free regulation-free zoning areas for instance).  Given
    the nasty tactics used in the 2014 contests, and for that matter, in the 2012
    elections, it is definitely going to be hard for the tea party to have a strong
    showing in 2016.  But we will do better in 2016 than we did in 2014, and with
    luck, better than we did in 2012; our eyes are open now. \r\n\r\nSpecifically,
    as far as story-telling is concerned, one thing that I would recommend is for
    tea party folks in Mississippi to organize gratis public showings, in all 82 counties,
    of the old Frank Capra film from the black-n-white days, Mister Smith Goes To
    Washington.  This is a tale of a Constitution-loving boy scout leader, son of
    a populist pamphlet publisher, who is sent to DC as a senator by mistake, when
    the ancient holder of one Senate seat died in office.  The corrupt governor (in
    Jackson City) made the appointment, thinking that this rube would be an easy-to-control
    moron, and would therefore unwittingly help the corrupt Senator still in DC(called
    the silver knight based on his hairstyle... and his principles before the estab
    co-opted him twenty years back) plus the corrupt establishment thugs continue
    their pork-slash-graft operations.  Turns out, that the \"rube\" was not such
    a fool after all, and uncovered the corruption, vowing to overturn it; the machine
    tried to assassinate his character to stop him, but with help from a plucky secretary,
    his mom back home, and a bit of luck, the good side won in the end. \r\n\r\nI
    have hope that the good side will win in the end, too, here in our full-color
    modern reality.  But if we want to do that, we need to get the broad mass of Mississippians
    on our side; more shouting will not help much, additional thoughtful philosophizing
    will not help much, either.  Weaponry and organization are both of zero help here.
    \ Telling the story, of how McDaniel stood up against the corrupt machine in real
    life, may just help.  Double-especially if we have a Capra tale, to make the message
    go down easier, and more memorably.  (Also won't hurt to use the Atlas Shrugged
    movie trilogy, when that comes out in September, during the general election battle
    against Childers.)  Story-telling has not been the strong suit of the tea-party,
    to date, but it very well may just be our ace in the hole."

  content: "Excellent piece, Bill and greatly appreciated. As I get older I find more
    of the crotchety \"when I was a boy\" crap coming out of my mouth whenever I get
    involved in an impassioned political debate or fwd an email. In other words, I
    found myself shouting. Even though I instinctively knew the wisdom and effectiveness
    of reasoned, factual, \"tale-based\" discourse, I would lose patience dealing
    with some idealistic, fantasy-believing product of modern \"higher education\"
    and bluntly begin verbally beating them about the head &amp; shoulders! I had
    forgotten the wisdom of the old saying, \"Arguing with an idiot is like wrestling
    with a pig in the mud. You both get dirty and you soon realize the pig's enjoying
    himself!\" \r\n\r\nYour post (and especially the very lucid commenter above, kudos
    to him!) remind me to keep my focus and my calm and also to remember the first
    rule of Debate &amp; Rhetoric: \"He who asks the most questions controls the Debate.\"
    Instead of lecturing or ranting, ask questions that force your opponent to examine
    why they believe what they believe and if possible force them to defend it. They
    usually can't and you have the satisfaction of knowing you can answer effectively
    if they try the same tactic on you or, as often happens, you realize you have
    \"won\" the debate when they become so flustered that they resort to ad hominim
    attacks. But every once in a while, you also get the satisfaction of realizing
    that maybe you just opened their eyes and made them think.\r\n\r\nThanks again
    for the reminder and the advice."

    battle against Childers.\" is the Cochran/Blunt Republican establishment's battle
    to fight and NOT ours to fight; especially after this group just pulled out all
    stops to \"crush\" McDaniel.  \r\n\r\nThis is how we need to approach EVERY general
    election involving Republican establishment candidates - sit them out or vote
    3rd party.  Another radical thought: To really \"crush\" the Republican establishment
    \"crushers\" we need to consider holding our noses and voting for Democrats in
    close general election races against establishment Republican incumbents, who
    for all intents and purposes will continue to vote like Democrats to expand the
    size and power of government.  At this point the main electoral purpose of the
    Republican establishment seems to be to construct an impenetrable firewall during
    primaries between the tea party candidates and the Democrats, no matter what the
    cost."

    next year, with endorsement from Rand.  So maybe this will become a trend, and
    tea-party candidates in 2016 will legally change their names to \"Chris McDaniel\"
    for the duration of their elections?  Heh heh heh.  As bad as this year has been,
    I have hope that this is the knee-bend year, and 2016 and 2018 and especially
    2020 will be the years that liberTea and boilingTea politicians start to have
    control of ~30% of each major branch of the federal govt (including the SCOTUS
    if the sitting judges can make it until 2017 before they retire).  That would
    be enough to get many policies adopted, and start showing unmistakably-real-world
    success."

  content: "Jim, consider me an optimist:  I expect the general election battle to
    be McDaniel vs Childers, in which context the Atlas Shrugged movies make perfect
    sense, and the tea-party folks will have to be hyperactive (since the media will
    try to crush McDaniel and some of the estab-repubs in MS will help do so).  There
    is a very real possibility that McDaniel could win his courtcase, but lose the
    redo-runoff, or if that is avoided, lose to Childers by once again being falsely
    tarred as a racist.  \r\n\r\nIf, as is quite possible (even probable given the
    uphill nature of the battle), McDaniel loses a battle at some point along the
    way, most likely due to the court ruling against him thanks to the wiles of Butler
    Snow lawyers (Haley's lobbying firm is representing team Cochran), then it is
    pretty pointless to show Atlas Shrugged movies in support of *Cochran* versus
    Childers... neither one of them will significantly change the direction Obama
    is heading us towards, one being an estab-repub, the other being a conserva-dem.
    \ I would still recommend the local tea party folks to start hosting movie-nights
    in Mississippi, but the showing of Atlas Shrugged would be more of an educational
    effort, looking forward to the 2015 statewide elections and the 2016 presidential
    primaries, than topical for 2014.  Does this make more sense now?  \r\n\r\nAs
    to your larger points, on our strategy going forward, I strongly disagree that
    we should go scorched-earth in EVERY contest.  And I can tell you why in 13 glyphs:
    \ story-telling.  There were 61m repubs who voted for Romney in 2012.  They were
    the same 60m people who voted for McCain in 2008, more or less.  Most of them
    are low-information-voters.  The vast majority get their info from teevee.  The
    don't participate in primary-elections.  They believe in individual responsibility,
    and in free enterprise, and in equality of opportunity.  Although they disapprove
    of the direction of the country, and have low regard for the folks in DC, they
    do not grok how the system itself is rigged.  Say that a large and angry faction
    of us tea-party-types decide to agree on a scorched-earth strategy, across the
    board.  That means we will be painted as sunshine patriots on FOX, not just as
    crazies on NBC.  Many of the Eisenhower-repubs (talking regular voters here not
    party activists) will not understand.  So the story-telling will be against us,
    if we use the scorched-earth strategy.  \r\n\r\nHow do we make the story-telling
    aspect be on our side?  I think there are a couple ways to do it.  First, we tell
    the story of how big money paid for the race-baiting in Mississippi.  We keep
    telling that story, and we tell it right.  RememberMississippi.  That means, no
    guilt by association, and fair is fair, and give credit where credit is due, and
    give blame when deserved (but no more and no less than is deserved).  Henry Barbour,
    nat'l cmte'man of MS, nephew of gov-slash-lobbyist Haley, was personally responsible
    for funding race-baiting adverts, and later admitted to it (after first denying
    any connection but then getting caught), plus doubled down and said the tea party
    supporters really *do* want to keep minorities from voting.  That makes Henry
    somebody we must vow to defeat; Ed Martin failed to censure him in the RNC, so
    we need to train tea-party-folks in MS on how to unseat Henry Barbour -- and Joe
    Nosef while they are at it -- at the 2016 MSGOP state convention (precinct &amp;
    county delegation-elections were April 28th in the 2012 Mississippi contest but
    the 2016 schedule is \"compressed\" Feb-June instead of Jan-Aug so the date may
    change).  \r\n\r\nWe should NOT give Nosef as much blame as we give Henry.  (For
    that matter, we should not give Haley quite as much blame as Henry... even though
    Haley actively and unabashedly campaigned for Cochran personally, plus donated
    directly to Henry's MsConservativesPac.)  McCain personally campaigned with Cochran,
    praised the tactics, and donated too, so he gets significant blame.  You are in
    Missouri, so you are mad that Roy Blunt was a donor to Cochran, and also directly
    to Henry's PAC.  That is well and good.  But it is important to get it right:
    \ did Blunt donate after 6/3, and especially, after 6/10 when the race-baiting
    adverts started airing?  If so, give blame where blame is due.  Did Blunt know
    about the content of the adverts?  (It seems unlikely but get him on the record.)
    \ Has Blunt publicly stated, like Senator Portman in Ohio, that using race as
    a wedge is wrong, and he would not support his money being used thataway?  If
    not, why not?  Also, to be fair, 90% of sitting repub senators donated to Cochran;
    Blunt should not be unfairly singled out.  Similarly, basically *every* Senator
    supports the NRSC, and many of the 61m low-info repubs do as well; the staffers
    at the NRSC used that money wrongly, but the 61m are not to blame.  \r\n\r\nSurely,
    though, we can tell the story to the 61m, and recommend they do NOT give money
    to the NRSC any more, until and unless the staffers involved are fired, and the
    NRSC vowed to stay out of repub-primary-chanllenges going forwards.  Ditto for
    the RNC, until Henry is off it and the RNC chair apologizes for failing to act
    in timely fashion.  As for Blunt, put the heat on him.  Get him to go on record:
    \ did he support the race-baiting adverts that his money paid for?  Do the same
    for RNC elected folks in Missouri, the state party chair, the national committeeman,
    the nationalcommitteewoman.  Why did they not vote to censure Henry Barbour, at
    the August meeting of the repub natl cmte in Chicago?  Do they support race-baiting
    adverts that Henry Barbour paid for and approves of?  We know the answer for Ed
    Martin (yay), but what about the other two, is my question.  Lance Beshore &amp;
    Susie Eckelkamp.  http://www.gop.com/members/missouri \r\n\r\nAnd hey, now that
    the RNC censure has been denied (once... maybe Martin will bring it up again at
    the next meeting as more evidence -- and more vivid storytelling -- filters to
    the masses), we still have other options.  It would be useful for the SREC of
    Missouri to pass a resolution on the race-baiting tactics in Mississippi, for
    example.  http://www.missouri.gop/state-committee/   And look, Ed Martin and Lance
    Beshore are members.  The RNC is still fundamentally a ground-up operation, with
    the state parties having significant control.  Similarly, the state GOP operations
    are also grassroots-up operations, with the county committees having considerable
    control.  See how many counties you can convince, to pass a resolution censuring
    Henry Barbour's race-baiting tactics.  That will make the SREC pay attention.
    \ That in turn will make the RNC pay attention, especially if other states do
    the same.  Perhaps most importantly of all, that will tell us whether the folks
    that are local county chairs, local precinct chairs, and SREC members for the
    repub pty of Missouri, will stand on principle... or will instead toe the party
    line.  There are upcoming elections for Missouri GOP seats, too.  The RNC has
    already \"inquired\" about the dates for unseating Ed Martin, remember; they may
    be in for a shock, if instead of Ed Martin leaving, a wave of tea shows up at
    the next presidential nominating convention.  \r\n\r\nAnyways, sorry about the
    long response; hope you are finding it useful.  In a nutshell, what we should
    concentrate on doing is not a scorched-earth policy, that we will never support
    anybody who is not Ted Cruz / Rand Paul / Chris McDaniel / etc.  That is a bad
    idea from a story-telling perspective, and also mathematically, Duverger's law
    shows that in our kind of electoral system, the *only* thing that works is controlling
    one of the dominant parties.  Right now, the estab-repubs control the party of
    Reagan.  Right now, you are correct, the *main* goal of estab-repubs is to weaken
    the tea.  They don't care if dems get elected as a result; they will just tell
    the (false &amp; lying ... but backed up by teevee news) story that the *tea*
    folks are responsible for the 2014 losses, if only they had rallied around Thad....
    \r\n\r\nNo, we have only one pragmatic option:  we must retake the party of Reagan
    from within.  That means getting and holding precinct-chairs.  That means getting
    and holding county-chairs.  That means getting and holding seats on the county
    election commission.  There are more of us, than their are of estab-lackeys.  More
    importantly, most of the 61m people that vote repubs, would be on our side, if
    they only knew the truth.  We must tell them the truth, and then get them to help
    us retake the party.  If we control the counties, we will also control the state
    conventions, which means we will be able to elect good people to the SREC and
    to the RNC, and send good delegates to the presidential conventions, and make
    sure that the elections are certified PROPERLY without fraud.  \r\n\r\nWe should
    never stoop to the estab-repub level, and use our future control of the party
    to \"win\" at any costs.  For one thing, we don't have to!  Their ideas are wrong,
    whereas our ideas are right; balancing the budget with the penny plan (NOT with
    new taxes), and then inverting the deficit so we can pay down the debt to ~10%gdp
    over the next generation or so, is not extreme / crazy / wingnut.  Sane monetary
    policy is not, either.  Cut the size of government to 10%gdp, and cut the size
    of debt to 10%gdp, and liberty and freedom will necessarily result.  The welfare
    state is a *bad* story; ours is a good story.  \r\n\r\nThere is one exception
    to the scorched-earth policy, that I would support:  we will never support a dem
    candidate who calls the tea party (or repub party) inherently racist, or says
    the tea party (or repub party) wants to keep minorities from voting.  Those people
    are beneath our contempt, just as the pro-segregation dems of the 1900s, and the
    pro-slavery dems of the 1800s, are beneath the contempt of the repub party.  We
    should apply the same exact rule to repub candidates.  But we should apply the
    rule carefully, not wildly.  Thad Cochran never personally said such things.  But
    his team paid people to say such things, and his affiliated PACs now have doubled
    down to back him up.  There is an election-challenge lawsuit in progress; when
    it is over, the evidence of race-baiting will be plain for all to see.  If Cochran
    sees the evidence, acknowledges it was wrong, fires the people involved, and disassociates
    from them going forward, plus apologizes to McDaniel in particular and the tea
    party in general for his name being used atop race-baiting adverts... well then,
    quite frankly, that would be a big step toward re-unifying the party.  \r\n\r\nHowever,
    if Cochran takes the tacit approval by silence approach, then some sort of scorched
    earth is merited, in my book.  I probably could not bring myself to vote for Childers,
    and staying at home is not an option either (that is exactly what the estab-repubs
    want us to do!).  But I would never vote for somebody who stood by while evil
    was being done, knowing it was evil, and if not being able to reverse time and
    stop it, at least apologizing.  Candidates who tar the tea folks as racist, should
    expect we'll leave their line on the ballot blank, or vote for the Libertarian/Constitution/Reform/somesuch
    candidate in their race, if a good egg happens to be running as such.  Those numbers
    will show up, in the overall totals; people paying attention will see the impact
    of this surgically-scorched-earth tactic.  \r\n\r\nOne final note, and then I
    really will stop:  words mean things, as Reagan knew, and we modern tea folks
    must remember that.  There is not a clear split between dems and repubs, as we
    know; many repubs are dempubs, RINOs, estab-repubs, etc.  Some dems, like Childers
    and Manchin and Matheson, are pretty squishy too:  they don't always vote like
    Elizabeth Warren.  (Mia Love was still gonna beat Matheson though, which is why
    he dropped out of the running in Utah.)  We need to start thinking in percentages;
    set Senator Obama at 0%, and Senator Warren at -15%, and Senator Manchin at 30%
    or so.  The same applies to repubs:  Collins is 40%, Cochran is around 55%, Blunt
    is 70%, McConnell is 85%, Cornyn is 90%, Rand/Cruz/Lee/Scott are 95+%.  Plenty
    of people this year have been trying to call Cornyn and especially McConnell estab-repubs.
    \ That is true, in the sense that, they both donated to Cochran, they both toe
    the party line, and they both are not really tea-party-types.  But they both have
    decent voting-records, which counts more than rhetoric for me.  Sure, Stockman
    is 110% boiling tea, but that's only a gain of +20% over Cornyn.  By contrast,
    McDaniel at 95% tea would be a +40% gain over Cochran, a far more important upgrade.
    \ Bevin was only about 90% tea (he took TARP bailout money) in my book, which
    is +5% gain over McConnell; pretty paltry.  That's not to say Bevin and Stockman
    shouldn't have run; they helped put pressure on the incumbents, to watch their
    steps.  \r\n\r\nThat's also not to say McConnell 85% is \"good enough\"... just
    that it is better than Blunt 70% which in turn is better than Cochran 55% which
    in turn is 'better' than Childers 40% (unless unapologetic race-baiting is involved
    that is).  Tea party folks tend to be high-information-voters, but we also tend
    to fall into the dem-trap of abusing the English language, conflating things,
    hyperbole, and so on.  We need to be surgical in our language.  Dems hate that;
    estab-repubs hate that.  For instance, Jeff Sessions, who is strong enough tea
    that he had *no* challenger this year in deep red Alabama, actually has a voting
    record of 83% or so, like McConnell rather than ~95% like Cruz/Rand/Lee/Scott/McDaniel.
    \ Sessions is a legitimate tea party candidate; he did not donate to Cochran,
    for example.  But he could be doing better.  Tea folks need to use precise language,
    so we are not fooled.  Look at Shannon vs Langford in Oklahoma; Shannon was the
    91%-rated tea-repub, and Langford was the 73%-rated estab-repub, but the voters
    there were fooled into thinking Langford was \"just as\" much a conservative tea-party
    type as Shannon.  The estab-repub strategy is to lie their way to \"victory\"
    over the tea party folks:  call Brat a \"liberal college prof\" in Virginia (backfired),
    call Langford \"just as conservative\" in Oklahoma (worked), call McDaniel a racist
    in Mississippi (REALLY backfired).  \r\n\r\nEstab repubs love to call themselves
    \"conservative\" to trick the low-info-voter.  And hey, Thad Cochran *is* ever
    so slightly more \"conservative\" than Childers, by about +15% or so.  But McDaniel
    is more conservative than Childers by +55% or so, and in a PVI+9 state, would
    still easily win.  (By contrast, Collins at 40% in Maine is about the best we
    can hope for right now.)  When you look at it numerically, you can see that Cochran
    is a \"conservative\" who is equally close to conserva-dem Childers as he is to
    estab-repub Roy Blunt.  In other words, Cochran is a porker and a compromiser;
    Blunt is a \"mainstream\" semi-porker estab-repub, who is midway between McConnell
    and Cochran.  McConnell is a tight-hawk-estab-repub, something like Newt; still
    a pretty big spender albeit not a porker, still pretty weak on the Constitution,
    about midway between Roy Blunt and Rand Paul / Ted Cruz / etc.  It will not be
    easy to use precise language, going forward; the tea party is a distributed movement,
    and some folks care about fiscal matters, some about Constitutional matters, some
    about foreign policy matters, and some about social issues... most of us care
    about all of them, but prioritize uniquely.  Unifying our terminology will be
    tough.  Still, it is important we try to be precise; how *much* of an estab-repub
    is Cochran, compared to McConnell?  How much of an estab-dem is Childers, compared
    to Hillary?  If we are going to get angry about being unfairly tarred as racists,
    it is only fair we try to be careful ourselves, and not tar *all* squishy repubs
    as no-better-than-the-dems.  We should quantify the 'squish' percentage:  that
    will help us, plus thwart estab-repub lies.  \r\n\r\nThanks, and keep up the good
    work.  Chris Z. McDaniel (CCBYSA3 license)"

  content: "Something we all need to keep in mind when debating our \"opponents\"
    - whether they be Democrats, establishment Republicans, or the leftists mainstream
    press - is that we will rareley, if ever, change their minds no matter how lock-tight
    logical of an argument we make.  A  debate \"victory\" for us needs to be defined
    in terms of bringing more people to our way of thinking on the need and benefit
    for smaller, limited government while our opponents spout the virtues of big government,
    or - in the case of the establishment Republicans - the virtuers of their actions
    when they vote to support big goernment while talking against it.\r\n\r\nThe essence
    of Bill's argument here is that those \"spectators\" on the sidelines, essentially
    the voters who are the ones we really want to convince, tend to not listen to
    shouters.  None of us really do.  We will never convince the like of Roy Blunt
    or his boss, Crusher  McConnell, the error of their ways when they vote for corporate
    subsidies and handouts any more than we will convince McCaskill and Pelosi that
    the nanny state isn't a good thing.  What we CAN do, is convince the majority
    of voters that our limited government argument is in their best interest and motivate
    them to vote the big government establishment incumbents out of office.  This
    will take time, but it's win-able; what isn't win-able is convincing incumbent
    politicians of the error of their way by having a better argument in a single
    debate. \r\n\r\nWe need to always keep our true audience in mind and, as Bill
    suggests here, stop shouting.  It turns off the people we are really attempting
    to reach."

<p>I shout a lot.</p>
<p>Not with my lungs. With my pen. Well, not a pen, actually. With a wireless Bluetooth keyboard.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I shouted with my lungs at Tea Party events. I realized pretty quickly that shouting wasn't doing any good. It worked at first. Shouting carried my voice to people who thought "no one believes what I believe." Some people heard me yelling at the Arch and came out to see what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>"What's that guy yelling about," they asked the crowd.</p>
<p>"TARP," someone answered.</p>
<p>"What about TARP?" the newcomer asked.</p>
<p>"He's against it."</p>
<p>"Well, I must be in right place."</p>
<p>Pretty soon, though, everybody who was against TARP was out of the house and in the street. Then we started yelling about Obamacare. This brought out a few more people. At some point, a full 21 percent of American adults were yelling with us.</p>
<p>Then, I got tired of yelling. For one thing, my throat hurt. For another, I noticed our yelling wasn't attracting any new faces. Everyone had heard what we had to say, and the ones who believed what we believed had come out to yell with us. Like wolves baying at a full moon.</p>
<p>We could find new things to yell about which might attract a few new people. This might also drive away some of the TARP people, though. Todd Akin tried this. And worked. A lot of people who don't normally vote showed up to vote against him. And a lot of people who normally vote Republican either undervoted the Senate race or voted for McCaskill. (At least, that's what they told me when their wives were around.)</p>
<p>No, &nbsp;I think it's safer to stick with&nbsp;a few things that we really, really believe. The things we first yelled about. Things like bailing out billionaire banksters, nationalizing&nbsp;private companies that make cars that kill people, and borrowing trillions of dollars to distract the kids from the trillions in debt we've already asked them to pay off. (Something tells me the kids wouldn't have enjoyed the trip to Disneyland if they'd known we used <em>their</em> credit cards to finance it.)</p>
<p>I just looked at my Twitter timeline and realized I'm still shouting. But I don't know why.</p>
<p><a title="Why Is Erick Erickson Protecting Reince Priebus?" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/09/erick-erickson-reince-priebus/">I shouted at Erick Erickson t</a>he other day. I feel better, but I'm not sure I accomplished anything.</p>
<p>Then, I opened up my Kindle version of P.J. O'Rourke's fabulous work <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802145434/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802145434&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hennesssview-20">Don't Vote It Just Encourages the Bastards</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802145434" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. Here's what I read:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't think drugs are bad. I used to be a hippie. I think drugs are fun. Now I'm a conservative. I think fun is bad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, not that. I mean, yeah, I read that. And highlighted it, because it's hillarious. But that's not the part that triggered this blog. It was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>My laugh was followed by an uneasy thought. Who was Rush Limbaugh shouting at? Was he shouting at Wesley Clark? I doubted that Clark listened to AM talk radio the way I listened to NPR, to get his blood pressure up. Besides, Howard Dean was already doing that for Clark. Was Rush Limbaugh shouting at uncommitted voters, hoping to scare them into the George W. Bush camp? Shouting "Hillary Clinton!" "Howard Dean!" "John Kerry!" over and over might have done it. But what uncommitted voter cared a spit about Wesley Clark? The person hearing the shout had to know enough about Democratic politics to know who Wesley Clark was and enough about Wesley Clark to know that he was a small pumpkin and a false alarm. Was Rush Limbaugh shouting at Hillary Clinton supporters to hearten them? At Dean supporters to energize them? At Kerry supporters to alert them? These people didn't tend to be ditto heads. No, I realized, Rush Limbaugh was shouting at me.</p></blockquote>
<p>That paragraph hit me. When I shout on Twitter, I'm shouting you. But you knew that. So I'll let O'Rourke explain it, since he went to Harvard and I went to Fontbonne:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me. I am to the right of . . . Why is the Attila benchmark always used? Fifth-century Hunnish depredations upon the Roman empire were the work of an overpowerful centralization of authority with little respect for property rights, pursuing a policy of economic redistribution in an atmosphere of permissive social mores.</p>
<p>I am a little to the right of Rush Limbaugh. I'm so conservative that I could talk Ellen DeGeneres out of supporting gay marriage. Gays wed, they buy a house, they have children, they encounter our public school system. Then gays vote Republican.</p>
<p>After I'd realized, in 2003, who Rush Limbaugh was shouting at, I performed an experiment. I listened to some more talk radio, watched some conservative television programming, and read some of the conservative books that were popular at the time. I listened to Michael Savage and Mark Levin. I watched Bill O'Reilly's <em>No Spin Zone</em> and the Sean Hannity part of <em>Hannity and Colmes</em>. They did a lot of shouting. But they didn't seem to be shouting at the potentially repentant sinner who had guiltily slipped in at the back of the congregation after emptying his bottle of malt liquor. Nor did they seem to be shouting at the abashed political wire puller in the middle pews, his conscience botherd by the electoral blood on his hands. No, Limbaugh, Savage, Levin, O'Reilly, Hannity, et al. were shouting at the pious women in the big hats standing blamelessly in the choir. That is, they were shouting at&mdash;with a change of gender and headgear&mdash;me.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know I'm no Rush Limbaugh, but I recognized myself in O'Rouke's words. I also recognized the left-to-right political migration&nbsp;of Irish and Jews&mdash;O'Rourke, Hannity, O'Reilly, Hennessy, Savage, Levin. When I was a kid,&nbsp;Irish and Jews&nbsp;all liberals, weren't we? All the conservatives were English. Or Austrian. Except for Buckley, but he went to school in England, which is probably where the conversion happened.</p>
<p>If you were hoping for something profound, I think it's time to warn you that I began writing immediately after reading the paragraphs I just copied from <em>Don't Vote</em>. I realize now that I should have thought more, but here I am. Let's make the best of it as we take this journey together. A journey that might end anywhere. Strap on your headgear and get ready to march.</p>
<h3>Shouting: Who's It Good For?</h3>
<p>Except for alerting others who already believe what we believe, what good does shouting do? Many of us have stories of converting friends or family to our way of thinking, but did we shout them into compliance? If so, how long will their conversion hold?</p>
<p>And we probably didn't conservatism into them by strapping them to a chair and reading The Federalist Papers. Or Common Sense. Or The Wealth of Nations or The 5000 Year Leap or Democracy in America or The Road to Serfdom or any of the other books that we form support groups to discuss.</p>
<p>Yes, our converts might read those books. Eventually. But the reading of our sacred texts is a symptom of conversion, not a cause. Maybe a symptom of doubt in their prior beliefs. If Al Franken were to take a year off to read the abridged version of The Road Serfdom, he wouldn't become a conservative. He'd write "bullshit" in the margins 348 times. And he'd scribble down little snippets of the work out of context that he'd repeat endlessly to show the world that Hayek was a narrow, stupid, racist elitist who liked cutting the fins off fish and throw them back into the pond. "The semi-colon is racist," I can hear Franken shouting, "and Hayek used seven of them one page alone!"</p>
<p>I know why we shout. It feels good. I don't know what we expect shouting to accomplish. If you have some strategy for shouting, please share it in the comments. But also share some empirical evidence that shouting works.</p>
<p>Instead of shouting, what if we found a way to <em>show</em> people what life is like at the end of the road to serfdom? How would we show that? How could we help people feel that? How might they experience serfdom? What if we began with them?</p>
<p>Sure, there are some people, like Al Franken, who won't be converted. But there's a big group of people who vote wrong because they don't know any better. They're not hardcore leftists, especially Millennials, as <a href="http://reason.com/poll" target="_blank">Reason Magainze discovered in a recent survey</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">Twenty-five percent of millennials identify as liberal, compared to only 14% of Americans over 30. However, most millennials are&nbsp;<a style="color: #f37221;" href="http://reason.com/poll/2014/07/16/millennials-arent-more-democratictheyre">basing their choices on</a><a style="color: #f37221;" title="social issues" href="http://reason.com/poll/2014/07/17/social-issues-not-economics-largely-defi">social issues</a>, which they prioritize over economics when making political judgments. When we investigate liberal millennials, the report shows that only about a&nbsp;<a style="color: #f37221;" title="third" href="http://reason.com/poll/2014/07/17/social-issues-not-economics-largely-defi">third</a>&nbsp;of respondents describe their own liberalism in both social and economic terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One-third of one-quarter is . . . a relatively small number (0.0825). So ignore that eight percent. They're Franken material. There's hope for the other 92 percent.</p>
<p>Reason found even more contradictions in their poll:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">This pattern plays out in policy stances too. Millennials tend to favor a larger,&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #f37221;" title="more active government" href="http://reason.com/poll/2014/07/10/what-millennials-think-government-should">more active government</a><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;with more guarantees, and are&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #f37221;" title="more sympathetic to socialism" href="http://reason.com/poll/2014/07/16/millennials-dont-know-what-socialism-mea">more sympathetic to socialism</a><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;than older generations. But this isn&rsquo;t absolute. When millennials are educated about the concrete trade-offs these policies entail,&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #f37221;" href="http://reason.com/poll/2014/07/10/millennial-support-for-redistribution-an">their support drops dramatically</a><span style="color: #000000;">, even closing common</span><a style="color: #f37221;" title="racial gaps" href="http://reason.com/poll/2014/07/10/millennials-prefer-small-government-if-l">racial gaps</a><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;in the process.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>So how do we reach them, if not with hard, cold, boring, difficult to memorize facts?</p>
<p>George Orwell did it with 1984 and even Animal Farm. But nobody reads those books anymore. Or they're guided in their reading by teachers who explain that Big Brother is actually Apple or IBM or George Bush and that the Department of Justice&nbsp;is Your Friend protecting your from abuses by these corporations.</p>
<p>Facts convince no one of anything, as science has shown again and again. But stories do. Because stories let us feel and experience. Great stories turn off our thinking caps and suspend our disbelief and let us feel what it would be like to be the character looking up at the etchings on the Ministry of Truth. Later, after we've felt something, the facts&nbsp;justify our new "beliefs."</p>
<p>Back to my original question: what if we stopped shouting?</p>
