  content: "Great ideal Hennessy! My heart breaks for these dear folks. Spending our
    $ at these stores is a grand step in the right direction. I'm in! \r\nThis is
    showing love like Dr. King said: 'Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do
    that.'"

  content: "This is a great idea. I hope those participating have the opportunity
    to meet in one spot, so that perhaps we can shop in small (or large) groups.  Shopping
    will make a statement, but I would hope that the shop owners and the community
    of Ferguson would know what we are doing and why.\r\n\r\nIf the news could pick
    up the story, maybe several hundred more will BuyCott Ferguson over time.\r\n\r\nWho
    knows?  Perhaps even some local contractors will come in and donate time and materials
    to repair the shops.  Maybe some of the suppliers to the stores will offer a one
    time free \"stock-up\" to help them recover some losses.\r\n\r\nWho do we know
    in the contracting / business sector willing to show Ferguson that there are good
    people in the world interested in helping?"

  content: This will give you a self-selected subset of the purchasers, which is useful
    but incomplete.  Recommend you also ask the store-owners for day-by-day revenue
    breakdowns from the week leading up to your buycott, and the week following your
    buycott.  You can see if there is a correlation with the buying-curve of your
    buycott receipts (which are all datestamped and tied to particular businesses)
    with the revenue-curve as reported by the particular businesses.

  content: Thanks for the suggestion. I'd like that level of accuracy, but I don't
    want to put any additional burden on them. I'd rather have incomplete data than
    make them jump through hoops. Also, it's impossible to eliminate unknown variables,
    meaning, a bump in sales might be the buycott--or it might be a return of peace
    and calm to the area. Or people running out of stuff.

<p><strong>DON'T STOP SHOPPING!</strong></p>
<p>The Buycott is underway. Great turnout on Thursday. Fantastic support from the media. Even Senator Claire McCaskill joined the buycott. <a title="Why St. Louis Tea Party Went to Ferguson To Shop" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/21/why-st-louis-tea-party-went-to-ferguson-to-shop/">Read all about it here.</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, keep shopping Ferguson/Dellwood if you get the chance. And make an appointment on your calendar to shop Ferguson/Dellwood on Labor Day Weekend. Have out-of-town guests? Take them on a tour and have a meal in one of the great restaurants in the area.</p>
<p>Wherever you live in Greater St. Louis, the world judges your home town by what it hears. Let the world hear that Ferguson came back stronger than it went into the terrible riots of the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, find out how you can help get a <a title="ACTION: Tell Missouri Legislature to Pass Tax Holiday for Ferguson" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/23/action-tell-missouri-legislature-pass-tax-holiday-ferguson/">Sales Tax Holiday for Ferguson/Dellwood.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LATEST UPDATES: 20AUG14 @ 8:14AM</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Dress for very hot weather and hydrate.</li>
<li>If you can't make it today, that's okay. See step 3.</li>
<li>After your shopping spree, please email photos of your receipts to bill.hennessy@stlouisteaparty.com using the subject line "Ferguson Receipt."</li>
<li>After shopping, we'll be heading to <a href="http://fallonspub.com/" target="_blank">Fallon's Bar &amp; Grill in Overland</a>.</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="http://www.971talk.com/blogs/allmans-electric-stove/demand-audio" target="_blank">Jamie Allman 97.1</a>, <a href="http://www.indioradio.com/index.php?104" target="_blank">John &amp; Kane Show</a>,<a href="http://culturevigilante.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> Lisa Payne-Naeger</a>, <a href="http://kmox.com" target="_blank">KMOX's Brett Blume,</a> and everyone else who's helped spread the word.</li>
<li>Please remember, this BUYcott is in the name of peace and prosperity. Smile. Those are both good things.</li>
</ol>
<p>*****Original Post Follows*****</p>
<p>Thursday, August 21, 5:00 to 6:00&nbsp;pm.</p>
<p>Dozens of Ferguson businesses have suffered damage. Not only do those businesses need healing, their customers need their services.</p>
<h3>We can help. BUYcott Ferguson.</h3>
<p>Just as <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/12/04/favorite-st-louis-tea-party-wasnt-tea-party/" target="_blank">we helped Whole Foods by BUYcotting September 1, 2009</a>, we can help small businesses in Ferguson by BUYcotting Thursday, August 21, 5 to 6:30 pm.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to W. Florissant on Thursday between 5 and 6:30.</li>
<li>Bring a shopping list: groceries, beer, smokes, something for the kids, whatever</li>
<li>Look for businesses with boarded up windows and spray painted OPEN signs</li>
<li>Shop</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why You Should Do This</h3>
<p>Because there's not much else you and I can do right now. Yeah, protests feel good in the moment, but they don't really change things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every store you shop will be one step closer to recovery. Every store that recovers makes life easier for residents. Every life made easier gets you one step closer to heaven. And that's the only reason we're here.</p>
<p>Please watch HennessysView.com in the coming days for more details. Pray for this mission. It'll work.</p>
<p>I'd like to see 20 people join this demonstration of faith, healing, and free markets. Everything over that is gravy.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: DETAILS</strong></p>
<p>First, thanks for the great response. I'm excited.</p>
<p>Next, here's the details for Thursday:</p>
<ol>
<li>The situation is fluid, and we don't want to interfere with police OR with peaceful demonstrators. So WATCH THIS BLOG AND YOUR EMAIL on Thursday in case things change.</li>
<li>Some stores might be low on inventory. If it looks that way, ask. We don't want to leave local residents without stuff that we can buy somewhere else. With the traffic restrictions, Ferguson residents have a hard time getting out to distant shops.</li>
<li>NO SIGNS OR SPEECHES. We're not their proselytize or politic. We're their to lead recovery, healing, faith, and free markets.</li>
<li>MUSTER on the Sam's Club lot, southeast corner, around 5:00 pm. If you'd like to start earlier, please don't wait. Here's a link to the map:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sam's+Club/@38.7651138,-90.2786401,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xee35e1a60eda7589" target="_blank">Sam's Club,&nbsp;10735 W Florissant Ave&nbsp;Ferguson, MO 63136</a></li>
</ol>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">5. OBEY POLICE and respect peaceful demonstrators. We have been in their shoes many times together in the past.</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">6. SMILE and be friendly. It's been a hard week and a half in Ferguson, and a friendly smile will go a long way.&nbsp;</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">7. &nbsp;Listen to Jamie in the Morning at 6:10 am Wednesday for the latest updates.</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">8. &nbsp;We'll designate a post BUYcott meeting spot tomorrow if you'd like to get together for a little After Party. I'll update this post.</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">9. &nbsp;Thank you, again. You are wonderful people.</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">Finally, I read a story not long ago about a man who jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge. He passed about 40 people as he walked to a spot on the bridge. He looked around for a few minutes as more people rushed passed. Then he jumped.</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">When police investigated his apartment, they found a note. Among other thoughts, the jumper wrote: "If one person smiles at me, I won't do it."</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">You never know how your friendly smile will change a life. Or save one.&nbsp;</address>
<address class="cards-entity-title cards-strong cards-text-truncate-and-wrap" style="color: #333333;">God bless you.&nbsp;</address>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
