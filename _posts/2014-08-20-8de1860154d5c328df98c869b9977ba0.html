<p>Bill,</p>
<p>You state "It means politicians will have to stop throwing bones to poor neighborhoods and start charting real solutions that return business to a region in economic decline. (Yes, St. Louis City and County are falling fast on almost every measure of economic well-being.) It means political people of all stripes will have to spend less time schmoozing the rich and famous and more time building a real community."</p>
<p>You are not the only blogger who is insisting, the communities, politicians, local governments should "do something" to better the conditions in Ferguson and other localities.    Yet I've not yet heard any specific suggestions from anyone regarding what these groups should do.  So far, you're one of the few who have not blamed "privileged whites" for the problems.   And I've yet to hear anyone even suggest that one of the big problems lies within the family structure -- of whites and blacks who are directionless, lack personal responsibility,  and more often than not low self esteem under the cover of bravado and even criminal actions.  People who are not taught the traits of self-discipline, responsibility, and desire to attain goals that will enable them to offer valuable skills in the job market.   Creating jobs for those who don't have those skills will not improve anyone's situation.</p>
<p>Cleaning up the municipal courts and law enforcement in certain communities is one step toward building a healthy relationship with the citizens of those communities.   But how do we create within those citizens of a community who have not been taught how to set and attain goals that will lead them to attaining employment, self sufficiency, pride in their accomplishments, and allow them to give back to their community?<br />
