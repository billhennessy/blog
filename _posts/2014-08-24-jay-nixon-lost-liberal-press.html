  content: Governor Jay Nixon is upset at the release of the video showing Michael
    Brown committing the strong-arm robbery. Nixon on &ldquo;Meet the Press&rdquo;
    said, "Rest assured we have had very serious discussions about that action [releasing
    the video] and its effect on Brown's family.&rdquo; What?  The video clearly shows
    Michael Brown was not an &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; babe or the &ldquo;gentle&rdquo;
    giant they portrayed him to be, but instead Brown was an intimidating, aggressive
    bully, which leads one to believe that is how he acted when confronted by the
    police officer. It is the TRUTH, but does not fit the narrative and so people
    like Nixon did not want it revealed. Then they have the nerve calling for &ldquo;justice.&rdquo;
    How is that justice when they want to hide Brown&rsquo;s true demeanor?  The POLITICIANS&rsquo;,
    without knowing all the facts of this case, have made biased comments giving the
    impression that the officer will be indicted. And the "protesters&rdquo; will
    not be satisfied unless the officer is indicted. So, what do you think will happen
    to this town if the officer is not indicted, because of the rhetoric coming from
    these 'politicians?" That is why it is best to wait to for the investigation to
    be completed, instead of jumping to conclusions and a rush to judgment. Unfortunately,
    the black activists&rsquo; definition of justice is not justice, but just-us with
    a lynch mob mentality.

  content: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in control
    of policing in Ferguson led by a black captain. Would that not be a racist move?
    Is Nixon saying only blacks can police other blacks? What does that move by Nixon
    say to the policemen?

  content: And the circus continues in Ferguson with an unruly conference with elected
    officials and the Highway Patrol. At the conference Governor Nixon declared a
    State of Emergency with a 12 midnight to 5am curfew. That is not sitting well
    with the lynch mob who attended this conference. The mob is calling for &ldquo;justice&rdquo;
    and demanding the officer to be arrested. Lacey Clay informed the crowd he is
    seeking a Civil Rights violation from the Eric Holder&rsquo;s DOJ against the
    officer. When asked how the curfew was going to be enforced Captain Johnson said
    they would not use force, but instead ask the people to leave and continue to
    ask them to leave until they leave. What?? These protesters are not seeking JUSTICE,
    they are seeking revenge and have a lynch mob mentality. What these fools should
    have told the crowd is the investigation in ongoing and the people should wait
    till the investigation is completed, instead of jumping to conclusions. Furthermore,
    any criminal behavior would be dealt with immediately and the perpetrators arrested
    and taken away. Just because Obama is lawless, does not mean St. Louis has to
    be lawless. What I question is why are there still protests when the protesters
    have been told of all that is being done?

  content: Jay Nixon, the thieving Governor of Missouri, who stole money from the
    Children&rsquo;s Trust Fund to pay his governor&rsquo;s dues, made more irresponsible
    comments, without knowing all the facts of this case, when he called for &ldquo;vigorous&rdquo;
    prosecution i.e. an indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael
    Brown. Apparently, Nixon has succumbed to the lynch mob when he says he wants
    justice for the Brown family. Unfortunately, the black activists&rsquo; and fools
    like Nixon the definition of justice is not justice, but just-us with a lynch
    mob mentality. These &ldquo;protesters&rdquo; want an indictment, a conviction
    and an execution. If it was up to them Officer Wilson would be swinging from a
    tree.  There is a video that clearly shows Michael Brown was not an &ldquo;innocent&rdquo;
    babe or the &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; giant they portrayed him to be, but instead Brown
    was an intimidating, aggressive bully, which leads one to believe that is how
    he acted when confronted by the police officer. The video shows the TRUTH about
    Michael Brown, but does not fit the narrative and people like Nixon did not want
    it revealed. Then they have the nerve calling for &ldquo;justice.&rdquo; How is
    that justice when they want to hide Brown&rsquo;s true demeanor?  Justice is supposed
    to be blind. In this country there is the presumption of innocence, which includes
    the police officer. The "protesters&rdquo; will not be satisfied unless the officer
    is indicted. So, what do you think will happen to this town if the officer is
    not indicted, because of the rhetoric coming from these &ldquo;politicians&rdquo;
    like Nixon? That is why it is best to wait to for the investigation to be completed,
    instead of jumping to conclusions and a rush to judgment.

  content: There is evidence that Nixon can and should be impeached. In the last legislative
    session there were 3 Representative vacancies and 1 State Senate vacancy that
    Nixon did not fill. Therefore, the people were not represented. Nixon also stole
    money from the Children's Fund to pay for his governor's dues. These are impeachable
    offenses. The House and Senate have Republican veto proof majorities, but nothing
    was done.

Heh-heggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! It&rsquo;s one of those ungodly contralto cackles somewhere out there in the audience. It&rsquo;s a sound from down so deep, from under so many lavish layers, he knows&nbsp;exactly what she must look like. Two hundred pounds, if she&rsquo;s an ounce! Built like an oil burner! The cackle sets off the men. They erupt with those belly sounds he hates so much. They go, &ldquo;Hehhehheh&hellip;unnnnhhhh-hunhhh&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right&hellip; Tell &rsquo;em, bro&hellip;Yo&hellip;&rdquo; Chuck! The insolent&mdash; he&rsquo;s right there , right there in the front&mdash; he just called him a Charlie! Chuck is short for Charlie, and Charlie is the old code name for a down-home white bigot. The insolence of it! The impudence! The heat and glare are terrific. It makes the Mayor squint. It&rsquo;s the TV lights. He&rsquo;s inside a blinding haze. He can barely make out the heckler&rsquo;s face. He sees a tall silhouette and the fantastic bony angles the man&rsquo;s elbows make when he throws his hands up in the air. And an earring. The man has a big gold earring in one ear. The Mayor leans into the microphone and says, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what. Okay? I&rsquo;ll give you the actual figures. Okay?&rdquo; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your figures, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man, he says! The insolence! &ldquo;You brought it up, my friend. So you&rsquo;re gonna get the actual figures. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you shine us up with no more your figures!&rdquo; Another eruption in the crowd, louder this time: &ldquo;Unnnnh-unnnnh-unnnh&hellip;Tell&rsquo;im, bro&hellip; Y&rsquo; on the</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, Governor Jay Nixon seriously thought he'd be the next President of the United States. Now, he'll be lucky to survive his final two years in office.</p>
<h3>Bill McClellan: Nixon's Cheerleader</h3>
<p>Post-Dispatch columnist Bill McClellan has been the de facto chairman of the Committee to Elect Nixon President since as far back as 2012.</p>
<p>In October, 2012, <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/bill-mcclellan/bill-mcclellan-jay-nixon-could-make-presidential-bid-in/article_21c02e01-1968-5a2e-8758-f6d0f2405cb3.html" target="_blank">following Obama's brutal first debate performance</a>, McClellan wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">With President Barack Obama's surprisingly listless performance in the presidential debate Wednesday night, the stars are coming closer into alignment for Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Most Missourians seem oblivious to the fact that Nixon is on the short list for potential Democratic nominees in 2016. Maybe it's because we tend to think of presidents as larger-than-life characters, and we know Nixon too well to think of him that way. He's been around forever.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Grab a bottle of Pepto-Bismal and read the whole <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/bill-mcclellan/bill-mcclellan-jay-nixon-could-make-presidential-bid-in/article_21c02e01-1968-5a2e-8758-f6d0f2405cb3.html" target="_blank">fawning, slobbering, leg-tingling piece</a>. That column set off a national wave of speculation among Democrats hoping for a mainstream alternative to Hillary in 2016.&nbsp;As recently as March of this year, <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/bill-mcclellan/mcclellan-smart-man-that-jay-nixon/article_cb7655c3-862c-5564-be76-878f7565ed49.html" target="_blank">McClellan continued to brag about Jay Nixon's "smarts."<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15339" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/fergusonriots1-300x159.jpg" alt="fergusonriots1" width="300" height="159" /></a></p>
<p>It must have pained Bill to see Nixon's political future turned into a looted, rioted, charred shell of its former self--like the QuikTrip on W. Florissant.</p>
<p>I won't be too hard on Bill, though. He seems to have had a bona fide&nbsp;friendship with Nixon predating Nixon's rise to the governor's mansion. Friends can't be objective.</p>
<h3>Bonfire of the Democrats</h3>
<p>When <a href="http://hennessysview.com/author/leepresser/">Lee Presser</a> implored me to watch Nixon's painful press conference last weekend in Ferguson, I thought of Tom Wolfe's brilliant prologue to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GYEGNO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003GYEGNO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;linkId=I2Y2DSNPTYYHEWNE">The Bonfire of the Vanities: A Novel</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003GYEGNO" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />.</p>
<p>In the prologue, a fictional New York mayor goes to Harlem and loses the audience. Here's where Jay Nixon lost his political future.</p>
<p><span style="color: #444444;">[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7GwbPEPVsY&amp;start=846&amp;end=1018]</span></p>
<p>That was it. Flash! Bang! Nixon's career gone. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7GwbPEPVsY">See the whole press conference here</a>.)</p>
<p>Sure, he'd already come under fire for escaping the Ferguson situation at the Missouri State Fair. He tried to make up for his lack of leadership (cowardice, according to Maria Chappelle-Nadal) by appointing the Ferguson native Captain Ron Johnson as head of the Ferguson task force.</p>
<p>But Johnson's moves<a href="http://stlouisteaparty.com/2014/08/what-i-saw-at-the-ferguson-riots-video/" target="_blank"> might have made the situation worse</a>. While Johnson moved some of the heavy military hardware out of sight, he also allowed looters free reign of Ferguson. Then Nixon imposed a curfew after Ferguson and Dellwood businesses had been destroyed.</p>
<p>That led <a href="http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/08/14/jay-nixon-ferguson-race-police-shooting/" target="_blank">USAToday to remind us that Nixon continued to leave the door open to a presidential run</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #333333;">The St. Louis suburb has been in turmoil since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death by a police officer on Saturday. &nbsp;Nixon&rsquo;s statement and announcement that he will be in North St. Louis County on Thursday came after the Democrat&nbsp;was criticized as missing in action&nbsp;as tensions escalated between protesters and Ferguson police.</p>
<p style="color: #333333;">The denunciation of Nixon comes as he is being mentioned as a possible presidential or vice presidential candidate on the 2016 Democratic ticket.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Washington in the Rear View Mirror</h3>
<p>Nixon's Washington ambitions are running away from him faster than he runs away from hard work and tough decisions. Like many white politicians, Nixon sees no win for himself in Ferguson. And there might not be a winning play in this situation, I admit.</p>
<p>But dealing with no-win games is the price of leadership. Real leaders don't run from tough situations,. They just do the right thing. They make decisions and execute them and let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p>Not Nixon, though. Instead, Nixon has tried to ameliorate all sides, particularly angry African-Americans. He's tried to quell anger with mere words, and those words have been vacillating, irresponsible, and weak.</p>
<p>Last week, for instance, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/20/missouri-gov-calls-for-vigorous-prosecution-ferguson-shooting-case/" target="_blank">Nixon all but declared Officer Darren Wilson guilty of murder</a>, demanding that St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch arrest the officer immediately.</p>
<p>As a former prosecutor, Nixon knows how the police shooting process operates. He knows that McCulloch will not violate that process simply to make Nixon look effective as an executive. By making an unrealistic demand, Nixon doesn't look tough of (assumed) police violence&mdash;he looks out of touch and frightened.</p>
<h3>The Leader's Job</h3>
<p>The leader's job is not to play into people's raw emotions. It's to do the right thing, even if doing so causes temporary pain for the leader.</p>
<p>A real leader must be sensitive to those emotions without letting others' emotions guide his actions. <a title="How To Create Hate and Discontent in America" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/17/create-hate-discontent-america/" target="_blank">A leader reminds people of what is known and what is unknown</a>. The governor, of all people, should point out that justice goes both ways. Like all police-involved shootings, St. Louis County must conduct a thorough and impartial investigation of the incident and prosecute if warranted. And the offer involved must be presumed innocent until the process completes.</p>
<p>It's understandable that Michael Brown's family "knows" the officer was wrong. Their son is dead. They're in pain.</p>
<p>It's also understandable that Darren Wilson's family "knows" he did nothing wrong. I'd worry about them if they didn't.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is the absolutely, unquestioning certainty so many people espouse on Facebook and Twitter. No one knows exactly what happened. No one. Witnesses, including the officer, have not testified under oath. No coroner's autopsy has been released. Witness statements have not been formally aligned to physical evidence.</p>
<p>With so much unknown and so little known, statements like Nixon's only make a bad situation worse. At some point, this case will be final and half the people talking about it will be wrong. They will never admit being wrong, though. If the officer is not indicted or he's acquitted, Nixon and the "hang 'em high" crowd will say poor black men can't get justice in America.</p>
<p>What Missouri and America need are leaders who do what's right without regard for their political futures. Jay Nixon doesn't even come close to that standard.</p>
<p>If anything "good" comes from this tragedy, Nixon's political collapse might be at the top of that list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
