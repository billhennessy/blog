<p>I just caught a story on The Blaze about what you're doing in Ferguson, MO. Congratulations for taking real steps to put a face to the "tea party". Too many people believe only what they're told. </p>
<p>You've done a good thing here.</p>
<p>(I live north of you, way up in Hancock County, Illinois - a little north of Quincy, Illinois.)</p>
<p>I wish you the best.</p>
<p>God Bless you!</p>
<p>Best,</p>
