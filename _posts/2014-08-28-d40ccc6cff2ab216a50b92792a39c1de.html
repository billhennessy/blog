<p>Dear Mr Hennessy</p>
<p>I am an Independent and claim no political party although I always vote.  I had to write and tell you that I think the "Shop Ferguson" idea is excellent and I applaud you for that.  Just wanted you to know that my husband and I emailed our  State Rep.  Tim Jones in support of the Tea Party's suggestion for a Tax Holiday for Ferguson.  </p>
<p>I may not agree with everything you say, but you are thoughtful, make some good points, and present a civil, reasoned argument.  The same things I liked about John Danforth.  So you may not have a convert to the Tea Party, but you have a new reader.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Marie Vogler<br />
