  content: "I support that this needs to be revisited and discussed.  I grew up in
    St. Louis County, and while I live in JeffCo now, I still have a vested interest
    in my home town (as well as my current one :-) ).  \r\nI cannot attend - single
    mom of 3 schoolagers, and looking for employment while working on a paralegal
    degree (emphasis on Constitutional Law!) - but would like to keep abreast of what
    comes of this meeting.  I hope enough are able to come to make this a healthy
    discussion from varied perspectives."

<p style="color: #555555;">Hi. Bill Hennessy here. If you can, please stop by 111 Clarkson Executive Park, Ellisville, MO 63011 on Tuesday, September 2 at 7 p.m. (<a style="color: #428bca;" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/633186240135605/?context=create&amp;source=49" target="_blank">RSVP Here</a>&nbsp;if you'd like.)</p>
<p style="color: #555555;">I have something I'd like to talk to you about. It's about the tea party movement. But it's really about understanding two very important concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Living to our purpose.</li>
<li>Doing what's important.</li>
</ol>
<p style="color: #555555;">This is not&nbsp;a training session. It's not an After Party. It's not a rally. It's an honest conversation with a call to action.</p>
<p style="color: #555555;">It's about the things that made St. Louis Tea Party the most effective and most talked about tea party in the country in 2009 and 2010, where and why we strayed from our original purpose, and what I am going to do to get back to that original purpose.</p>
<p style="color: #555555;">I don't know if this new mission will be an official St. Louis Tea Party Coalition project or not. That's one of the reasons for this conversation.</p>
<p style="color: #555555;">I want you, the people who've stood with me through all my many failings, to hear the mission I'm going on. I hope you'll join me, but I understand if you do not.</p>
