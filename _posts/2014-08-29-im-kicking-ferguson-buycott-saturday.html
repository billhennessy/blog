  content: I was in Ferguson today and went to burgers and more and go a $10 diet
    coke but I was very glad to pay that amount for it. I then went to 911 salon and
    told her I would be back.  She still had no product in her inventory for me to
    buy. But both proprietors were happy I came to show my support. It left me feeling
    so glad I went down there.  I drove from Springfield IL to support them and I
    will be back.

<p>This Ferguson BUYcott is getting massive national attention. Big thanks to everyone who took part last week and who's joining in this week.</p>
<p>IN the past three days, I've seen four different people tear up when <a title="Why St. Louis Tea Party Went to Ferguson To Shop" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/21/why-st-louis-tea-party-went-to-ferguson-to-shop/" target="_blank">I told them what we did.</a></p>
<p>When Jack Buck died, I heard a dozen people say about him, "he did great acts of kindness for people who couldn't do a thing for him." That life lesson from one of my heroes stuck with me. But I never really knew how to live it. I was under the delusion that helping people who can't help you only works for famous people. Just about everybody can do less for the famous than the famous can do for them.</p>
<p>But this Ferguson BUYcott showed me how I CAN help people who probably can't return the favor anytime soon.</p>
<p>When you shop or dine in Ferguson, you're helping the entire community. But what feels good is helping the person right in front of you.</p>
<p>1:00 Saturday at 9193 W. Florissant Ave. That's where I'll be. Hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Please shop in groups of 6 or fewer. Don't be afraid to say you're with St. Louis Tea Party and you're there to shop. Don't buy the last of an item, because someone in the neighborhood might need it.</p>
<p>And smile.<a title="BUYcott Ferguson **UPDATE** DETAILS ** MORE UPDATES" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/18/buycott-ferguson/"> A smile can save a life</a>.</p>
