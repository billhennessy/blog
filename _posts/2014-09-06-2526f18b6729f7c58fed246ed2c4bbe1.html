<p>Can you really only use lawyers or paralegals?  I had to check yes to even submit form, so sorry for the lie. </p>
<p>I have no legal education, but can learn. I have an accounting degree, but doubt that would be useful.<br />
I encountered an equally frustrating maze of regulations/laws/government bureaucracy while being a caregiver of my mother with the medicare/insurance regulations.   </p>
<p>Ever since this came to the forefront, I've felt the need to do something to help, so if there's anyway I can help, please let me know.. I can file, type, make phone calls etc.  I do not work outside the home, so I am available during the day.</p>
<p>I am in the process of moving and fixing a house to sell, so less hours available now, but will be wiling to give more hours when that is done.<br />
