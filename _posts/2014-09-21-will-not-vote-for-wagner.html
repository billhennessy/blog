  content: Bill, you write,"While Mrs. Wagner is reliably pro-life and an ardent defender
    of the 2nd Amendment," Ardent defender of the 2nd Amendment; I don't know about
    that.She and Blaine Luetkemeyer recently voted on an amendment drafted by a Democrap
    restricting people's gun rights with PTSD or mental illness, and possibly people
    on anti-depressants in a knee jerk reaction to the killer in California by knifing,
    shooting and using his car as a weapon against his victims.

    won her 9th term, after the most significant primary challenge she'd ever had,
    and then 2 months later resigned to take a job with the National Rural Electrification

    the new job may, or may not, allow her to siphon the wealth of her former constituents
    away."

    Greg,

    I understand your concern, and you raise a good point. I believe Wagner and Leutkemeyer violated their consciences at the behest of the chamber of commerce. More evidence that money is her principle, not Self-Governance.

  content: It makes me sick when these politician claim one thing to get elected and
    do the opposite when they get to DC. No matter what you thought of Akin he was
    responsive to his district. He was a conservative. Wagner is a liberal big government
    politician. My husband and I are disgusted with Wagner! We will be voting for
    Slantz. Hopefully 2016 a conservative will run so we will at least have a choice.  Republicans
    should be riding a wave in this election. Not going to happen. Republicans Stand
    for nothing. They are simply the democrat-lite party. There will be zero push
    back to Obama even if they take the senate. Sad we only have a handful of patriots
    in DC to represent the people!

  content: "The following is the article about their votes. \r\n\r\nhttp://nagr.org/2014/2014/House/Betrayed-Lp.png\r\nby
    Dana Criswell, Federal Laws, Laws &amp; Legislation, New Stories\r\nHouse Republicans
    Vote to Deny Second Amendment Rights to Millions\r\nJune 4, 2014 11:05 am&middot;27
    comments\r\n\r\nHouse-of-Representatives-Chambers-In-US-CapitolBY DANA CRISWELL
    &ndash; June 4, 2014\r\n\r\nLast week while the NRA was spending their time and
    our money supporting Thad Cochran and denigrating those of us who supported Chis
    McDaniel, many Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives were busy passing
    more gun-control legislation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dudley Brown of the National
    Association of Gun Rights one in three Republicans decided to vote against your
    rights by supporting Barack Obama&rsquo;s agenda to label millions of American&rsquo;s
    &ldquo;mentally ill&rdquo;.  The Obama administration has been successful in denying
    more over 175,000 of our nations veterans their Second Amendment rights in this
    manner and are attempting to expand this to every American.\r\n\r\nThe amendment
    provids $20 million additional dollars for the federal government to acquire as
    many private medical records as possible and dump them into a national database.
    \ Once these records are obtained millions of citizens will be labeled mentally
    ill and denied their right to possess a firearm.\r\n\r\nThe mental illness threat
    is largely made up by those seeking to limit our rights and destroy the Second
    Amendment. In research published by The American Journal of Psychiatry, VOL. 163,
    No. 8, Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum found through his research that only 5% of those
    convicted of violent crimes were people who suffered from a mental disorder.\r\n\r\nFollowing
    his research, Dr. Appelbaum came to two conclusions, First, the proportion of
    violence that they (people with mental disorders) account for is relatively small,
    suggesting that the well-documented public perception of the mentally ill as dangerous
    persons is substantially exaggerated. Secondly, that the disproportionate attention
    given to their acts of violence by the media and by our elected representatives
    is unwarranted.\r\n\r\nThe assault on our rights and the Second Amendment comes
    from many directions.   The Republicans who followed the lead of the Democrats
    and voted for this amendment are either allies with Obama in his attempt to destroy
    our rights or simply not smart enough to understand the real issue.  Either way,
    they need to be sent home.\r\n\r\nHere is the list provided by the National Association

  content: "The following is another article that explains it better. House of Representatives
    passes Bill, enables restriction of 2nd Amendment right\r\nBY MICHAEL VASS | MAY
    31, 2014\r\nWithout fanfare, and well below the radar of almost everyone, the
    House of Representatives has just enabled New York State (and any other State
    contributing to the NICS database) to violate HIPAA laws and revoke gun permits
    without justification or cause. It sounds too crazy to be true, and most would
    think that defenders of the 2nd Amendment would prevent such a violation of rights
    to occur, but that is not the case.\r\n2nd Amendment\r\nWe first learned of this
    from Gun Owners of America. In a post on their website they highlight HR 4660
    and specifically H Amd 704. It is the Amendment that is critical to gun owners
    across the nation and especially in New York State. H Amd 704 will provide $19.5
    million to States to update the National Instant Criminal Background Check system.\r\nLet&rsquo;s
    pause for a few details.\r\nHR 4660 is a boring and relatively bland appropriations
    Bill that will fund various agencies of the Government. It was passed 5/30/14,
    in a vote of 321-87 (NY-22 Rep. Richard Hanna voted to pass this Bill). This Bill,
    like most, contained Amendments to it &ndash; in this case 84 of them.\r\nH Amd
    704 authorized spending $19.5 million to encourage States to voluntarily add names
    of citizens to the National Instant Criminal Background Check system (NICS).\r\nWhat
    is NICS?\r\nNICS is a database that is used at the point of sale of a firearm.
    Anyone on this list will be denied the ability to own a firearm. In addition,
    those on the database with a firearms permit can have that permit revoked and
    the firearm confiscated. The list is meant for those:\r\nConvicted or under indictment
    of a crime punishable by 1 year imprisonment\r\nA fugitive\r\nHas been adjudicated
    as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution\r\nIs subject to a
    court order that restrains the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening
    an intimate partner or child of such intimate partner\r\nThere are other conditions
    that could cause a person to be added to this list, but for the purpose of this
    article we will stop here. The 3rd item is the one that matter to those in NYS,
    as per the NY Safe Act. According to Jim Tresmond of Tresmond Law Firm, on the
    Tom Bauerle Show &ndash; WBEN 930AM, citizens are having their firearm permits
    revoked,\r\n&ldquo;That is a fact. We are representing a client right now, who
    is been impacted by this onerous activity of the Government.&rdquo; &ndash; Jim
    Tresmond\r\nHow is this happening?\r\nApparently, New York State is searching
    medical records of firearm permit holders &ndash; in violation of Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the 4th Amendment &ndash;
    without cause, and isolating those receiving psychiatric care and (at least) anti-anxiety
    medication. These individuals, a full tally of which is currently unknown, are
    thus having their firearm license revoked and firearms confiscated. All without
    any incident, violation of law, or other factor involved. All under the power
    of the NY Safe Act.\r\nSo what does this have to do with HR 4460 and H Amd 704?
    This is how it all ties together.\r\nSince 2007, Congress has paid States that
    voluntarily add people to the NICS database. The reasoning is, as sponsor Rep.
    Mike Thompson (D-CA) states,\r\n&ldquo;Our states need more resources to get all
    their information into the NICS system,&rdquo; Thompson said. &ldquo;If we give
    them these resources, we can stop dangerous people from getting guns. And we can
    save lives.&rdquo;\r\nIt should be noted that the NICS has never been proven to
    have prevented a single mass shooting ever. There is large debate if the database
    can ever prevent a mass shooting, no matter how many are placed upon it. Which
    says nothing of the debate about the impact the NICS has on criminal possession
    and use of firearms.\r\nBut, back to the point at hand. The NICS database has
    been limited by the need for funding, which H Amd 704 will increase. New York
    State is using the NICS, and the NY Safe Act, to revoke licenses and restrict
    the 2nd Amendment rights of Americans, without cause and in violation of HIPAA
    law. NYS will now be able to increase the number of people that it will violate
    the rights of if HR 4660 becomes law &ndash; which is likely.\r\nAs for the defenders
    of the 2nd Amendment? Like say the NRA or members of Congress like Rep. Richard
    Hanna, who has proudly promoted his NRA rating in his bid to be re-elected?\r\nWell
    in regard to the NRA and H Amd 704, the NRA had no position as of 5/29/14.\r\nRep.
    Richard Hanna\r\nRep. Richard Hanna and 13 Republicans, as well as 11 Democrats,
    had no position either way. They neither voted for nor against H Amd 704, and
    its potential to restrict the 2nd Amendment rights of Americans. 142 Republicans
    and 3 Democrats voted against the funding and imposition on the 2nd Amendment.
    Thus H Amd 704 passed and is part of HR 4660.\r\nThat left another chance for
    Rep. Richard Hanna, and other &ldquo;defenders&rdquo; of the 2nd Amendment to
    prevent States like New York from violating the rights of Americans. All they
    had to do is vote NAY on HR 4660. If nothing else it would serve to prove they
    are reading the Bills they are voting on. It would show they are standing by the
    very convictions some, like Rep. Hanna, are asking voters to re-elect them for.\r\nRep.
    Hanna and 203 Republicans, 117 Democrats as well, voted to pass HR 4660 &ndash;
    and H Amd 704 with it &ndash; on 5/30/14.\r\nSo to conclude, very quietly, the
    House of Representatives has just taken a step to enable New York State to increase
    the number of American citizens &ndash; without criminal actions or incidents
    &ndash; that it will restrict the 2nd Amendment rights of. Passage of HR 4660
    is likely in the Senate, and removal of H Amd 704 unlikely. Thus Congress is poised
    to help violate the rights of Americans across the nation potentially, and very
    realistically in New York State.\r\nDoes this sound like what you elected your
    member of Congress for? Is this the defending of the 2nd Amendment you were told
    about on the campaign trail? Does this reflect your views and that of your neighbors/co-workers/friends?\r\nYou
    can do nothing, now that you know. You could re-elect the various members of Congress
    that either didn&rsquo;t read the Bill or just don&rsquo;t think the public is
    smart enough to understand what is happening.\r\nOR, you can vote for an accountable
    and credible voice of the people in the primaries and mid-term elections this
    year. You can write a letter to your member of Congress, expressing that you are
    paying attention to what they are &ndash; or are not &ndash; doing in your name.
    You can join an organization of like minded people.\r\nYou can do any of the above,
    if you want. But if you do nothing, especially in New York, especially if Rep.
    Richard Hanna is your Congressman, then don&rsquo;t be surprised if tomorrow there
    is a knock at your door and the Government is there ready to take away your rights."

    represents Ann Wagner and her desire for more power.  In 2012 I did a right in

    has no reason to change how she votes unless she thinks she will lose the election.  Let's

    should the same thing happen in the 2nd.  As the law stands now, the governor
    would have to promptly schedule a special election, and the 2nd CD party committees
    would nominate the individuals who would go on that ballot--there would be no
    primary of the voters at large.\r\n\r\nThis is just another reason those elected
    GOP committee members are so important.  Chairs and vice chairs of all county
    and legislative (house) district party committees within the 2nd are the members
    of the 2nd CD party committees.  They are imbued with a lot of power, should a
    vacancy in the U.S. House district occur.  So think about who those people are.
    \ Since we have the example of the 8th CD, it's \"fool  me once, shame on you,
    fool me twice, shame on me.\"  Jason Smith had to get the majority of votes from
    86 people."

  content: As far as who benefits from government wealth redistribution both parties
    are but two sides of the same coin. Consider quantitative easing (aka worthless
    money creation run amuck). The primary beneficiaries of QE are the banks and super
    rich. Consider all the global warming scams that have funneled millions into corporate
    coffers by whichever party is in power. The evidence is plain that the current
    White House occupier is the most prolific spender to ever hold office. However,
    since 2011 every penny of that has been authorized either directly or with silent
    assent by the very legislative House which has the power of the purse and has
    a majority of R's. I am ahead of the curve somewhat here. I actually listened
    to Romney and Ryan and learned they were not as they claimed. For example, Romney
    came out in favor of a minimum wage indexed to inflation. Really? In 2012 I voted
    for the Constitution Party candidate. I have seen nothing since that election
    to give me any confidence that the United States Ship of State will be better
    piloted by an R than by a D. I will not vote for Wagner, I live in the 3rd. I
    will not vote for Blaine either. He just voted to fund, arm and train the allies
    of ISIS waging jihad against the Syrian government and to fund every dream from
    a Kenyan father's marxist imagination through December. i don't know when their
    party will ever comprehend that with the current regime, the USA is in a battle
    for its very existence - and we're losing. Conceding to the other side is not
    a winning strategy. I will vote for individual Republicans, absolutely no Democrats
    but I prefer Gary Johnson's neighbor's two dogs to Mickey Mouse. Nothing against
    Mickey but he's even older than I.

<h3>Ann Wagner Yanked&nbsp;Missouri's 2nd District to the Left</h3>
<p>The numbers are stunning.</p>
<p>Missouri's 2nd Congressional District is one of the most conservative in the state.&nbsp;The seat held by&nbsp;Jim Talent and Todd Akin has long aligned with&nbsp;Heritage Foundation's principled conservatism.</p>
<p>By replacing Todd Akin with Ann Wagner, 2nd District voters lurched the state hard to the left. How far left? Twenty-three percentage points left.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_15424" align="aligncenter" width="653"]<a href="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MO-2-Heritage-Scores.png"><img class=" wp-image-15424" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MO-2-Heritage-Scores.png" alt="Source: Heritage Action for America" width="653" height="396" /></a> Source: Heritage Action for America[/caption]</p>
<p>When the 112th Congress ended, Todd Akin sat at 82 percent on Heritage Action's Scorecard. Right now, Ann Wagner's score is 58. That's below the Republican House average, and it's miles beneath her district's philosophical center.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wagner's HA score would be respectable in certain districts in Maine, Michigan, or California. In Missouri's 2nd, they're disgraceful. I realize that Todd Akin was a liability for many reasons. But his consistent principled conservative voting wasn't one of them. We might not want Akin back, but I would sure like a US Representative who will catch the wave instead of going with the elitist flow.</p>
<h3>Export-Import Bank Was a Defining Issue</h3>
<p>While Mrs. Wagner is&nbsp;reliably pro-life and an ardent defender of the 2nd Amendment, her&nbsp;philosophy of government is anything but&nbsp;Hayekian. <a title="Here Are the Ex-Im Facts Ann Wagner and Claire McCaskill Don&rsquo;t Want You to Know" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/09/10/heres-ex-im-facts-ann-wagner-claire-mccaskill-wont-tell/">Mrs. Wagner announced loud and clear her loud support for Export-Import Bank</a>. I trust Mrs. Wagner to represent my views on several issues, most especially the paradoxical combination mentioned above: life and guns. I suppose she&nbsp;will agree with me&nbsp;on the First Amendment, as well. Beyond those three admittedly crucial issues, I suspect Mrs. Wagner represents the ruling class against the rest of us.</p>
<p>Export-Import Bank is particularly telling. First, because it is so small an issue, it would seem the easiest and least consequential for even a play-acting&nbsp;conservative to adopt the conservative line. The two companies that receive the lion's share of Ex-Im largesse--Boeing and GE--would survive just as well without it. Boeing has stated such. Second, because Ex-Im is such an unmistakable symbol of anti-freedom, supporting the bank defines the person.</p>
<h4>Ex-Im Bank Is Anti-Freedom</h4>
<p>Hayek defined freedom as "the state in which man is not subject to coercion by the arbitrary will of another or others." The Export-Import Bank exemplifies&nbsp;the condition opposite freedom: the state of currying favor of a bureaucrat. The bank chooses among competing companies those that will succeed and those that will fail. Companies wishing the advantage of this bureaucratic coercion grovel at the feet of government functionaries. Or give money to Congressmen. Companies that choose not to grovel put themselves in&nbsp;an economic disadvantage, sometimes ruining their business.</p>
<p>Grovelling before one's master is hardly an act of freedom. It's an act of slavery, and Ann Wagner wants to perpetuate that slavery.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Wagner and the US Chamber of Commerce like to point to specific companies that have thrived thanks to corporate welfare, they forget to mention those "successful" companies' competitors who "failed" because government made the playing field uneven.</p>
<p>Because Export-Import Bank represents an opportunity for politicians to clearly state their political philosophy, we must accept Mrs. Wagner's position as indicative of her philosophy. I now accept that Mrs. Wagner and I fundamentally disagree on what constitutes a just government. Fundamentally, not superficially. In other words,<strong> the kind of government Mrs. Wagner supports is the kind of government I want&nbsp;to erase.</strong></p>
<h3>Philosophy of Government Is an Organizing Principle of the Tea Party Movement</h3>
<p>The two establishment parties have no central, organizing principle regarding a philosophy of government. Parties exist solely to maximize their own power through elections. We discern their philosophy by their actions, not their platforms. The GOP's actions on Ex-Im and many other issues prove the party believes in government by a ruling elite.</p>
<p>It's one thing to vote for Ex-Im out of fear. It's another thing to publicly advance the idea that government should replace free markets. Mrs. Wagner is on the side of government and government-sanctioned corporations.</p>
<p>Because free markets is an organizing principle of a movement I had a hand in launching, I cannot vote for Ann Wagner until she demonstrates a free market bias.</p>
<h3>Ann Wagner and the GOP Elite Missed a Huge Opportunity with Ex-Im</h3>
<p>On a practical level, I'm a little shocked that Mrs. Wagner and the House Republican leadership passed this golden opportunity. That missed opportunity was best described by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-export-import-bank-20140920-story.html" target="_blank">Dan Holler of Heritage Action in an LA Times article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">"They had a chance to have a federal agency expire right before an election and go back home and campaign that they ended corporate welfare," he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">I thought Mrs. Wagner and the GOP elite were, at least, opportunistic. The Ex-Im sell-out tells me they're not. Instead, their winging it. With neither a philosophical core or a practical plan, Washington Republicans are simply selling out to the highest bidder. And that's usually the US Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, that gives me some hope. Ann Wagner would be very difficult to defeat in either a primary or a general election. But we might be able to change her behavior on issues like Ex-Im. To do that, we need leverage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We don't have Boeing's government-funded billions to throw around. We have our votes. If movement conservatives in the 2nd District vote Libertarian in November, or skip the US House vote altogether, we might be able to hold Wagner in the 50s. That would be a big step backwards from 2012 margin of 60-37.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A step back will put Wagner in a tough position for 2016. Democrats will be encouraged to take the race more seriously. Libertarians could also target the district. Wagner's only choice would be to move to the right to solidify her base.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In other words, the only way to save Ann Wagner might be to vote against her this November.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">My First non-Republican Vote for Congress. Ever.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I<a title="Here Are the Ex-Im Facts Ann Wagner and Claire McCaskill Don&rsquo;t Want You to Know" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/09/10/heres-ex-im-facts-ann-wagner-claire-mccaskill-wont-tell/">n my post last week, I offered Mrs. Wagner the opportunity to reply</a>. She has not. Therefore, we have to assume Mrs. Wagner agrees with my assertions, accepts my facts, and feels so strongly in her (non-)philosophy of government that she simply has moved on. Fine. That's her prerogative.</p>
<p>I have a prerogative, too. And I choose to exercise my prerogative by stating that<strong> I will not vote for Mrs. Wagner's re-election</strong> in 2014. I cannot vote for a person whose philosophy of government I find morally reprehensible and unjust.</p>
<p>I won't vote for the Democrat in the race for precisely the same reason.</p>
<p>That leaves me two choices: skip that race on my ballot, or vote for Bill Slantz, the Libertarian Party candidate. I'll work on that decision and let you know how it comes out, but, one way or the other, I'm swimming out to catch the wave.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I hope you will consider whether you can vote for a member of Congress&nbsp;who advances a philosophy&nbsp;of government that, in 1776, we utterly and formally rejected.</p>
