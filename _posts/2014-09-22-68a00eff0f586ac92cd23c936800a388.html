<p>Hi Bill, my name is Paul Steiner I am the son of Boaz Steiner the Israeli who comes to your meetings sometimes. Anyway I am attending college at WildWood Community College and I want to make a tea party/conservative group at my school and also get more involved in politics in general. I didn't know if you knew of any way to not only start a group at my school but to also get involved in my community. If you have any advice I would be greatly appreciative. Thank you, Paul Steiner.<br />
