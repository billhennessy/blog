  content: "Interesting logic Bill, I like to think that since Rick states he is against
    the corruption in St Louis. That we have a chance to show up in the County Council
    chambers after he is elected with carefully crafted points and encourage him to
    push the policy.\r\n\r\nWhereas Stanger would be more political machine which
    got St Louis and St Louis city into the mess we are in.\r\n\r\nI want to see less
    taxes, less regulation, less government intrusion, MORE government accountability
    (North County municipalities never saw a law they felt compelled to follow, which
    is the definition of corruption). Rick has the ability and stated desire to stop
    this corruption which will bring back jobs and a middle class to St Louis....
    Lets Leverage Rick instead of dismissing him!"

  content: "I agree 100% with your logic and will vote for Bill Slantz and Rick Stream
    for the reasons you listed.  \r\n\r\nBut I doubt anything will move Ann Wagner
    further to the right.  She is too corrupt and doesn't care what her constituents
    think.  She knows she can't lose in the second district because she has all the
    money and all the big names behind her."

  content: "Bill,\r\n\r\nI am having trouble wrapping my mind around how we \"improve
    liberty\" by supporting an individual who:\r\n\r\na)  as chairman of the house
    budget committee in the MO legislature voted to put the largest tax increase in
    the history of the state on the ballot as a constitutional amendment, and \r\n\r\nb)
    took a campaign contribution from an out-of-state company that sells redlight
    cameras then cast a vote in the legislature for a bill designed to enable the
    use of redlight cameras across the state.\r\n\r\nDo we consider taking more money
    from the people to put it in the hands of a few construction companies and local
    government fifedoms (for \"green\" bike paths) that stand to benefit an \"increase
    of liberty\" or \"crony capitalism\"?  Are the redlight cameras, i.e. \"stationary
    drones\", the government and Streams donors want to put throughout our communities
    state-wide making us more safe or creating an ability for the government to perform
    a warrantless search into our cars every time we cross an intersection?\r\n\r\nAs
    far as maximizing your/our political power - I get the feeling that Stream and
    those in his camp view those of us like you and myself as simple political rubes
    who can be manipulated to \"join forces with them to defeat those evil Democrats\"
    once we have been put in our place after they pull out all stops to defeat our
    candidates during the primary  (where was their call for \"unity\" when Tony Pousosa
    was the only candidate up until the last day for filing?).  I'll predict this
    here today - IF Stream is elected, he will a) listen to you/us, then b) ignore
    you/us.  How can we expect to gain \"political power\" by becoming a band of clapping
    seals for the crony capitalists of the Republican establishment from the tables
    they reserve for us in back of the room once they have \"crushed\" our liberty/small
    government movement (Mitch McConnell's words, not mine)? \r\n\r\n\r\nDon't get
    me wrong - I'm not endorsing Stenger either, I really don't see much difference
    between the two and am pretty much agnostic about this race either way.  If it's
    real political power you want in St. Louis County, rather than merely \"access\",
    I suggest ignoring the clamour for Stream and focusing your energies like a laser
    on helping elect Jennifer Bird to the county council.  She will be our only real
    voice of liberty on the council and will hold whomever we elect - be it Stream
    or Stenger - publicly accountable for their behavior.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing
    something and just don't  get it.  Please explain in more detail here how you
    expect this to really work.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJim"

<p>Maybe this logic sucks, but this is my logic.&nbsp; When I vote, I ignore my positions on issues.&nbsp; Instead, I use my vote to advance two objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want my vote to improve policy towards liberty.</li>
<li>I want my vote to maximize my political power.</li>
</ol>
<p>A simple test that I ask myself is this: If I vote for A, do I expect resulting policy to be more or less to my liking?&nbsp; And how should I vote to maximize my power?</p>
<p>Let's see how this logic plays out in two races: my Congressional District and St. Louis County Executive.</p>
<h3>Missouri&rsquo;s 2nd Congressional District Race</h3>
<p>If I vote for Wagner, I expect policy to be less to my liking.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because I think Ann Wagner will win her 2014 re-elect no matter how I vote.&nbsp; Therefore, a vote for her will be lost in the sea of votes.&nbsp; Historically, Wagner should get between 60 percent and 65 percent of the vote.&nbsp; There will be about 282,000 votes cast in her race, so my vote would count for 1 in 176,250.</p>
<p>If I vote against Wagner, I expect she&rsquo;ll still win, but I might be able eat into her margin.&nbsp; If that happens, her power and influence in both Missouri and Washington wane.&nbsp; More of her considerable campaign funds will go to her own re-elections, which means she&rsquo;ll have less money to buy influence from other Republicans.</p>
<p>To counter that loss of influence, Wagner has a choice: she can move left and hope to pick up support from Democrat voters or she can move right to regain support from liberty voters.</p>
<p>I expect she will do the latter.</p>
<p>Therefore, by voting against Wagner in 2014, I think I will increase my influence, and policy over the next two years will be more to my liking.</p>
<h3>St. Louis County Executive Race</h3>
<p>Different dynamics prevail in the St. Louis County Executive race. Rick Stream is likely to lose if I, and people like me, vote against him.&nbsp; Further, I believe that there is a 100 percent chance that either Rick Stream or Steve Stenger will win. So, if Stream loses, Stenger wins. Therefore, I expect St. Louis County policy to be more to my liking if I vote for Rick Stream and less to my liking if I vote for anyone else. Which is why I&rsquo;m voting for Rick Stream.</p>
<p>You can argue with my logic, but it&rsquo;s internally consistent.&nbsp; I can, in good conscious, vote for Bill Slantz for Congress and for Rick Stream for County Executive.&nbsp; I believe that this combination of votes maximizes my influence, and will improve policy in Congress and St. Louis County.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m optimizing my power in 2014.</p>
