    time. And nothing is more important than spending time with your family.

<p>I am scaling back my&nbsp;blogging.</p>
<p>I spend about 1-2 hours on most posts. That's writing, researching, photo editing, etc. It's time consuming. It's also worth the effort.</p>
<p>Blogging is an opportunity cost, too. Every hour I spend blogging is an hour I'm not doing anything else. The things I'm not doing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>admiring my wife</li>
<li>talking to my kids</li>
<li>catching up with friends</li>
<li>advancing my career</li>
<li>cleaning up my office</li>
<li>changing my underwear</li>
<li>cheering on the Blues (or Cardinals or Rams)</li>
<li>working out</li>
<li>washing my car</li>
<li>fixing that door that doesn't open right</li>
<li>training my dogs to&nbsp;make a proper CC and club soda</li>
<li>paying bills</li>
<li>answering emails</li>
<li>blowing the leaves out of the garage</li>
<li>hunting copperheads and rattlesnakes (we have both out here)</li>
<li>visiting my parents</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, I'm scaling back some other political activity to focus on two important issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Municipal courts</li>
<li>Grassroots strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll still post blogs. Maybe more than I have been. But the posts will be short, personal, and even more opinionated than they have been.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'll return to the long form blog in future. After 5 years of this activism, though, I need to bother some other people in my life.</p>
<p>In the meantime, keep the faith. Own your own life. And work for your interests, not your positions.</p>
