<p>Good Morning Bill.<br />
My name is Joel Frewa, I am the communications director for TheTeaParty.net. My boss and civil rights leader Niger Innis asked me to reach out to you because we are launching a huge voter education effort called Restore The Dream. </p>
<p>We are kicking this off on the 20th of october here in DC and then moving to North Carolina, but we would like to make a stop in Ferguson, MO, in order to show that the Tea Party truly is the new civil rights movement. We are trying to change the democrat's victimization narrative. </p>
<p>Joining us in this project is Alveda King, and other civil rights leaders. You can see the complete list at RestoreTheDream2014.com. </p>
<p>Long story short, we'd like to his a tea party rally in ferguson, in cooperation with you, and maybe have Niger and Alveda speak at some churches, and other community gatherings.<br />
We would like to do this on the weekend of the 25th and 26th of october.</p>
<p>Please contact me so we can touch base, and see how we can collaborate. All of my information is below.<br />
Thank you for your time Bill, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
