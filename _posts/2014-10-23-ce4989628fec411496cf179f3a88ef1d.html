<p>Bill,<br />
I live in Florissant but frequent Ferguson businesses regularly. I really appreciated your Buycott a few weeks back.</p>
<p>Al Sharpton is planning a 4 day rally in Ferguson Oct. 31-Nov. 3. ( not again!!!!)</p>
<p>I am wondering if you would organize another Buycott in the days BEFORE that, along New Florissant Road ( not West Florissant Rd.) One locally owned Italian restaurant, Vincenzo's,  is right next to the Ferguson Police Station. (It is owned by Mr. Lonero who has been a wonderful entrepreneur , investing in several businesses in Ferguson.) I don't think they are getting much business these days, with the nightly protests.  There are lots of small business owners and restaurants along South Florissant right near the Ferguson Police Station.</p>
<p>If you have time, you could take 270 and go south on New Florissant Road ( 2 miles), and see what businesses are there. Off the top of my head, I can think of a Walgreens, Shop and Save,  the Whistlestop ( our favorite frozen custard stand in a quaint old train station- that got torched a few weeks  ago, but is open), several Chinese restaurants, Aldi's ( has been closing early), hardware store, Andy Wurm tires, locally owned bakeries, beauty shop, Mexican restaurant, Quizno's, Faraci's pizza, etc. There are more, but those are near the police station.</p>
<p>The Ferguson Saturday Farmer's Market has been closed down several times.</p>
<p>There is a large parking lot  at Aldi's where folks could park and walk 1-2 blocks to many of these businesses. These other small businesses do not have large parking lots.</p>
<p>Thanks for all you do, and hope to hear from you!</p>
