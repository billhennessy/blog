<p>The White House and its corrupt Department of Justice has one chance to change the election's outcome.<img class="alignright wp-image-14949 size-medium" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Obama-Smug-300x200.jpg" alt="Obama Smug" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>According to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/senate-forecast/" target="_blank">the GOP has a 62.1 percent chance of a Senate majority</a>. With nine days left until the election, and&nbsp;with President Obama's approval and likability plunging, the Democrats face a huge loss.</p>
<h3>Apathetic Democrats</h3>
<p>Many political observers blame Democrat voter apathy, particularly among African-Americans. The black vote that swelled in 2008 and 2012 with Obama on the ballot shows signs of deflating in 2014 as it did in 2010.</p>
<p>Barack Obama can't campaign for anyone. When he showed up to support long-time friend Anthony Brown in Maryland last week, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2799603/crowds-walk-obama-speech-rare-campaign-trail-appearance.html" target="_blank">the crowd left</a>. Even dedicated Democrats are sick of his shtick.</p>
<p>But this is the most corrupt White House since Nixon. It's unlikely Obama will let the Senate fall without firing all his ammo. And the only arrow left in the Democrat's quiver could land in the heart of St. Louis County.</p>
<h3>Race and Sex Division Is All They Have</h3>
<p>The Democrats rely on race-baiting and sex-baiting. With polls showing women favoring Republicans this year, the sex arrow is broken. That leaves race.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has been leaking evidence from its investigation into Michael Brown's shooting for a week. It even released the official autopsy to the New York Times. There must be a reason. And that reason could be the election.</p>
<p>In Obama's cynical mind, he might decide the best chance to energize African American voters is to announce that the Justice Department will not prosecute Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown. The White House would then let career race-hustlers like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton blame <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/crime-law/police-using-deadly-force-are-rarely-convicted/ng8Nf/" target="_blank">the Supreme Court's past rulings on deadly force</a> by police officers..</p>
<h3>Voter&nbsp;Intimidation</h3>
<p>If the DOJ releases such a statement, look for groups like the New Black Panther Party to descend on key states with close Senate races. They'll try to use intimidation to drive down turnout while&nbsp;the Democrats' vaunted election-stealing machine fires up to manufacture a margin of victory for their side.</p>
<p>Is this a cynical view? Yes. But not nearly as cynical as the Obama White House.</p>
