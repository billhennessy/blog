<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>I recently emailed the St. Louis Tea Party main email, but I wanted to reach out to you directly. I'm Emily Ekins, and I'm a doctoral candidate at UCLA writing my dissertation on the tea party movement. (You may be familiar with some of my research, highlighted here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101303634.html).  </p>
<p>I've found that little academic research on the movement has included actual interviews with tea party activists. I'm reaching out to activists and tea party leaders like yourself to hear in your own words what the movement is about and what brought you to the movement. I'm particularly interested in the early tea party movement, and I understand you were one of the movement's trailblazers.</p>
<p>Would you be available for a phone interview next week to discuss your thoughts on the tea party movement?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
