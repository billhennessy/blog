  content: Thanks Bill.  You put into words exactly what I was thinking.  Obama's
    amnesty plan is his personal vendetta against the American people.  He is saying
    "you rejected me so I will reject you."

  content: When will Congress stop writing into laws provisions for Executive Department
    discretion?  Most "lawful authority" a President has to rule by Executive Order
    has been given to him by Congress through those provisions written into laws.

    and libertarians accept that ideological purity is a continuous measure, not a
    discreet condition

  content: "Ok - let me get this straight.   What we now have is vulnerable 2016 Dems
    (like Claire) running around \"acting\" as though they disapprove, wringing their
    hands saying that he should have waited on the new congress to come up with bipartisan
    immigration reform - now trying to distance themselves from Obama, while \"acting\"
    all CONSTITUTIONAL.  The EO will go away when Obama goes away and then we will
    get to watch Mitch McConnell, OLD GUARD Republicans and the suddenly CONSTITUTION
    LOVING DEMS  (that were for it before they were against it and are worried about
    the 2016 election) actually turn it into LAW in 2015.  Hate to be such a \"downer\"
    but as long as we are putting our faith (I put it in God) in elections, we need
    to change tactics.  We need to try to stack the deck by recruiting Constitutional
    candidates on all THREE tickets or find some really good Libertarian candidates
    and some REALLY DEEP POCKETS that feel the two party system is failing us .  If
    the willfully ignorant Dems would have had their own Tea Party and cleaned house
    \ we would be in a much better spot.  \r\n\r\nI've often wondered what would happen
    if politicians like Mike Lee or Ted Cruz would switch to the Libertarian ticket
    . . . Might get very interesting."

  content: I think if CRUZ  or Carson would run on Constitutional ticket we might
    have a chance to win. I feel we have no chance of conservative win if they run
    on Republican ballot. Hello Bush, Christy Romney etc..

<p>Let's be honest with ourselves: President Obama's unilateral, dictatorial action on immigration is not to benefit illegals. It's to punish American voters for rejecting him.</p>
<p>This is personal.</p>
<p>In two years, the next American president will let this and many other Obama executive orders expire. Executive orders are not law. They expire with the term of the president who signed them. No future president is bound to renew them. And the next president won't.</p>
<p>So life for the illegals will get worse. Instead of wrongfully believe they've been denied something, they'll correctly feel they've lost something. They'll feel vulnerable and abandoned. All because Obama needed to "get even" with the American people.</p>
<p>Increasingly, Obama's actions are not just wrong; they're evil.</p>
