<p><em>Updated: the original title said "Congress is for sale."  My mistake. I meant Government. </em></p>
<p>Once upon a time in America, people built companies by filling society's unmet needs. To survive, a company relied on innovation, quality, and, of course, good advertising. The best advertisement being word of mouth.</p>

<p>The way to grow a successful company is to get government to protect your market, dampen competition, and require people to buy what you sell.</p>
<p>Here's who's paying for the privilege of thwarting competition.</p>

<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce bought the Export Import Bank. And amnesty.</p>
<p>The insurance companies,  along with the hospital corporation, helped write Obamacare.</p>
<p>Why does Google know more about you than your spouse? Because Google pays government to let them.</p>
<p>This is government. Want to change it?</p>
