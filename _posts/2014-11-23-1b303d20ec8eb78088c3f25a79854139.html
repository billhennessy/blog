<p>Hey Bill,  I contacted John Hancock back in the spring to see if he might help with my State Senate District 24 race.  He said he had already been hired by Jay Ashcroft. </p>
<p>I remember searching Jay's MEC filings for Hancock, because I was curious how much Hancock charged.  I never did recognize Hancock on Jay's list of expenses.  </p>
<p>But if Jay did follow his advice -- even though the race was inherently stacked against a Republican candidate -- I'm curious what Ashcroft's defeat says about John Hackcock's effectiveness?<br />
