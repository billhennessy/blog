<p>The billionaire with the great big blimp buys another politician.</p>
<p>After a raising a measely $66k in campaign contributions, Catherine Hanaway sold her soul&nbsp;to wierd billionaire&nbsp;<a href="http://politicmo.com/2014/10/15/rex-sinquefield-goes-all-in-for-catherine-hanaway-for-governor/" target="_blank">Rex Sinquefield. The price? $750,000 down</a>&nbsp;plus $10,000 a week through the election.</p>
<p><strong>With Rex, nothing is ever what it appears.</strong></p>
<p>You might know that<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2012/09/30/ignoramus-rex/" target="_blank"> Rex is tight with Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat</a>. You might also know that Koster is planning to run for governor himself. Or, at least, he was. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F10%2F29%2Fus%2Flobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html&amp;ei=VEBtVPj8NYOsyATJ_oH4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7pK5EXmOcSmN5dE7Jij4PM_ICRQ&amp;sig2=rVQUPMTvvZmCNjfYJ4o4CA&amp;bvm=bv.80120444,d.aWw" target="_blank">The New York Times story about Koster pimping&nbsp;out the AG's office</a> might have changed his mind. And if Senator Claire McCaskill decides to run for governor, Koster will take some other primary-free race like a good Democrat. In the meantime, Koster is the lone&nbsp;Democrat seeking the office of governor after Jay Nixon stops mishandling the buck.</p>
<p>So, has&nbsp;Rex abandoned his old friend Koster? Hardly. In fact, from where I sit, <strong>Rex is using Hanaway to clear the field for Koster.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hanaway is a sloppy&nbsp;candidate</strong>. She's about as inspiring a speaker as Ben Stein in <em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em>. She fought against concealed carry in Missouri, even blocking a bill as Speaker of the House in 1998, earning an NRA rating of D. That's D, as in dill weed. (Hanaway reluctantly voted for a concealed carry bill in 1999 because she could no longer muster support to suppress the bill.)</p>
<p><strong>If Catherine Hanaway is the Republican candidate, Koster will stroll into the governor's mansion</strong> without a fight. And Rex knows it.</p>
<p>Rex's $1 million payout to Hanaway&nbsp;looks like a bid to discourage more viable Republicans from running.</p>
<p>If I'm right, Catherine Hanaway ain't getting a ring and a date from Rex. She's getting used. She'll cash in, and that's it. It's a transaction. She's a pawn. Catherine Hanaway will&nbsp;be tossed aside like yesterday's paper once the field is cleared.</p>
<p>That's how Rex plays chess.</p>
