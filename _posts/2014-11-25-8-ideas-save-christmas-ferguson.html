  content: Our family is willing to adopt a family from Ferguson for Christmas. A
    family that lost their job due to their place of employment being burned to the
    ground or looted. Send names, sex and sizes and their wish list. They deserve
    a bright Christmas.

  content: "I found your blog through bizpac review. I'm glad to see Tea Partiers
    stepping up to help people out. I can't tell you how awesome that is to me watching
    from NW Arkansas. \r\n\r\nI'd like to give you a few pieces of marketing advice.
    You don't know me, but the advice is free. Take it or leave it. \r\n\r\n1) Focus
    the writing on your Tea Party page on the subject of helping the area. It'll help
    the community, build your support base, and turn the image of your movement around
    locally. God knows the Tea Party gets almost no positive press. \r\n\r\n2) Write
    MORE on the Tea Party page about what the group is doing to help the local community
    - specifically on the ground action, and less about specific political issues.
    Bring. People. Together. Grab this situation and make it the party's mission.
    \r\n\r\n3) When you organize your next gathering or \"BUYcott,\" get someone to
    write up a press release and MAKE SURE there's a link to the Tea Party page as
    well as the event in that release. It took me forever to find all the details
    on what you're working on. Make those details priority. \r\n\r\nMaybe make a map
    on the site, and get out the word through facebook. There are a LOT of great tools
    for promoting on facebook. I've used them to build up my side business online,
    and I've been rather successful at it. \r\n\r\nRegardless, good luck."

  content: I am not in the position to adopt a family, but I would like to drop some
    money in the pot.  Since I got here through Instapundit, I'll bet an instalanche
    of folks have now read your post.  some of them, at least would be willing to
    defray expenses without going though an institution.

    well."

    when the tea party first started. Great work you are doing for Ferguson.  We don't
    have a whole lot in our coffers, but would gladly push any fundraising efforts
    for the businesses and employees here in Waco, Texas. \r\nLet me know specifics
    and I will push it to my network here. God bless y'all!"

  content: If someone gathers names, I could put together "GoFundMe" pages for the
    major causes. In other words, find me a group of 10-12 families, get me some pics
    of them, get me their STORIES (human interest angle), and they would have the
    best Christmas ever (a "GoFundMe" divided amongst them). Similarly, stories of
    specific repairs, expenses, projects that businesses need. "Need to replace plumber's
    van burned in protest," or something of that ilk. The money has to go to specific
    needs - a hand UP, not a hand OUT.

<p>Nixon buck-passed while Ferguson burned. With the city&rsquo;s main business district laid to rubble, buycotts won&rsquo;t have much effect. And Christmas is around the corner.</p>
<p>Who got hurt last night?</p>
<ol>
<li>People who own businesses</li>
<li>People who work at businesses</li>
<li>People who rely on businesses</li>
</ol>
<p>Time is short. The people affected by last night&rsquo;s riots need help rebuilding and jobs right now. While I don&rsquo;t have complete plans, I can throw out eight ideas. Please make one of these come to life.</p>
<ol>
<li>100 St. Louis companies hire 1 affected person for 1 year. Longer if they wish, but guarantee a job for 12 months starting December 1.</li>
<li>100 companies (St. Louis or elsewhere) adopt one damaged business each to rebuild. And it&rsquo;s not just the businesses with physical damage. Most Ferguson and Dellwood business need out of business funding.</li>
<li>100 St. Louisans can sponsor Christmas this year for one affected family in Ferguson. Start with a list of employees who are out of work because of the violence last night.</li>
<li>Companies and charities can establish a fund for rebuilding destroyed property. Let the private companies&rsquo; CFOs manage the money, not government or NGOs who have a way of making a billion dollars disappear.</li>
<li>What if our well-endowed universities donated from their endowments to a redevelopment fund? Maybe give students credit for helping rebuild.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been asking for this since August, but how about a state sales tax holiday for Ferguson, Dellwood, Florissant, Hazelwood, and other affected cities? If I were governor, I&rsquo;d call a special session next week to pass that law in time for the holidays.</li>
<li>Add an option to the 2014 Missouri Income Tax forms allowing business and individuals across the state to donate from their tax refunds to offset the cost of the state sales tax holiday.</li>
<li>Hold Saturday morning resilience classes for business owners and their employees, followed by a two-hour workday to help in recovery.</li>
</ol>
<p>These ideas need your help.</p>
<p>If you know someone who can make one or more of these ideas come to life, please email a link to this story. Ask them to get it started.</p>
<p>If you have better ideas, please include them in the comments. (Yes, people read the comments almost as much as they read my nonsense.)</p>
<p>Thanks. Let&rsquo;s not let St. Louis go the way of Gary, Indiana. We cannot rely on government&mdash;government is the problem, not the solution. We have to rely on ourselves.</p>
