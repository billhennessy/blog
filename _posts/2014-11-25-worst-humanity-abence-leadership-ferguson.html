  content: The governor and our other Missouri leaders are more concerned with the
    rights of protesters than the rights of business owners.  It is a sad commentary
    on their priorities.  Their silence in the face of violence speaks volumes about
    their lack of courage.  This has brought a huge black mark on the state of Missouri
    and the city of St. Louis.   These protesters are truly the scum of the earth
    but our Missouri leaders are not far behind.

<p>I should be in bed. But I can't take my eyes off the images of Ferguson burning to the ground.</p>
<p>A liberal friend on Twitter admonished me not to be political. Maybe he's right.</p>
<p>But I'm pretty sure Dellena's 911 Beauty Salon burned in Ferguson tonight. It seems everything else has, too. The airport is closed. St. Louis's image may be taking a fatal blow. The region might go the way of Gary, Indiana.</p>
<p>And the governor is absent. The National Guard is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Mandy Murphy on KTVI Fox 2 has reported numerous times the governor promised Ferguson officials and businesses that the National Guard would be there to protect their lives and property.</p>
<p>At least eight buldings are burning to the ground. Bakeries. Restaurants. Parts stores. I shopped in most of them this summer and fall during BUYcotts.</p>
<p>People are watching their humble livelihoods burn.</p>
<p>The fire departments are standing by. They want to fight the fires, but they can't. They can't because the police presence is insufficient to suppress sniper fire from the human feces that use tragedy to unleash evil on good people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the governor is absent. He's chasing that buck that he refused to stop in a disastrous interview that exposed his feebleness.</p>
<p>And, doesn't the Attorney General have a role in all this? I haven't heard his name.</p>
<p>I don't know how we remove a governor in Missouri, but it's damn time to get that ball rolling.</p>
<p>God bless the people of&nbsp;Ferguson. And may God unleash swift and fearful justice to the bastards responsible for this.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The Governor is not taking calls from Ferguson Mayor as he pleads for National Guard support. He cannot get through to any of our Congressional delegation. &nbsp;Care to explain Claire McCaskill? Roy Blunt? Ann Wagner? Lacy Clay? This is the time that leaders lead.</p>
<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;After hours of pleading and tweeting, Govenor Nixon claims he's ordered more National Guard for Ferguson. At this point, one Guardsman would be more. (1:11 am)</p>
