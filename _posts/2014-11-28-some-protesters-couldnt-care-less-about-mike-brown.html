  content: Bill, in my opinion, as soon as the first window was broken, the first
    match lit and the first store looted, it was no longer about Mike Brown and Darren
    Wilson.  Protest should not be about revenge or destruction. It should be about
    bringing attention to a cause to instigate change.   The destruction and criminal
    activity does nothing but perpetuate a negative image and take the focus away
    from what the protesters say they want addressed.  I also happen to be of the
    the opinion that much of what will cure their concerns requires a long hard look
    in the mirror-- as reflected by the actions of their neighbors causing the destruction
    in their community.  But I suppose that is another issue, isn't it?  As usual,
    thank you for your wisdom!

  content: Both reasons for protesting are wrong.  The protesters are using Officer
    Wilson's acquittal for their own political gain rather than to start a reasonable
    conversation.  All the protesters who disrupt business should be arrested and
    thrown in jail.

<p>If you think the mall protests are about the police, Ferguson, Mike Brown, or Darren Wilson, you could be wrong.</p>
<p>For some, Mike Brown is a pawn. The protests are mere opportunities to exploit.</p>
<blockquote><p>Travis Martin, a protester who was at the bowling alley and the Justice Center, said he didn't think that activist leaders had done enough planning and promotion for an event at the Galleria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the main organizers weren't so focused on anti-capitalism. They are more focused on justice for Mike Brown,&rdquo; said Martin, 27, a student at the Washington University School of Law. (source: <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/galleria-reopens-after-protest-demonstration-over-at-west-county-center/article_02e39345-5fba-539a-8262-998b9c2be232.html">stltoday.com</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Got that? The protesters were too worried about justice. Travis Martin seems all about destroying free market capitalism.</p>
<p>I admit that I admire people who take to the streets to express and promote their point of view, even if I don't agree with them. Demonstration, protest, and even civil disobedience are political tools. Used well for just causes, these tools build great communities.</p>
<p>When people honestly and openly use these tools, democracy works. It's okay for people to disagree, but the partisans must be forthright. When protests drive an honest debate, the community or society can choose a course. Protests can initiate debates that matter. But only when the protests are transparent.</p>
<p>When people hide in the shadows of a larger protest, hoping to hijack emotions to destroy the greatest engine for equality, wealth, and advancement in human history, they do not advance democracy; they advance a lie.</p>
<p>Now that Travis Martin has exposed the hidden anti-market ends of the Mike Brown protests, the organizers must purge their ranks of the agitators. If the organizers permit the anti-market agitators to stay, then we are free to call the movement a fraud.</p>
