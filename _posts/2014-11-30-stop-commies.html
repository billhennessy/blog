<p>It's all a lie.&nbsp;<img class="alignright wp-image-15609 size-medium" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/commies-arent-cool-e1417409141719-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>It didn't&nbsp;start that way. At first, the Mike Brown protesters were all about Mike Brown and people like&nbsp;him. But not anymore.</p>
<p>Even the New York Times admitted the protests in Mike Brown's name are actually the Revolutionary Communist Party advancing Marxism. (The NYT pulled down the story on Sunday morning. I wouldn't have linked it, anyway.)</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of stomping on someone else's parade, even if I disagree with their cause. That's why I've been quiet about the Mike Brown protests. Let them have their time.</p>
<p><strong>But communists hijacked their time</strong>. I joined the US Navy's submarine force for one purpose: destroy communism.</p>
<p>Now, communism is here in St. Louis County, and <strong>our wimpy politicians are afraid to act</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's one solution you might like.</p>
<p>Let's get&nbsp;100 people to commit. <strong>Commit to doing your Christmas shopping ONLY at places targeted by the communists</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Commit to spending $100 at every mall, store, and shop where the phony "Mike Brown" protesters target.</strong></p>
<p>Communists want to destroy free market capitalism. The best way to destroy their evil goals is to double down on what they hate: shopping.</p>
<p>They burned Ferguson and Dellwood. So <strong>shop Ferguson and Dellwood.</strong></p>
<p>They disrupted <strong>West County mall</strong> and the <strong>Galleria</strong>. So shop there.</p>
<p>They shut down the <strong><a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/protesters-hit-walmart-off-telegraph-road-leave-ferguson-quiet/article_d53b64d2-eddb-5969-aa58-506862a86463.html">Walmart in South County</a></strong>. So buy your groceries and hunting gear there. And your Christmas presents.</p>
<p>After you shop there,<strong> take a picture of your receipt and send it to bill.hennessy@stlouisteaparty.com</strong> &nbsp;I'll get it it to the store manager, and I'll add up the totals.</p>
<p><strong>Screw the damn communists.</strong> This is America. We kicked their asses once, and we'll do it again.</p>
