    Federalist: http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fedpapers.html\r\n\r\nRead them
    &amp; explain how President Obama's executive order was any less Constitutional
    than the ones all previous presidents have issued. Cruz is a millionaire lawyer
    (part of the Establishment) &amp; knows better but is lying to his xenophobic
    base, hoping to get the Presidential nomination."

<p>The 9 percent who belong to the oligarchical political class hate the rest of us&mdash;except when&nbsp;they're&nbsp;eating from our tables like rabid Vietnamese Potbelly Pigs.</p>
<p>The establishment's latest target: Texas Senator Ted Cruz.</p>
<p>Fox's Bret&nbsp;Baier&nbsp;asked Senator Cruz&nbsp;about critics like George Will and Charles Krauthammer who say Cruz doesn't understand Washington's rules: Congressional politics is a team sport</p>
<blockquote><p>I am not trying to play the rules of Washington, because I think Washington is profoundly broken.</p>
<p>The taxi commissions have done everything they can to kill Uber and Lyft,</p>
<p>What we're trying to do in the political world is very much the same thing [as Uber and Lyft], which is change the means of decision making,take it out of the smoke-filled rooms where decision making is done in Washington between career politicians and lobbyists, and instead empower the people. In my view, the only way we can turn this country around is if the American people rise up and hold every one of us accountable. So I'm not trying to play by the Washington rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Establishment is upset that Ted Cruz had the audacity to question the Constitutionality of<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/12/16/federal-judge-obama-immigration-actions-unconstitutional/" target="_blank"> Obama's unconstitutional amnesty order</a>.</p>
