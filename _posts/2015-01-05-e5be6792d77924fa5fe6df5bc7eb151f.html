<p>Hi Bill, </p>
<p>My name is Connie Cohen and my son is Alex Cohen.  He has gotten a red light ticket in the City of St. Louis while driving his car which is titled in my name.  Due to the way the car is titled, the citation has been issued in my name.  </p>
<p>He has told me not to pay it based on the pending ruling regarding red light tickets in St. Louis.  He said that you played a significant role in getting the decision in front of the Supreme Court.   </p>
<p>I guess my question is should I at least dispute the ticket officially stating that I will not pay it for 2 reasons:  I wasn't driving the car at the time of citation and based on the pending decision in front of the Missouri Supreme Court?</p>
<p>If there is somewhere else I need to get this information please let me know.  I wanted to start with you based on my conversation with Alex. </p>
<p>I also wanted to let you know that I liked your posting/article around election time about voting for the libertarian versus Ann Wagner.  </p>
<p>Thanks Bill!!!</p>
