  content: "At what point does third party finally become a viable option? I see little
    difference between the Bush 41 era GOP that got creamed in 2006 and today's version.
    How many new GOP representatives have been sent to DC in 2 of the past 3 election
    cycles? Over 70 if you count senators. And yet nothing changes.\r\n\r\nGOP voters
    are part of the problem when the same incumbents keep being sent to DC. Folks,
    if Ann Wagner is running ads on every local station during prime time that takes
    a lot corporate/establishment money. There will be strings attached to it, and
    you should know by now, that even if she wins you loose. So start showing up in
    the primary and vote for the guy you never heard of. And if he doesn't win vote
    third party L in the general election.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel Reagan was a curse.
    I personally made the mistake of believing that Reagan was a product of the GOP.
    But the reality of it is, Reagan was an aberration. Reagan pushed his way in and
    the party elite fought him the entire way until he finally secured the nomination
    in 1980. His values are not represented by the GOP party at large. \r\n\r\nIn
    his final farewell speech to the nation he warned us, that conservatism had not
    been institutionalized in DC. History has shown he was right.\r\n\r\nIt took way
    too long and two Bush presidencies to figure it out, but by early 2011 it was
    apparent that the GOP is just the Elephant side of a two headed statist coin.
    All they care of about is profiting from their Washington DC existence and are
    willing to appease the media and any political enemies to preserve the personal
    financial gravy trains and power they have carved out for themselves.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are voting R in the general election with  a picture of Reagan in your mind
    when you are doing so, congratulations, you are part of the problem.\r\n\r\nIt's
    long past time to vote for new blood in the primary, and if the establishment
    incumbent defeats the newcomer in the primary, vote third party in the general
    election.\r\n\r\nNothing is going to change until an informed electorate capable
    of critical thinking overcomes corporate dollars when it comes to winning elections.
    Until that day arrives, expect the GOP to lie to your faces every two years and
    then stab you in the back and reach into your wallet a week after the election
    is over."

  content: "Jim,\r\n\r\nYou ask a question I ask myself often: when does the Democrat-Republican
    oligarchy come down?\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know. Perhaps when enough people
    realize that Democrats and Republicans of the political class have more in common
    with each other than either has in common with us. \r\n\r\nI've written before
    that the left-right dichotomy is dead (here: http://hennessysview.com/?s=dichotomy).
    But few people seem aware of the new dichotomy, or they see it and are afraid
    to act. \r\n\r\nI know that thousands upon thousands of St. Louis County Republicans
    voted for Ann Wagner in November despite knowing that Ann would sell out St. Louis
    County in a heartbeat. But people were afraid to skip that race or vote for Bill
    Slantz, the Libertarian."

<p>The geniuses at Heritage Action put together a fantastic brief explaining everything you need to know about the Speaker election process.</p>
<p>Check this out:&nbsp;<a href="http://heritageaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sentinel-Brief-Speaker-Election-Procedural-Facts.pdf" target="_blank">Speaker Election Procedural Facts</a></p>
<p>For the record, I'd love to see the election go to a second, third, fourth, or ninety-fifth ballot. But I don't expect Boehner to lose. And if Boehner should lose, Gohmert might not win. The winner will need a LOT of Republican votes, and Boehner supporters won't vote for the guy who inserted himself into the race. (If you kill a don, you can't be a don.)</p>
<p>So if Boehner fails to get 50% by a third or fourth ballot, expect him to drop and push another Establishment hack (Paul Ryan) who conservatives will jump to (Paul Ryan) even though he's every bit the Establishment hack that Boehner is (Paul Ryan).</p>
<p>To sum up, yes, I love a good Congressional street brawl--ever since my C-SPAN marathon-watching days in the 80s. ("will the gentleman yield?") &nbsp;But I don't think dumping Boehner will give conservatives anything to cheer about. We'll pound our chests and dare the world to marvel at our awesome tether ball skills, but we'll end up right back where we began.</p>
<p>No, my friends, the Speaker's gavel is not the promised land; it's a flippin' gavel.</p>
