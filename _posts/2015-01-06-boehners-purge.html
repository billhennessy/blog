  content: "Gut-check time.  In 2016 are we in it to win it or in it to WHINE it?\r\n\r\nI
    have heard conservatives everywhere, including on this post, state that they will
    \"NEVER\" vote for Wagner again but immediately qualify that statement with: \"Of
    course I will never vote for her Democrat opponent either because...(fill in the
    reason here).\"\r\n\r\nIt's time to rethink this strategy; it's put up or shut
    up time if we really DO want conservative leadership in congress.  Wagner is a
    numbers person, she is laughing at us all the way back to congress and will continue
    to do so.   With her recent electoral victory margin she realizes taking our vote
    off the board to back a Libertarian, Constitution, Independent, or even a Green
    candidate in the general election is in no way a threat to her incumbency.  The
    way to remove her, IF we are serious, is two pronged:\r\n\r\nA) Run a solid grass-roots
    liberty candidate against her in the primary.  If that candidate wins, then fantastic
    - we have removed a leadership vote for Boehner in the House (he needs 218, so
    hold this thought...) whether our candidate wins or loses the general election.
    \ \r\n\r\nB) If our candidate is defeated in the primary by the establishment
    forces led by \"Crusher\" McConnell, Blunt, and the litany of establishment Republicans
    who banded together and recruited Democrat voters to help defeat Chris McDaniel
    in the Mississippi primary last year (http://www.senateconservatives.com/site/post/2670/thad-cochrans-senate-enablers),
    then our response with any teeth MUST be to SUPPORT ANN WAGNER'S DEMOCRAT OPPONENT
    IN 2016.\r\n\r\n As distasteful as this may seem to some, helping elect a Democrat
    to that seat in 2016 isn't as bad as it appears at first blush.  Here is why:\r\n\r\n1)
    WE didn't cause this; Wagner did with her loyalty to Boehner rather than to her
    Missouri constituents and with her deceitful campaigning in her district.\r\n\r\n2)
    Unless we want to continue to get more of the same, we MUST view the 2016 House
    race as a fight for control of the leadership, NOT which party will control the
    House.  With 247 members in the House the Republicans will need to lose 30 seats
    to lose control of the House.   This will be next to impossible since the House
    seats are gerrymandered to protect the current incumbents.  In fact, it is precisely
    BECAUSE of this gerrymander effect that Republican voters in districts like Wagner's
    MO-2 should rise up to remove her even if it takes electing a Democrat to her
    seat - in addition to sending a strong message, if we are forced to replace Wagner
    with a Democrat in 2016, in 2018 it should be fairly easy to elect a Republican
    in this district and as a minimum we will have removed one of Boehner's key chess
    pieces from the board since the rest of the Missouri delegation seems to follow
    Wagner's lead.\r\n\r\n3) By the numbers:\r\n\r\nHouse seats held by Republicans:
    \   247\r\nSeats needed for control of House:   218\r\n\"Overage\" of Republican
    seats:           29\r\nThis is the total margin we have to play with, i.e. seats
    we could lose nationally and still have Republican control of the House\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse
    seats held by Republicans:          247\r\n2014 Grass-roots/Tea Party votes:           25\r\n2014
    Establishment Republicans:           222\r\nPro-Boehner votes to force coalition:
    \     217\r\nAdditional anti-Boehner votes required:      5\r\n5 more anti-Boehner
    votes would have forced a coalition leadership, whether they were from additional
    Democrats, additional liberty candidates, or...drum roll...establishment Republicans.\r\n\r\nWith
    the current numbers, by removing 5 establishment Republicans and replacing them
    with EITHER grass-roots/Tea Party candidates OR Democrats, the House Republican
    establishment will be forced to come either to us or to the Democrats to form
    a leadership coalition.  With an excess of 29 House Republicans, our 2016 focus
    should NOT be retaining or increasing House seats (as we will be told by the establishment
    we should do), but rather removing Boehner and forcing a coalition leadership
    to emerge with the grass roots.  This is the classic \"addition by subtraction\"
    approach.  \r\n\r\nMissouri currently has 6 establishment Republican representatives
    (\"The Dirty Half-Dozen\") as evidenced by their Boehner-for-Leader votes and
    their 2013-2014 Heritage Action scores (http://www.heritageactionscorecard.com//state/state/mo)
    Wagner, Luetkemeyer, Hartzler, Long, Smith, and Graves.  Removing 5 of these 6
    and replacing them with EITHER grass-roots candidate or Democrats who would vote
    to reduce Boehner's side of the ledger on the leadership vote below 218 would
    send shock waves throughout the Republican establishment, be a major victory for
    conservatism, and would put us on the map nationally; but it will require backing
    the Democrat in their district if they defeat our primary candidate.  \r\n\r\nDo
    we have the political will and resolve to do this?  Obama, Boehner, \"Crusher
    McConnell\", Blunt, and the \"Dirty Half-Dozen\", are all betting that we don't.
    \ It comes back to the answer to the question I posed at the outset:\r\n\r\nIn
    2016 are we in it to win it or are we in it to WHINE it?"

<p>You might have noticed that <a title="Here&rsquo;s How a Mere Mortal Becomes Speaker of the House" href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/01/05/heres-mere-mortal-becomes-speaker-house/">my report on the Speaker election process lacked enthusiasm</a>.</p>
<p>Now you know why.</p>
<p>Boehner is moving quickly to purge conservatives from all committees of meaning. He has vowed to cooperate with the White House and Democrats. He has vowed never to shut down government again, no matter how evil, onerous, or destructive of liberty government becomes.</p>
<p>Boehner has gone full native.</p>
<p>That's a predictable outcome of a failed coup. The conspirators get whacked. Heads are rolling already: From Politco:</p>
<blockquote><p>The removal of Florida Reps. Daniel Webster and Rich Nugent from Rules was meant as a clear demonstration that what Boehner and other party leaders accepted during the last Congress is no longer acceptable, not with the House&rsquo;s biggest GOP majority in decades.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/boehner-allies-out-for-revenge-114007.html#ixzz3O6aDbCUJ">http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/boehner-allies-out-for-revenge-114007.html#ixzz3O6aDbCUJ</a></p></blockquote>
<p>That's right. With a majority this big, let's give Obama everything he wants.</p>
<p>Here's my favorite line from <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/boehner-allies-out-for-revenge-114007.html#ixzz3O6aZ3vI3" target="_blank">Politico</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Boehner&rsquo;s allies have thirsted for this kind of action from the speaker, who say he&rsquo;s let people walk all over him for too long and is too nice to people who are eager to stab him in the back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Like the President.</p>
<p>While we wait for the great GOP majority to destroy itself, half the Capitol, and the economy, let's prepare for 2016.</p>
