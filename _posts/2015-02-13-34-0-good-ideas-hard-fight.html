<p>I was scared. Not afraid to say it.</p>
<p>And some friends turned hostile. They had good reasons. And I was probably a little cavalier. And I talked way too long.</p>
<p>But <a title="I Would Like to Talk to You on Tuesday September 2" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/28/like-talk-talk-tuesday-september-2/" target="_blank">last September I wanted to start something</a> that would help real people in our neighborhood while advancing liberty and upsetting abusive government. Sure, I'd rather upset the federal government in Washington, but my arms are little short to box with Harry Reid. <a title="Why Municipal Courts Matter to Liberty" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/09/05/municipal-courts-matter-liberty/" target="_blank">St. Louis County's municipalities</a>, on the other hand, lie within our reach.</p>
<p>So I took a swing.</p>
<p>Thank you to all of you who joined the fight against abusive municipal courts. Thank you to my friends who disagreed with the fight but stayed on the sidelines. Thank you to frequent adversaries who put aside differences and helped out.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a title="Here&rsquo;s What&rsquo;s Happening on the Muni Courts Front" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/12/09/heres-whats-happening-muni-courts-front/">Auditor Tom Schweich for his early leadership</a> in launching the Municipal Court Project to audit cities suspected of abusing the Macks Creek Law that capped municipal revenue from traffic tickets to 30 percent of the city's revenue.</p>
<p>Most of all, thank you, <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/media/14info/schmitt/Multimedia.html" target="_blank">Senator Eric Schmitt</a>. Despite the risks, you took this fight into the Missouri State Senate. You forged alliances with frequent adversaries and risked some friendships with great conservative Senators around the state.</p>
<p>In the end, your vision and leadership prevailed. On Thursday, the Missouri Senate voted 34 to 0 to pass your bill <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/15info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=160" target="_blank">reducing the Macks Creek cap</a> to 10 percent from 30 percent.</p>
<p>Even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/us/law-enforcement-issues-in-missouri-and-other-states-spur-unlikely-alliances.html?_r=1" target="_blank">the New York Times couldn't help but notice</a> that the right ideas bring together old adversaries. I didn't do much on this issue--far less than many people whose names you'll never hear. But I admit I take a little pride in helping Senator Schmitt's victory.</p>
