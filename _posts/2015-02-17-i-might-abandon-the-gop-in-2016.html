  content: I'm TIRED of dynasties being chosen for our expected approval.  I'm TIRED
    of being told that a third party will never win or will just ensure a Democratic
    win.  I'm TIRED of being lied to (both parties).   I'm TIRED of candidates pretending
    to listen or care - until they're elected.  I can stick to a third party candidate
    - I just wish that  one of the truly conservative Republicans would miraculously
    switch parties and throw the Republicans for a loop!  That would just be FUN!  One
    of my favorite cartoons says . . . I think the Republicans and Democrats are just
    different cheeks on the same butt.

    in 2012, I think its safe to say 7-10 million will stay home if the GOP nominates
    Bush."

    plan will work out great, for democrats and their fearless leader, Hillary.

  content: 'I agree that voting for a "Jeb Bush" in 2016 it would be a big mistake.  Conservative
    voters (notice I didn''t say Republican) need to have courage and conviction rather
    than fear and apathy.  The big question is: how do we convince the conservative
    voters to stop being timid and start being courageous?  If we don''t take a stand
    in 2016 against the Republican dynasty we may never get another chance.'

  content: "Two parties would be enough if one of them put the people before their
    party.\n\nI avoid reading things into the Constitution, so I don't buy the line
    that we have a two-party system. I don't know who told you that, but they lied.
    The parties are a collection of people. Parties make their own rules, like any
    private clubs. It's up to you to join their club, and it's up to them to accept
    you as a member. \n\nThe two parties dominate because many voters lack the will
    to challenge them. I lacked the will for most of my life. But I'm getting over
    that now."

    Thanks, Ellen.

    Our strongest tool is social proof. As more people publicly declare their commitment to abandon the GOP, more people will want to join the movement. So far we have you, JimB, Senator John Lamping, and me. That's a start.

  content: I have decided I will not vote for Jeb Bush if he gets the nomination.
    In my mind he is no different then Hillary Clinton. He is so confident that he
    is snubbing conservatives this early in the game. Lets see him win without us.
    I hoped Blunt and Wagner would get a primary challenge so far not so. I will not
    be voting for those two either.

  content: We in Missouri have the luxury of living in a state which does not matter
    one iota when the electoral college ballots are tallied. In 2008, folks thinking
    as you, claimed that if we in the Show Me State did not vote for McCain, we'd
    get o'bummer. So I voted for McCain, so did a majority of Missouri voters. Guess,
    what happened? The Fourth Reich, that's what. Then in 2012, we in the Truman State
    were told by those same folks that if we did not vote for Romney, we'd get an
    even worse edition of o'bummer. Well, I wasn't buying it and voted for the Constitution
    Party Candidate. Despite my treason, Missouri still sided with the RINO-du jour,
    yet behold once again the golfer-in-charge scored an electoral college win. The
    Fourth Reich on steroids is the result. Only the presidential votes in maybe 15
    states count. A candidate could win every other state and still lose. States are
    allotted electoral college voters by simply adding their number of U.S. House
    Districts (variable) and U.S. Senators (2). But then most states give their entire
    electoral college slates to the candidate receiving at least a simple-minded majority
    state-wide. This means that a win in Texas or California counts considerably more
    that one in Missouri or Alaska. Instead each states electoral college vote should
    be split to the winner of the presidential vote in each congressional district
    with the Senatorial votes picked by the State Senate (or 1 from the Senate and
    1 from the House). When that glorious day comes and a vote for Gary Johnson's
    Neighbor's Two Dogs is factually wasted, except in protest, you might have a point.
    But as for now, I see very little to be inspired by any RINO on the national stage
    other than a precious few.

  content: I was on this bandwagon back in 2011, though I still voted selectively
    for downstate RINOs (by selective I mean the Constitution party did not have a
    candidate in a race - I don't like libertarians either. They are wrong on abortion
    (I'm pro-life), on any foreign wars and immigration.

  content: Say Bill, Interesting take, but I am going to do my best to see that an
    Establishment RINO like Jeb is not the nominee. Ted Cruz and Scott Walker are
    early favorites of mine. As for Senator Lamping being on board for your proposal,
    I want to let you know when I ran for the Missouri Senate against Ryan McKenna
    the Republican powers that be cut a deal with Lamping and McKenna to not support
    me and the Democraps would not support Lamping's opponent. I lost the election
    by around two thousand votes, with no help from the Republican Party.

    in the EC cast their votes, none of this actually matters. It's kind of disheartening

    not proven to be a Constitutional Conservative. If a politician can't prove their
    Constitutional Conservatism, they don't get my vote, even if I have to abstain
    from voting in any or all races. I'm sick and tired of voting AGAINST certain
    candidates. I want people to vote FOR in elections.

  content: "Well, the split here is obvious, though disappointment is universal. I
    refuse to kill ourselves with such a split. To me the answer is the compromise:
    take over the R.s and spoil the establishment's grip. We have a very good, yet
    certainly imperfect advance on this, and if I was in an army in this situation,
    I WOULD NOT SURRENDER !  How foolish it would be to do so. Patience IS a virtue!
    I can be just as patient as the progressives have been to get us here. Progressives
    unite as well, no matter what, mostly. They love splitting their enemies in two.
    There is no need to give them that victory.There is NO guarantee the grass is
    greener on the other side of this battle. I am sticking this thing out to the
    finish, not curling my tail between my legs, even if I risk my life.\r\nPlease,
    let's unite and give this everything we've got!  Jees!"

<p>Why have conservatives and right-leaning libertarians made so little progress since 2009?</p>
<p>Consider that the GOP was written off for dead following the 2008 election. Republicans disappeared from the press. When a Republican popped up on a Sunday talk show, he was talking about compromise and getting along.</p>
<p>Then the Tea Party happened, and all of a sudden the GOP's testes descended. But after two off-year wave elections that gave the GOP their largest majorities since Hoover, the GOP seems poised to double down on the crony capitalist, elitist policies and candidates that got them tossed out of Washington in 2006 and 2008.</p>
<p>If conservatives and right-leaning libertarians gave the GOP its spine, why isn't the GOP using it?</p>
<p>Simple. Republican party leaders work to increase&nbsp;their own personal power. They want to take power from you and me and use it for their personal benefit.</p>
<p>I can't say I blame. I mean, that's precisely what we want to do, isn't it? We want to wrestle power away from Washington and use it ourselves. We echo William F. Buckley who wrote in <em>Up From Liberalism:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I will not cede more power to the state. I will not willingly cede more power to anyone, not to the state, not to General Motors, not to the CIO. I will hoard my power like a miser, resisting every effort to drain it away from me. I will then use&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;power as&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;see fit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our problem with the modern Republican Party is that its candidates pretend they're on our side in the battle of personal power. But they're not. They're on their own side. This isn't a two-way war between us and Washington; it's a <em>guerre a trois</em> between us, Washington, and the GOP.</p>
<p>The reason we're losing ground is our weak&nbsp;tactics. When the shooting starts every two years, we take bullets for the Republicans. When they win, they leave on the battlefield to bleed out.</p>
<p>The alternative is to make the game more interesting. Here's how.</p>
<p>Even if all the principled conservatives and right-leaning libertarians banded together, we could not elect third party candidate. But we could deny&nbsp;Republicans the win.</p>
<p>The only way for that to work is to make a strong early commitment and stick to it. Which is what I am doing in this post. I am declaring that <strong>I will not cast a Republican vote in any race in 2016 if the GOP nominates Jeb Bush as it's candidate for President.</strong></p>
<p>Some will urge me to vote Republican for office like governor. Nope. None.</p>
<p>If the GOP nominates Bush, I'm pulling a Libertarian ballot in the primary and voting straight Libertarian or Constitution Party ballot in November.</p>
<p>The down-ticket candidates provide a lot of support and cover to the party's up-ticket candidates. Jeb Bush would look a lot less tolerable to Tom Schweich and John Hancock if his nomination meant another Democrat governor and losses in the Missouri General Assembly.</p>
<p>If enough voters committed to voting&nbsp;third party (or staying home) were Bush nominated, state parties throughout the country would distance themselves from Bush.</p>
<p>Bush has all the money locked up.The only way to stop his nomination is to make that nomination a sure defeat for the GOP nationally and in the states. It's a recognition that we're in a three-way war for power. it's telling the establishment that we're crazy enough to point our weapons at the side most likely to surrender to us.</p>
<p>So there's my plan. If the candidate's Bush, I walk. And I'll work against ever Republican on my ballot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
