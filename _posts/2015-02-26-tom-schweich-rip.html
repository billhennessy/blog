<p>News of Auditor Tom Schweich's death hit me hard. If you haven't heard, <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-auditor-and-governor-candidate-tom-schweich-has-died/article_879ddcd7-c997-5df3-bc61-39282c4f7434.html" target="_blank">St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported to day that my friend Tom Schweich died of a gunshot wound</a> today. Tom was 54.</p>
<p>I am saddened by this news. I pray for Tom's family and for his rapid entry to eternal happiness.</p>
<p>May perpetual light shine on him, and may his soul and all the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace.</p>
