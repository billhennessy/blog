  content: "Ferguson could still use your business. \r\n\r\nAlso,  Dellena can cut
    any type of hair. We have a small go fund me page for her salon as business has
    not picked back up in 6 months and her 4 stylists have gone elsewhere.     http://www.gofundme.com/911salon"

<p>Ben Evans worked hard to host a joint event with St. Louis Tea Party Coalition and Heritage Foundation a couple years ago.</p>
<p>Because of Ben's hard work, we met Dottie.</p>
<p>Then the trouble in Ferguson happened last August. Fearless Dottie joined our band of BUYcotters who went to Ferguson to shop while the city still smoldered.</p>
<p>We met Dellena.</p>
<p>Dottie cultivated a relationship with Dellena.</p>
<p>Saturday, February 28, Dellena hosted Level One training in Self-Governance at her 911 Beauty Salon on W. Florissant at Canfield in Ferguson.</p>
<p>Level One teaching centers on understanding political power: its source, its control, and its uses. Also, how the corrupt bastardize language to steal your power for themselves.</p>
<p>This is profound work. These are profound ideas that transcend the busy work assigned to us by the political parties. The parties want us working on their elections and fighting against our neighbors. But Self-Governance training helps us get beyond party and faction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a handful of people took a giant step toward learning they have all the power they need to own their own lives. The veil was lifted thanks to Dottie, Ben, Mark Herr, Dellena, and many others.</p>
