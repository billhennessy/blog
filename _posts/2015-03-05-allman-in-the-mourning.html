  content: "I thought Danforth s comments in the 2nd part of his homily were better
    suited for a press conference than a funeral. \r\n\r\nThrew me off all day. Needed
    to be addressed. And it obviously had impact. But it felt very odd and out if
    place.\r\n\r\nI didn't hear what alman said on this."

  content: Now I am very glad that I don't wake up early enough to listen to this
    97.1 show.  I never clicked with Allman anyway.  I heard part of Senator Danforth's
    eulogy for Tom and was deeply moved by his honesty.  Let the truth be told.

  content: Thanks. I believe Danforth felt the message fit the circumstances. As an
    ordained Episcopal priest, he is bound to try to right the listing souls before
    him. I admire his honesty.

  content: My concerns with Danforth is he headed the white wash investigation of
    WACO. So, he cannot be trusted.

<p>I hear that Jamie Allman ripped into Senator John Danforth yesterday.</p>
<p>Allman called Danforth a failure and a thug. According to Allman, Danforth's sin was defending a friend against lies, defending a people against centuries-old hate.</p>
<p>I guess Jamie Allman and his handlers like lies and hate.</p>
<p>I'd hate to be Jamie Allman on judgement day.</p>
<p>Just sayin'.</p>
<p>Mourning for Jamie's soul.</p>
