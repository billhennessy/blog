  content: "I suspect you can trace North County's current problems to the housing
    bubble.  Clinton/Bush policies of \"community improvement loans\" and \"cheap
    money\" pushed housing money out to unqualified borrowers.  Home values shot up
    along with property tax assessments and municipal income.  \r\n\r\nWhen the bubble
    burst, foreclosures and short sales hit North County hard.  Assessed values went
    down.   Unpaid tax bills piled up.  And commercial development cratered.  \r\n\r\nI
    suspect municipalities decided to enforce existing laws more aggressively which
    has lead to more traffic stops, arrests for outstanding warrants and more citizen
    complaints.  For cities, it was one existing area of revenue to tap.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I hope these small municipalities survive.  Otherwise the areas become \"unincorporated\"
    which spreads the cost of services over the entire county (including me).  Countywide
    taxes will have to go up."

  content: "Craig,\n\nThe housing bubble didn't help. The closing of the Hazelwood
    Ford plant, shifts in payroll at Boeing, and loss of other engineering and manufacturing
    in the area all contributed. An underlying problem is the level of government
    services people expect. At the root, though, is the combination of geography and
    technology. A century ago, many small cities might have made sense. Today, they
    don't. \n\nPlus, the human factor. Exploiting power to extract money is a moral
    deficiency."

  content: "I have been saying this for quite awhile now, police of today have become
    revenue producers. It was that way when I retired from the police department back
    in 1990. One time at roll call, they read from the desk book that a record was
    set for traffic violations, however parking tickets were down. It's all about
    the money. I preferred to go after the really bad guys and was constantly asked
    about the lack of tickets I wrote.  That was one of the reasons I was never promoted.
    I did well on the tests and ranked in the upper 10% but was told my \"productivity\"
    was lacking. Today, they have red light and speed cameras, which are sold to the
    public on the ruse it's about safety. In reality, it is about the money. These
    \"city leaders\" use that money to provide services, thus the ticket revenue has
    to be maintained , which leads to corruption when they shortened the yellow to
    get more drivers. Recently in New York, they were complaining about the lack of
    revenue coming in, because of the \"slowdown/boycott\" where no tickets were being
    written. The officers were then threatened with sanctions if they continued to
    not write tickets. In Chicago, there is a major shortfall due to no revenue coming
    in from the contested red light cameras. So, this practice of police becoming
    revenue producers is not just in Ferguson, but in many if not all police departments.\r\n
    \r\nThat is why I am calling on Missouri Congress to ban the use of red light
    and speed cameras in the state. They are not about safety, but revenue and are
    one of the complaints coming out of Ferguson. It is my understanding that Representative
    Paul Curtman is working on a bill. I am also calling on them to ban the use of
    Compliance and DWI checkpoints. They are a violation of the people&rsquo;s Constitutional
    rights and 12 states already ban the use of them. The states in which sobriety
    checkpoints are illegal are Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,
    Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Let&rsquo;s make
    Missouri number thirteen."

  content: "Thanks, Greg. Thanks for reminding me of the problem of cameras and checkpoints.
    \r\n\r\nIn addition to the DWI checkpoints, the federal government pays police
    departments to operate DNA checkpoints. Police stop every car and pressure occupants
    to submit to DNA sampling. (I am not making this up.) \r\n\r\nBecause of the authority
    of police, people are afraid to say \"no.\" The feds know this and abuse police
    authority to build a DNA database of supposedly free people. \r\n\r\nRead this:

  content: "The part that many people miss is simple...\r\nIs it OK for the Municipalities
    of St Louis to violate any and every law they find inconvenient? Particularly
    every constitutional protection of Missouri and the United States.  Do you find
    it offensive when the criminal accuses you of being the bad guy?\r\nIf it is OK
    to rob people because you want more money. Why are so many bank robbers and liquor
    store robbers in prison?\r\nLastly, what is worse then gross violations of the
    law is the hypocrisy of these corrupt government officials.. Lets list them\r\n1.
    All Mayors of North County\r\n2. All city council members of North County\r\n3.
    All Police chiefs and leadership for North County police department\r\n4. Each
    judge in north county... As each one violates Rule 2 of judicial ethics, and Rule
    37 of Municipal court rules. US Constitution and Missouri Constitutions in nearly
    every case before them.\r\n5. The hypocrisy of corrupt government officials accusing
    people of doing bad things for the sole reason to pick their pocket or to falsely
    imprison them. Liars, thieves and kidnappers.\r\n6. Actually, every-time a Muni
    judge sends someone to jail for failure to appear. They are violating Missouri
    Law. And every-time they throw someone in jail for contempt they are violating
    the law (no citation of contempt, it is illegal imprisonment). As they are required
    to cite contempt and schedule it for a hearing with another judge.... but the
    weasels are guarding the chicken coop....\r\n7. Judge Brockmeyer and his peers
    are ALL guilty of judicial ethics violations...because every judge who is aware
    of misconduct by another judge is required by rule 2 (article 5 section 5 Missouri
    constitutions) to report the misconduct to the state judicial ethics commission.
    But they all see a totally corrupt court as they way things are in St Louis and
    if you want justice you get sent to jail....in violation of Missouri law.\r\n\r\nHow
    about we look out for the Citizens of the United States, and the Citizens of Missouri....
    for the morons who tell me to vote.. I am a victim of rentier. To go 10 mlies
    east, I have to cross 8 rentier jurisdictions with revenue agents on the prowl..\r\n\r\nHow
    about we get an honest judge to reverse EVERY conviction in the last 5 years that
    violates due process of law and the rules of the court......that is every case
    UNLESS the court can show competent evidence that they obeyed Missouri Law, Rule
    2, and Rule 37.. Which they never do so every conviction MUST be overturned."

  content: "While I've been frustrated by having to pay speeding tickets over the
    years, it was my fault for violating the speed limit. When I parked in a no parking
    zone and got a ticket in  Clayton, that was my fault too. While I agree that it
    is wrong for money-grubbing city officials anywhere to use police officers as
    exploitative revenue generators, the same laws apply to all people. The same laws
    must apply to all people, right? \r\n\r\nAre the laws themselves bad? I hate red-light
    cameras, as I've been their victim too many times. I think we should get rid of
    them too. What about speeding laws? I think we should keep them.\r\nNo parking
    zones, or metered zones? Pain in the rear. But, probably necessary for public
    order and safety in most cases. Driving without a license? Think we should keep
    it. \r\n\r\nSo, should police officers enforce these laws? Should they enforce
    them only for people of certain income level, or certain ethnicity? Should citizens
    repeal laws in their cities that they don't like? Yes, of course. Should we put
    limits on the amount of revenue a city can \"earn\" in a given  year through fines
    associated with the aforementioned ordinance violations? Say, the limit is reached
    in June. Then people violate the laws the rest of the year with impunity?\r\n\r\nAre
    police \"targeting\" poor blacks to generate city revenue, or just enforcing neutral
    and sensible safety laws on those who break them regardless of race, ethnicity,
    etc.? If revenue was the objective, and \"targeting\" was considered a legitimate
    means to the end, wouldn't it make more sense to \"target\" whites who may have
    a better financial picture to exploit?\r\n\r\nIn the instance where an official
    \"fixed\" a ticket, I heard the mayor or police chief say that it was done to
    cancel the ticket for a van driver at the city pool who was transporting at-risk
    poor children. That sounds like a kindness to me, not corruption.\r\n\r\nExisting
    data shows that blacks break laws disproportionately. I think many poor blacks
    feel that because they are poor they don't have to obey the same laws as everyone
    else. I think there is also a profound disrespect among blacks regarding the rule
    of law, law enforcement officers, other people's property, and, yes, white people.
    Yes, anti-white racism is not miniscule. \r\n\r\nPrior to the tragic, but preventable,
    incident in Ferguson last August, I thought Ferguson was a model for an integrated
    community. I live in Florissant, and worked at Emerson Electric for 25 years,
    just blocks from Canfield drive. I am familiar with Ferguson. My 62 year-old cousin
    grew up there and she believed the same thing. The \"hands-up, don't shoot\" meme
    poisoned the minds of everyone in the days following the incident, and was proven
    false. \r\n\r\nIt is utterly astonishing to me that the black community, by and
    large, being all for social justice and justice in general, prejudged officer
    Wilson with endless libels and slanders. This prejudice extended into the press
    and TV coverage. There were death threats for the \"racist cop\". In the end,
    he was found innocent by the DOJ. What about justice for Darren Wilson? Will the
    liars and perjurers be brought to \"justice\"?\r\n\r\nCities have budget problems.
    Salaries, pensions, other costs. How can they solve their budget problems? I don't
    know. I suppose there are many ways to do so. So what's the solution? \r\n\r\nShouldn't
    there be a \"common knowledge\" among the poor of every ethnicity to obey the
    law because of the costs of breaking it? Instead of the prevailing  \"snitches
    get stitches\" proverb, there should be a prevailing \"obey the law\" proverb.
    Why don't the \"leaders\" of the poor encourage this? Why don't they tell their
    people that having children out of wedlock (72% for blacks), and squandering educational
    opportunities is a recipe of lifelong poverty? Why don't tell them that their
    rampant sexual immorality and criminality will destroy their lives? Why don't
    they tell them that laws effect all people regardless of income class or ethnicity?\r\n\r\nMy
    grandparents grew up poor (both sides of the family, one north city, the other
    south.) They didn't have all the taxpayer financial support that poor today have.
    But, they somehow made it work. They applied their hearts,  minds, and physical
    strength to do what they could. When poor people address the issues mentioned
    in the previous paragraph, I guarantee they will have less poverty. Maybe they
    simply don't have the human capacities to progress along the right path. I don't
    know."

  content: Blake, may I use your comment as a testimonial to this site?
---
<blockquote>The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but&nbsp;they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but&nbsp;it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd."</p>
<p>--Alexis de Tocqueville,&nbsp;<em>Democracy in America</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Because of business travel and meetings, I postponed reading the Department of Justice report on Ferguson until. late, late last night. And I didn't read all of it. I tried to focus on the parts we can do something about or learn from.</p>
<p>There are many. And there are many opportunities for distraction. Those distractions will interest some radio talkers, for sure, but distractions block action.</p>
<h3>The Big Distraction</h3>
<p>Let's get this out of the way first. I'm not surprised that Eric Holder's DOJ puts such an emphasis on race. Neither do I dismiss the racial aspects of the report. I think it's reasonable to assume that at least some problems in Ferguson owe to attitudes toward people of another race.</p>
<p>Some may&nbsp;use the report's racial overtones to discredit the entire document, though, and that would be a mistake. I've edited out references to race in several of the quotes. Race &nbsp;might matter to Holder, but not to me. Abuse is abuse no matter the victim's color.</p>
<p>The meat of the story here is corruption driven by government greed, as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/christina.kbo?fref=nf">my friend Christina Botteri</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/@christinakb." target="_blank">@christinakb</a>)&nbsp;pointed out. The people perpetrating the corruption are not the police, but the city officials who direct police activity.</p>
<p>Eric Holder's name can drive conservatives and libertarians to distraction. Please read the report, or a summary of the report, open to the possibility that some of the findings are true. Then consider the corroborating evidence we have uncovered in our Municipal Courts project.</p>
<p>Reading the report with an open mind and in light of evidence we already knew about police and court practices in many Missouri cities, we realize that Eric Holder's last major work is a gift to the liberty lovers of America. Take it as such and act.</p>
<h3>Taxation By Citation</h3>
<p>The first and clearest finding in <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/19/end-game-ferguson/">the report is no surprise to anyone who reads this blog.</a> <strong>Ferguson treats citizens like the government's ATM machines</strong>. From the report:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>City officials routinely urge Chief Jackson to generate more revenue through enforcement. In March 2010, for instance, the City Finance Director wrote to Chief Jackson that <strong>&ldquo;unless ticket writing ramps up significantly before the end of the year, it will be hard to significantly raise collections next year. . . .</strong> Given that we are looking at a substantial sales tax shortfall, it&rsquo;s not an insignificant issue.&rdquo; Similarly, in March 2013, the Finance Director wrote to the City Manager: &ldquo;Court fees are anticipated to rise about 7.5%. <strong>I did ask the Chief if he thought the PD could deliver 10% increase.</strong> He indicated they could try.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Public safety, crime prevention, and investigations--you know, the stuff police are supposed to do--rank below revenue generation in Ferguson:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Patrol assignments and schedules are geared toward aggressive enforcement of Ferguson&rsquo;s municipal code, with <strong>insufficient thought given to whether enforcement strategies promote public safety</strong> or unnecessarily undermine community trust and cooperation. Officer evaluations and promotions depend to an inordinate degree on &ldquo;productivity,&rdquo; meaning the number of citations issued. Partly as a consequence of City and FPD priorities, <strong>many officers appear to see some residents&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time when I was about to enter the St. Louis Police Academy, I spent some time with a senior detective about to retire. He told me, "there's three kinds of people in the world: perps, victims, and cops."</p>
<p>I felt sorry for him. At the time, I hoped I never developed such cynicism. I thought I understood how such an attitude could develop working with crime all one's life. But I hoped to avoid it. (I got a job offer while waiting to class up and never became a police officer.)</p>
<p>The daily pressure to write &nbsp;more tickets and arrest more people on ordinance violations seems to accelerate a cynical attitude. My friend Dan, who testified before Senator Eric Schmitt's committee on the Mack's Creek law, told me&nbsp;a friend of his, and former Ferguson police officer, turns down numerous offers to return to law enforcement because of police and civilian leaders who twist good cops into "ticket jockeys."</p>
<h3>Revenue Needs Lead to Civil Rights Abuses</h3>
<p>The report describes a familiar tactic police use to create a situation that leads to more fines and jail time: abuse of authority.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>This culture within FPD influences officer activities in all areas of policing, beyond just ticketing. <strong>Officers expect and demand compliance even when they lack legal authority</strong>. They are inclined to interpret the exercise of free-speech rights as unlawful disobedience, innocent movements as physical threats, indications of mental or physical illness as belligerence. Police supervisors and leadership do too little to ensure that officers act in accordance with law and policy, and rarely respond meaningfully to civilian complaints of officer misconduct. <strong>The result is a pattern of stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment</strong>; infringement on free expression, as well as retaliation for protected&nbsp;expression, in violation of the First Amendment; and excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am tempted to say, "but Holder's DOJ violates the Fourth Amendment all the time." And "what about the NSA?"</p>
<p>True. This report on Ferguson raises hypocrisy to new heights. But just because the authors of the report violate the law does not mean the report is wrong. It just means we have more work to do.</p>
<p>The report describes how this abuse of authority works:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>For example, in the summer of 2012, a . . .&nbsp;man sat in his car cooling off after playing basketball in a Ferguson public park. An officer pulled up behind the man&rsquo;s car, blocking him in, and demanded the man&rsquo;s Social Security number and identification. <strong>Without any cause, the officer accused the man of being a pedophile</strong>, referring to the presence of children in the park, <strong>and ordered the man out of his car for a pat-down, although the officer had no reason to believe the man was armed</strong>. The officer also asked to search the man&rsquo;s car. The man objected, citing his constitutional rights. In response, <strong>the officer arrested the man, reportedly at gunpoint, charging him with eight violations of Ferguson&rsquo;s municipal code.</strong> One charge, Making a False Declaration, was for initially providing the short form of his first name (e.g., &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Michael&rdquo;), and an address which, although legitimate, was different from the one on his driver&rsquo;s license. <strong>Another charge was for not wearing a seat belt, even though he was seated in a parked car.</strong></p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>That story is only one example that fits a pattern easy to identify. If people won't commit a minor municipal code violation, police in towns like Ferguson will bully people into committing something. It seems that <strong>I could be arrested for introducing myself to a cop as "Bill Hennessy."</strong> What if I gave my post office address of Pacific instead of the actual location of my house, Wildwood? Would that constitute Making a False Declaration?</p>
<p>And, since when was a false declaration a crime? Why isn't the Ferguson PD arresting the President for declaring, "If you like your insurance, you can keep it?"</p>
<p>Let's move on to the Ferguson Municipal Court.</p>
<h3>The Kangaroo Court and Its Tax-Owing Judge</h3>
<p>The DOJ report addresses directly a common problem with municipal courts. They don't even pretend to dispense justice. They operate only to extract as much money as possible from anyone unlucky enough to wander through their doors. Ferguson's court is like some backwater Mexican jailhouse.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>The municipal court does not act as a neutral arbiter of the law or a check on unlawful police conduct. Instead, the court primarily uses its judicial authority as the means to compel the payment of fines and fees that advance the City&rsquo;s financial interests.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the perfect description of a problem in dozens of municipal courts around St. Louis County.</p>
<p>Now, some have criticized our muni courts project, asking "don't you believe in law and order, Bill?"</p>
<p>Yes, I do. And I believe the first law is the law that restricts government. Which is why government officials who break the law should face stronger penalties and harsher rebukes than citizens who commit similar violations.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Most strikingly, the court issues municipal arrest warrants not on the basis of public safety needs, but rather as a routine response to missed court appearances and required fine payments. In 2013 alone, the court issued over 9,000 warrants on cases stemming in large part from minor violations such as parking infractions, traffic tickets, or housing code violations. Jail time would be considered far too harsh a penalty for the great majority of these code violations, yet Ferguson&rsquo;s municipal court routinely issues warrants for people to be arrested and incarcerated for failing to timely pay related fines and fees.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Just days after the DOJ released its report on Ferguson, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/06/ferguson-judge-owes-unpaid-taxes-ronald-brockmeyer" target="_blank">The Guardian reported that the judge</a> of that court, Ronald Brockmeyer, owes a lot of taxes, himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>The judge in Ferguson,&nbsp;<a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Missouri</a>, who is accused of fixing traffic tickets for himself and colleagues while inflicting a punishing regime of fines and fees on the city&rsquo;s residents, also owes more than $170,000 in unpaid taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>How low of a lowlife is Brockmeyer?</p>
<blockquote><p>Investigators found <strong>Brockmeyer had boasted of creating a range of new court fees, &ldquo;many of which are widely considered abusive and may be unlawful&rdquo;</strong>. A city councilman opposing the judge&rsquo;s reappointment was warned &ldquo;switching judges would/could lead to loss of revenue&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brockmeyer is part of the revolving door of municipal court abusers. He's judge in Ferguson and prosecutor elsewhere, teaching other towns how to extract more blood from their citizen-turnips. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/06/ferguson-judge-owes-unpaid-taxes-ronald-brockmeyer" target="_blank">From The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brockmeyer, who has been Ferguson&rsquo;s municipal court judge for 12 years, <strong>serves simultaneously as a prosecutor in two nearby cities and as a private attorney</strong>. Legal experts said his potentially conflicting interests illustrate a serious problem in the region&rsquo;s judicial system. Brockmeyer, who reportedly earns $600 per shift as a prosecutor,&nbsp;<a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/5-on-your-side/2014/11/05/prosecutors-serving-double-duty-as-judges/18574803/" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link">said last year</a>&nbsp;his dual role benefited defendants. &ldquo;I see both sides of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s even better.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Brockmeyer needs those 'abusive and unlawful" fees and fines he's so proud of to pay his back taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Brockmeyer symbolizes the rentier model of Ferguson</strong> and similar cities in St. Louis County. "Rentier" refers to the medieval practice of land barons of demanding large fees simply for crossing their land. The land itself was granted to them by the king--the barons did not buy it. And every inch of some countries were controlled by some baron. Public roads were subject to private tolls. But the barons added no value. They did not improve the roads or offer protection to travelers. They only took. "Rentier."</p>

<blockquote><p>The court imposes these severe penalties for missed appearances and payments even as several of the court&rsquo;s practices create unnecessary barriers to resolving a municipal violation. The court often fails to provide clear and accurate information regarding a person&rsquo;s charges or court obligations.</p></blockquote>
<p>We learned that from Dan Hyatt and <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/20/municipal-court-kangaroo-court/">Lee Presser.</a> Both white, upper-middle-class. Dan and Lee showed that Breckenridge Hills and Bel-Ridge courts fail to comply with Missouri Supreme Court rules on the conduct of court, the preservation of evidence, and the recording of proceedings.</p>
<h3>The Snare of Muni Courts</h3>
<p>Getting tangled up in the muni court system can lead to a nightmarish carnival of mayhem for the poor.</p>

<blockquote><p>We spoke, for example, with an African-American woman who has a still-pending case stemming from 2007, when, on a single occasion, she parked her car illegally. She received two citations and a $151 fine, plus fees. The woman, who experienced financial difficulties and periods of homelessness over several years, was charged with seven Failure to Appear offenses for missing court dates or fine payments on her parking tickets between 2007 and 2010. For each Failure to Appear, the court issued an arrest warrant and imposed new fines and fees. From 2007 to 2014, the woman was arrested twice, spent six days in jail, and paid $550 to the court for the events stemming from this single instance of illegal parking. Court records show that she twice attempted to make partial payments of $25 and $50, but the court returned those payments, refusing to accept anything less than payment in full. One of those payments was later accepted, but only after the court&rsquo;s letter rejecting payment by money order was returned as undeliverable. This woman is now making regular payments on the fine. As of December 2014, over seven years later, <strong>despite initially owing a $151 fine and having already paid $550, she still owed $541</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's easy to say, "she should have gone to court." You'd be right. But going to court would not have helped if she didn't have the money to pay.</p>
<p>Further, why is it okay for government--our creation and our servant--to abuse its master? Why can Judge Brockmeyer invent "abusive and unlawful fines" to levy on poor citizens, but the citizen goes to jail and if she can't or won't pay those abusive and unlawful fines?</p>
<p>It's backwards.</p>

<h3>Ferguson Has Two Kinds of People</h3>
<p>That old cop who told me of three kinds of people was wrong. In cities like Ferguson, where revenue generation trumps everything else, police are victims, too. That leaves two kinds of people: perps and victims.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most disturbing about the reality of cities like Ferguson, Missouri, is&nbsp;the human suffering the&nbsp;system creates. Citizens are not the only victims.&nbsp;The police are victims, too. Darren Wilson was a victim of the system that built walls of hostility and distrust between the police and the people they were supposed to serve and protect.</p>
<p><strong>No one goes to the police academy hoping to write lots of tickets that turn into bench warrants</strong>. People&nbsp;become cops because they know civil society needs brave and patient officers&nbsp;who show up at bad situations, keep their heads about them, and settle everything down before figuring out what really happened and writing a report for judges and juries to weigh.</p>
<p>But municipal greed&nbsp;turns these men and women&nbsp;into Sheriffs of Nottingham, finding feeble excuses to extract more tax dollars from citizens for the benefit of a rentier government scheme. And the judges are the perps.</p>
<h3>Take Action</h3>
<p>After reading the DOJ report, I feel compelled to thank Senator Eric Schmitt and his co-sponsors again. Also, thanks to the people who testified for Senator Schmitt's bill that reduced the cap on traffic fines to 10 percent of a city's revenue. But there's more work to be done.</p>
<p>First, that Mack's Creek bill that passed the Missouri Senate 34 to 0 needs to pass the House. I spoke to State Representative Shamed Dogan who said he expects the bill to pass, but not as surely as it did in the Senate. <strong>Write your Missouri State Rep</strong> and ask him or her to support SB-5.</p>
<p>While Senator Schmitt's bill was a great start, it's not enough. Auditor Tom Schweich began the process of enforcing the Mack's Creek law, but he is not around to complete that work. You can <strong>email the interim auditor, John Watson</strong>, and ask him to continue <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/12/09/heres-whats-happening-muni-courts-front/">Schweich's Municipal Court project.</a> His email is&nbsp;moaudit@auditor.mo.gov.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to see <strong>criminal penalties for mayors, judges, comptrollers, and city managers</strong> who impose unlawful fines and fees or try to violate the Mack's Creek law. Right now, the law only allows the state to abolish abusive muni courts. But guys like Judge Brockmeyer will just migrate to another town and set up shop. As I said, government officials who break the law should face stiffer penalties than citizens.</p>
<h3>Free People, Not Sheep</h3>
<p>As I wrote back in September, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/09/05/municipal-courts-matter-liberty/">the municipal court problem is a liberty issue</a>. Blindly accepting whatever a town's police and courts dish out softens people. It prepares us to accept any abuse, any civil rights restriction, the government wants to impose. In the words of 19th century <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/07/29/just-freedoms-losing/">French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville</a>, these courts and police practices reduce us to "a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd."</p>
<p><strong>Let's stop these abuses now.</strong></p>
