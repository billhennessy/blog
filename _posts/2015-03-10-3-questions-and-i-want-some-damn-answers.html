  content: "We did work on something nobody believed we could fix and we did.\r\nWe
    learned that there are corrupt and extremely biased people who will never allow
    a consensus. We have a judge shown by US DOJ to be extremely corrupt and unethical.
    And he still has protectors and defenders. Buying and selling justice, three  classes
    of citizens.. those that will be jailed for non violations, those that will pay
    the rentier tax, and those who are friends of those in power whom the laws do
    not apply.\r\nAND the cities who are corrupt and openly doing illegal taxation
    and demanding more.. Mayors in Jeff city in January SB5  \" but we need the money
    we do good things\"....I talked to 100+ professional black women who live in North
    County NONE of them can think of any good things the cities there do.\r\n\r\n3.
    I don't know about you... but if we could reform government by making it smaller,
    less regulation, and less taxes.. AND FORCE GOVERNMENT TO OBEY THE CONSTITUTION.
    Do we care who gets the credit?  As long as it is not the socialists, communists,
    or  dishonest politicians."

  content: "...bring in a whole bunch of sand from the Gulf, some hardy fan palms,
    and a huge bamboo bar, putting them on a large section of the Lake of the Ozarks
    or other body of MO water, which can be stocked with deep sea fish for as long
    as they can stand it, a yacht and a good old patriot rock band."

  content: Laws and statues.  For every new law that is put on the books (muni, state
    and federal), let's require that TWO need to come off the books.  Many obscure
    statues and laws that are outdated need to be removed.  I've seen my small city's
    BIG book of ordinances and if you need to try to look something up - you better
    have a lot of time on your hands.

<p>What would happen if we if worked on:<br />
1. stuff we could actually fix<br />
2. stuff no one could complain about fixing<br />
3. stuff we didn't care who got credit for fixing?</p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Next question:<br />
1. Name one thing that needs fixing that meets all&nbsp;three criteria<br />
(and think of people you hate when answering question 2)</p>
