<p>Want to know why Net Neutrality is dangerous?</p>
<p>Forget the Constitutional stuff. That's important, but most people don't care. Seriously. As soon as you mention the Constitution or mercantilism, the 99% walk away.</p>
<p>And the remaining 1% already agree with you.</p>
<p>No, the way to scare people about Net Neutrality is this chart from Statista:</p>
<p><a title="Infographic: Which Industries Have The Worst Customer Service?  | Statista" href="http://www.statista.com/chart/3281/which-industries-have-the-worst-customer-service/"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width: 960px; -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" src="https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_3281_Which_Industries_Have_The_Worst_Customer_Service_n.jpg" alt="Infographic: Which Industries Have The Worst Customer Service?  | Statista" /></a></p>
<p>You will find more statistics at <a href="http://www.statista.com/">Statista</a></p>
<p>The only thing worse than Comcast's customer service? Comcast's customer service regulated by the federal government.</p>
<p>Net Neutrality is the happy name of a plan to make the second-worst customer service even worse.</p>
