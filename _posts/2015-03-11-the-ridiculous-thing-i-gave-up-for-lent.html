<p>"What did you give up for Lent?"</p>
<p>Ever get that one? Like it's something you're supposed to post on your Facebook page.</p>
<p>A very good priest I knew, Dom Oppenheimer, warned against revealing one's Lenten sacrifice.</p>
<p>"When you tell others what you gave up for Lent, you're likely to feel some pride," he explained. "But pride is the worst sin."</p>
<p>That actually makes a lot of sense when you think about. So does his other Lenten sacrifice advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give up something small, not something big. If you give up something big, you'll be tempted to feel . . . pride.</li>
<li>
<p>Give up something inconsequential rather than something you ought to give up anyway. You ought not smoke, so giving up smoking isn't really a sacrifice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indulge in your sacrifice on Sundays because Sunday is the day God the Father set aside as a feast for&nbsp;His son, our Lord. To deny yourself at a feast insults the host. So indulge on Sundays in Lent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What was the inconsequential, non-benefitial thing I gave up&nbsp;every day but Sundays of this Lent?</p>
<p>I just tweeted a link. And I'm not proud. ;-)</p>
<p>What did you give up that you can't reveal?</p>
