<p>Please look at the Rockwood April 7 bond issue and the proposed 74 million dollars, also a consultant from the pact Glenn Construction has been hired as a consultant for the bond and Board will hire if the bond issue passes. This is the past company that the deceased auditor Tom Schweich found overcharged the district.<br />
Same old cronyism and same waste of taxpayer dollars.<br />
