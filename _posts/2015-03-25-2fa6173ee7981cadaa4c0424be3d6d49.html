This analysis of the DOJ two-part report merits everyone's attention. One point that struck me is that the accuseds' accounts of the many allegations are not provided. Who knows if the activist wing of the DOJ even attempted to corroborate the accusations or to get the accuseds' version of the stories. I give a lot of credence to Heather's analysis. She is truly an expert on these matters.<br />
