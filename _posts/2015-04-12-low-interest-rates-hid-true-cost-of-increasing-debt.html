<p><em>House mortgage-type instrument suggested as means to pay off national debt</em></p>
<p>Guest Post By Lee A. Presser</p>
<p>Interest rates have been held artificially low by the Federal Reserve since 2008.&nbsp; This has had the effect of hiding the true cost of increasing debt.&nbsp; As interest rates rise back toward 4%, the U.S. Treasury will have less money to spend on discretionary governmental functions.</p>
<p>The FY 2015 budget is approximately $3,900,000,000,000.00.&nbsp; Another way to look at that number is about $12,187.50&nbsp;per person for all 320,000,000 people in the U.S.</p>
<p>The $3.9 Trillion budget has been divided by the Treasury into three main categories; mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and interest costs.&nbsp; In FY 2015 mandatory spending will equal 65% of the budget.&nbsp; Mandatory spending is America&rsquo;s entitlement programs.&nbsp; Discretionary spending is everything else including the military, except interest costs.</p>
<p>The interest amount paid on the United States national debt may be about to sky-rocket as interest rates in the U.S. return to 4%.&nbsp; Instead of paying&nbsp;<strong>$430,812,121,372.05</strong>&nbsp;interest at an average 2.401% rate as the Treasury did in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, the amount may soon grow to&nbsp;<strong>$769,861,040,000.00</strong>&nbsp;if rates return to 4.188%, the average rate at the end of FY 2008.&nbsp; (Treasury Department websites&nbsp;<a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2008/2008_09.htm">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2008/2008_09.htm</a>)</p>
<p>The $769.8 Billion calculation is based on the debt amount as of&nbsp;<a href="http://airmail.calendar/2015-09-30%2012:00:00%20CDT">September 30</a>, 2014.&nbsp; The actual amount of interest paid when rates return to 4% will be based on a larger amount than the $18 Trillion owed&nbsp;<a href="http://airmail.calendar/2014-09-30%2012:00:00%20CDT">September 30, 2014</a>.&nbsp; When the amount owed reaches $20 Trillion, the annual interest amount paid could be as high as $855,401,140,000.00 (based on a 4.188% rate rather than a 2.401% rate).</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<strong>debt</strong>&nbsp;generally refers to money owed by one party, the debtor, to a second party, the creditor. Debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest.</p>
<p>(Wikipedia&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>National debt is the money owed by the central government (in this case the United States Treasury) to its creditors; those who loaned it money at interest.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<strong>national debt</strong>&nbsp;is different than the&nbsp;<strong>annual deficit</strong>.&nbsp; The deficit measures the amount the debt has increased from one year to the next year.</p>
<p>The interest rate paid by the U.S. Treasury on its debts varies depending on the contract it signed with each creditor.&nbsp; The &ldquo;interest bearing debt&rdquo; generally falls into two categories; &ldquo;marketable&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marketable&rdquo; securities.&nbsp; The average interest rate of all the subcategories making up the &ldquo;marketable&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marketable&rdquo; securities is called the interest rate on the &ldquo;Total Interest Bearing Debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the close of FY 2007, the &ldquo;Total Interest Bearing Debt&rdquo; rate was 5.009%.&nbsp; By the close of FY 2008 the rate declined to 4.188%.&nbsp; At the close of FY 2014, the &ldquo;Total Interest Bearing Debt&rdquo; rate was 2.401%.&nbsp; (Treasury Dept. website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2014/2014_09.htm">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2014/2014_09.htm</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When interest rates rise and the debt continues to increase (because of deficit spending), the United States Treasury has less dollars to spend on discretionary governmental functions.&nbsp; Since interest must be paid to avoid default, discretionary spending must be cut.&nbsp; The other option is to increase the deficit and add to the debt.&nbsp; A larger debt results in increased interest costs in the coming Fiscal Year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A change in trajectory is needed to avoid financial disaster.&nbsp; Perhaps the solution is to assign the federal debt to a 30-40 year mortgage and pay it off like a house payment.&nbsp; As the debt amount declines, more money will be applied to principal.&nbsp; Of course, no addition debt can be added.&nbsp; Increased expenses must be paid from current income and/or from increased taxation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Congress cannot agree to control itself, financial disaster is predictable and has been explained above.</p>
