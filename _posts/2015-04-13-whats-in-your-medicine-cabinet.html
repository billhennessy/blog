  content: "Did I miss something, it is my understanding the bill has already passed
    in the House and Senate. I have contacted many Representatives on the legislation
    for them to kill the bill. The following are some of the things I wrote: \" There
    is a bill in the Missouri legislature creating a government database for everyone's
    prescription drugs. Apparently, the sponsors of the bill have forgotten about
    the NSA spying,the IRS intimidation on American citizens and Jay Nixon using the
    DOR to target gun owners. There is no need for more intrusion into people&rsquo;s
    lives by government. This is another database that will be used to control the
    people. Blaine Luetkemeyer and Ann Wagner voted on an amendment to a bill wherein,
    if you take certain prescription drugs you would be banned from owning a gun.
    This bill needs to be defeated.  \r\nApparently, the sponsors of the bill and

<p>Missouri is the only state that doesn't track your medical prescriptions.</p>
<p>People say it like it's a bad thing.</p>
<p>What's wrong with the government not knowing that one bit of information about your private medical life? Can't government keep out of at least this one, extremely personal matter?</p>
<p>The do-gooders and busy-bodies want Missouri to maintain a database (tied into similar databases in all other states) that keeps a permanent record of every prescription a doctor or dentist writes. The state's compelling interest is . . . "we're curious."</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
<p>Look, a big corporation makes its money running prescription databases for states. They've sold 49 licenses for their product, which means the company's growth prospects are shrinking fast. Missouri is the only hold out, so this company is lobbying hard to get Missouri to surrender.</p>
<p>No. We're not going to surrender.</p>
<p>Call your State Senator and ask him or her to filibuster this attack on privacy. Thanks to MOPP, here's what you need to know:</p>
