<p>"What if everything goes wrong?"</p>
<p>I remember asking myself that on the morning of Friday, February 27, 2009.</p>
<p>I was driving on I-44 headed to the Arch to host a Tea Party. My co-hosts were people I'd never met: Dana Loesch, Gina Loudon, Ed Martin, Michelle Moore. Those were the three to offered to help. Others offered to speak: Jim Lembke, Shamed Dogan, and a few others. Others helped organize sign-making, food, sign-in sheets, and music.</p>
<p>I'd never met any of them before that day. They'd never met me.</p>
<p>Of the people who responded to the Facebook event page, I knew exactly two. I'd gone to high school with them. The rest were strangers.</p>
<p>Among the hundreds of strangers could be crazies bent on destruction. Or hard-core leftists bent on destroying us. A bunch of&nbsp;neo-Nazis&nbsp;could show up and taint us all.&nbsp;Someone could get hurt. Many could get hurt. I could get arrested. &nbsp;Or, God forbid, someone might hand a&nbsp;megaphone to Roy Blunt.</p>
<p>A thousand things could go wrong. In fact, the chance of pulling off a major public, political event as a first-time activist was extremely small. People were angry and frustrated, and I called them together for a meeting before God and press.</p>
<p>Whatever went wrong would be on me.</p>
<p>The fear seized me as I passed Kingshighway. I was getting close to downtown. No turning back. My son, Patrick, was in the passenger's seat asking questions, but I couldn't fathom what his words meant. "Hmm?" I'd ask.</p>
<p>"Nothing," he'd say.</p>
<p>You know how I knew I was doing the right thing? The fear. Everything of value involves conquering fear. If you approach an activity without fear, it's an activity of little value to the world.</p>
<p>Eric Greitens writes of this odd brain signal in his book Resilience:</p>
<blockquote><p>Such fears are entirely natural and healthy, and you should recognize them as proof that you&rsquo;ve chosen work worth doing . Every worthy challenge will inspire some fear.</p></blockquote>
<p>From <em>Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life</em></p>
<p>When people say they're afraid of Eric Greitens, smile. They should be. Eric Greitens' election is a worthy challenge, and worthy challenges always stoke up some good, healthy fear.</p>
<p>Here's why <a title="The SEAL, the Race, and the CEO" href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/04/10/the-seal-the-race-and-the-ceo/">Eric Greitens reminds me of Aslan from Narnia</a>.</p>
