  content: Thanks for the link! Someone saw this story on The Missouri Torch and donated
    $50. The person doesn't live in the St. Louis area but wants to help restore a
    community torn apart. Thank you.

<p>We met<a title="Why St. Louis Tea Party Went to Ferguson To Shop" href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/08/21/why-st-louis-tea-party-went-to-ferguson-to-shop/" target="_blank"> Dellena Jones during our first Ferguson BUYcott in August.</a> Since then, St. Louis Tea Partier, Dottie Bailey, has made it her mission to help Dellena's business survive and flourish.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/r-ye3nSe2Vk</p>
<p>Dellena's business has fallen 60 percent since the first riots. She's repaired the damage to her salon, but business is slow.</p>
<p>Despite all her challenges, Dellena still found the time and energy to host Center for Self-Governance training in her shop on a Saturday, foregoing that day's revenue to learn about freedom and responsibility.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg" target="_blank">This GoFundMe project </a>won't clean up the debris around her shop, but it will help her survive until the area gets cleaned up.</p>
<p>We have a goal of raising $20,000 for Dellena, but we need your help.</p>
<p>Here's what you can do today.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg" target="_blank">Pledge $1 for every goal the Blues score</a> in their playoff series with Minnesota.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg" target="_blank">Pledge $10</a> for every Blues win.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg" target="_blank">Pledge $2</a> for every Cardinal run scored in the next week.</p>
<p>Post this link to Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp;http://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg</p>
<p>Visit the 911 Hair Salon on W. Florissant in Ferguson -- and buy something.</p>
<p>Donate what you can today.</p>
<p>The flip-side of Liberty is Responsibility, and we all need a mission in life that's bigger than ourselves. Just $1 for Dellena Jones will let you say, "I did something."</p>
<p>If you believe in small business, in recovery, and in free enterprise, why not help this woman keep her dream of independence through hard work alive?</p>
