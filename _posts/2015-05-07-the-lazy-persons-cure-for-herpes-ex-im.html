<p>Every six months.</p>
<p>Just when you can you least afford it.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>A breakout.</p>
<p>It's <strong>Herpes Ex-Im, a cronyism disease that can make the prettiest economic system look sick</strong>.</p>
<p>Herpes Ex-Im is a virus that attacks your economy's competitive system, resulting ugly blemishes. Even your lover won't want to kiss you.</p>
<p>But there's a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Left untreated by Congress, Herpes Ex-Im will die.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The free-market system has built-in defenses against crony diseases like Herpes Ex-Im. Certain behaviors, like Congressional action, can compromise&nbsp;your economy's immune system, allowing Herpes Ex-Im to spread.</p>
<p>The good news <strong>Congress can cure this ugly, painful disease by doing what Congress does best: nothing.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If Congress ignores the Export-Import Bank, it will die in June.</p>
<p>Write your member of Congress and Senators. Ask them to ignore the Export-Import Bank reauthorization and let the free market destroy the virus known as Herpes Ex-Im.</p>
