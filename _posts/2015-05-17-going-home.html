<p>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</p>
<p>But if that step is in the wrong direction, you might end up 2,000 miles from your goal.</p>
<p>Many believe America took a step in the wrong direction long ago--about the time "progressivism" became popular among political, business, and academic elites in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>If progressivism was a step in the wrong direction, it's led us at least 2,000 miles from our target.</p>
<p>Modern progressives tell us we need to keep going in the wrong direction and we'll eventually find what we're looking for. They seem to forget Seneca's line:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When you are travelling on a road, there must be an end; but when astray, your wanderings are limitless.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Modern conservatives and libertarians realize that we're off course, that we're moving away from the target, and that continuing to wander astray will lead us further from the goal.</p>
<p>But some conservatives and libertarians seem lost, too. They want to wait for a miracle that transports them back to the starting point to begin the journey anew. Or, better yet, they hope to be transported immediately to the target.</p>
<p>The journey home--to the starting point with continuing service to the goal--begins, like the original journey, with a single step. Continuing to wander is idiotic. Waiting for a miracle is stupid.</p>
<p>Wise&nbsp;people just turn and start walking, one step at a time.</p>
