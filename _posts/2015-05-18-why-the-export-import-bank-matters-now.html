<p>Start small--end big.</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you know someone who woke one morning and ran a marathon having never so much as walked around the block.</p>
<p>No hands?</p>
<p>Of course not. A few freaks of nature might be able to go from zero to 26.2 in no time, but most people would hurt themselves trying. And never do it again.</p>
<p>When a sane sedentary person decides to run a marathon, he starts by walking. Then jogging. Then learning. Then applying what he's learned to extend his runs. And so on. Eventually, barring injury, he runs a marathon.</p>
<p>Missouri's Republican Congressional delegation wants you believe it can get all limited-government at once.</p>
<p>Call Ann Wagner's office to talk about Ex-Im and you'll hear a litany of reasons why she should vote to extend the First Federal Bank of Cronyism. Among her (<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/09/10/heres-ex-im-facts-ann-wagner-claire-mccaskill-wont-tell/">discredited</a>) reasons will be: "Ex-Im isn't the battle to fight. It's too small. Let's keep our powder dry for something big!"</p>
<p>Right. What I hear is this: "I don't have the guts to fight mega-corporations over something small, but I'll miraculously find courage to fight for the flat tax or the Transportation Empowerment Act or something monumental."</p>
<p>She might actually believe it. Some people believe they could go out and run a marathon anytime they choose without working up to it.</p>
<p>They're both wrong.</p>
<p>If the GOP, with majorities in both houses, lacks&nbsp;the courage to let Ex-Im sunset&nbsp;now, who believes they'll find the courage to stand up to crony corporations over something really big?</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote about <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/05/17/going-home/">a nation 2,000 miles off course</a> and people who want to wait for a miracle to get their country back to the starting line to try again. The Missouri Republicans who want to extend Ex-Im now and save their energy for a Really Big issue later fall into this trap.</p>
<p>There is no magic potion.</p>
<p>There is no rainbow-colored limited-government pony.</p>
<p>There is only way to walk back the mistakes of progressivism: turn around and start walking.</p>
<p>If Republicans can't take the corporate heat from cooking Ex-Im, they won't stay in the kitchen for the recipes that really matter.</p>
<p>I'm not asking for Ann Wagner or Roy Blunt to repeal the 17th Amendment; I'm asking them to do the right thing on a matter they say is too small to think about.</p>
