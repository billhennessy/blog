  content: "If you look up this bill, it is a complete \"laundry list,\" and I think
    it's absurd for legislation to become what I heard one legislator call a \"Christmas
    tree,\" and if ever there was a bill festooned with goodies, this would be it.
    \ The law is not someone's candy dish! \r\n\r\nPotpourri bills like this diminish
    accountability--the people can't keep track of what's in the bill, and besides
    that, it no doubt gets undesirable legislation passed on the coattails of good
    bills when a legislator is faced with pleas from his constituents to rectify something
    that's of great concern.\r\n\r\nArticle III Section 23 of the Missouri Constitution
    says that bills shall be limited in scope to one subject.  I'm in favor of having
    our state government abide by the state constitution they swear an oath to, so
    I say let's hear it for Ron Calzone!"

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jefferson City, MO, May 29, 2015 - A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/14info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=28134657">Senate Bill 672</a>, passed by the Missouri General Assembly in 2014, was filed in Cole County circuit court on May 29<sup>th</sup>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">The lawsuit claims that the General Assembly ignored the constitutional limits to their legislative authority. The Missouri Constitution includes clauses that prohibit legislators from changing the purpose of a bill, including multiple subjects in one bill, or passing a &ldquo;special law&rdquo; that fails to treat everyone equally. The lawsuit claims lawmakers violated all three provisions and asks the court to strike down the entire bill.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">Additionally, the lawsuit seeks to establish &ldquo;citizen standing&rdquo; in court to make such legal challenges. Courts currently recognize &ldquo;taxpayer standing&rdquo;, or the right of taxpaying citizens to sue when the law being challenged somehow affects the taxes he pays, but &ldquo;standing&rdquo; is not guaranteed a citizen if neither taxation nor government expenditures affect him.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">If the &ldquo;citizen standing&rdquo; claim is recognized by the courts, the door will be opened for similar suits even when the laws being challenged don't affect the taxes of the person filing the lawsuit.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">The plaintiff in the challenge is Ron Calzone, a political activist and one of the founding directors of Missouri First, Inc., a think tank devoted to promoting constitutional governance. Although not an attorney, Calzone filed the suit &ldquo;pro se&rdquo; (Latin, &ldquo;for&nbsp;</span></span>oneself<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">&rdquo;), in part to demonstrate that the abuses by the General Assembly are so blatant that even a non-lawyer can succeed in legal challenges against some of their bills. He also hopes that it will encourage other citizens to bring similar challenges as long as the General Assembly refuses to abide by the constitutional limits on their powers.</span></span></p></blockquote>
