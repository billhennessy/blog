<p>I'll make this brief.</p>
<p>If we must respect (revere?) the erstwhile Bruce Jenner for self-identifying as a woman, we have to respect Rachel Dolezal for self-identifying as black.</p>
<p>Both voluntarily left the world of privilege, as it were, to join an underclass--an identifiable minority. Jenner left manhood; Dolezal left whitehood.</p>
<p>The left doesn't see it that way, though. Apparently, rejecting one's biological sex is okay, but rejecting one's biological race isn't.</p>
<p>My advice to Caitlyn Jenner: stop at sex. If you decide you're black, all that goodwill you're feeling will disappear.</p>
<p>Because hypocrisy is Greek for progressive.</p>
