  content: "Once you reach irrelevancy there is only an upside. :-) You can't become
    more irrelevant! St. Louis became irrelevant in the 60's and local political pundits
    strive to maintain the irrelevancy. \r\n\r\nOr \"even a blind squirrel can sometimes
    find a nut\" . . . except in St. Louis."

<p>Here's what happens when you raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to scientists:</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Well, not nothing. <a href="https://mises.org/library/yes-minimum-wages-still-increase-unemployment" target="_blank">All kinds of bad things happen to the economy</a>. But nothing happens for two groups of people central to the whole debate: workers who get a bump to $15 and employers who have to bump to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>Most cities and states that have raised their minimum wage laws to $15 will phase in the increase over five years. That pretty much means the market will have adjusted to the change long before it becomes effective. But that's a terrible scenario to test my theory, based on research by Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert.</p>
<p>Let's do this instead: let's raise the minimum wage to $15 in 30 days.</p>
<p>But first, let's give a standard happiness survey to a thousand minimum-wage earners before we announce the increase. And let's give the same test to wager payers.</p>
<p>Then, let's re-administer the test to both groups 30 days after the minimum wage hike goes into effect. And let's test them all again one year later.</p>
<p>To keep the experiment clean, the final analysis will include only those who a) kept their minimum wage job for the whole year, or b) kept their minimum-wage paying business open the whole year.</p>
<p>I can tell you the results. One year after the minimum wage goes to $15 an hour, workers making minimum wage will be just about as happy as they were before they learned the minimum wage was going up. Same for the businesspeople who pay them.</p>
<p>In between, just after the wage jumps to $15, worker will be euphoric and owners will be miserable.</p>

<p>It's called the hedonic treadmill. Even if we ignore the economic effect of a big jump in minimum wage (like business failures and <a href="https://mises.org/library/yes-minimum-wages-still-increase-unemployment" target="_blank">higher unemployment</a> for those who most need entry-level jobs), we know from science that people adjust quickly to changes in their circumstances.</p>
<p>When you get a new car, it's awesome, but a year later, it's nothing special.</p>
<p>When you buy a new pair of shoes, you love them. And even if they're still in great shape a year later, they're just a pair of shoes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thefusionmodel.com/do-you-need-to-climb-off-the-hedonic-treadmill-to-be-truly-happy/" target="_blank">Dan Gilbert found that one year after winning the lottery</a> and one year after becoming paralyzed, both groups of people were just about as happy as they were immediately before those life-changing events.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dan Gilbert, (1) a Harvard psychologist has researched lottery winners and found that &lsquo;the happiness effect&rsquo; starts to decline after just a few months. Once the initial elation of getting the big cheque has worn off , people seemed to return to their previous level of happiness or unhappiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Raising the minimum wage to $15 is a political ploy with economic downsides and no long-term benefit for the people who get the minimum wage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, helping a $7.25 an hour worker&nbsp;<em>earn</em> a 100 percent raise does wonders for that person's life, outlook, and self-esteem while providing economic benefits to his employer, his family, and his community.</p>
<p>So go ahead and double the minimum wage, Francis. It will do nothing but accelerate St. Louis's slide toward irrelevancy.</p>
