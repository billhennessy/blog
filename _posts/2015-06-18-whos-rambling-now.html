<p>Someone who met Bill Clinton told me, "I rambled. He probably thought I was an idiot."</p>
<p>No. Bill Clinton wanted you to ramble. He wanted to make you the most important person in the room for two minutes. He listened for&nbsp;a nugget of information--a story--he could use in his next speech.</p>
<p>If you're running for office remember: the most important person in every room is the voter you're talking with. Let her ramble.</p>
