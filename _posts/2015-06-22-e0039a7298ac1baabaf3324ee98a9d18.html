<p>Bill,<br />
Thank you for taking the time to speak in support of Mike Flynn in Quincy on Flag Day. It is unfortunate that the attendance was not greater however your comments were clearly heartfelt and sincere. Rarely do I engage in direct contact to support a candidate. This time is much different and you inspired me to do just that. </p>
<p>On the Presidential front I have had some thoughts. Currently we have a host of qualified, and unqualified, candidates having announced or preparing to announce their intentions. Once again my fear is that the true Conservatives will be taken out one by one by the eGOP candidates as has been the pattern for several Presidential election cycles. The time has come for leaders to lead and to sacrifice their personal ambitions in favor of a consolidated front to address the attacks in service to the American Citizen. To this end would I would advocate a departure from the norm that has not served us well.</p>
<p>Mark Levin, nearly a year ago, advocated that Conservatives need to consolidate behind one candidate. This concept I have mulled on for many months and have come to this conclusion. The time has come to break the normal pattern of operation that the campaigns endeavor under. In Parliamentary models it is referred to as forming a government. Various factions come together to form a coalition to consolidate their strength and put forward a unified front. Under our scheme each of the Conservatives find themselves pitted against one another through the Primaries to disadvantage one another and expose themselves to the slings and arrows of first their own Party candidates and then the opposition Party.</p>
<p>The stakes are high and bringing the Conservative candidates together to form a unified front would be a huge challenge. The model conceptually looks like this. Selection of one candidate to be the head of the Conservative ticket, the others, should agreement be found, could actually be identified and selected for inclusion in the other Executive Branch Cabinet positions and announced to the public. This provides a unified front with all candidates advancing conservatism, programs, policy, centralizes funding and allows for a team to move forward as opposed to an individual to attack and address the opposition rather than the time and ammunition wasted in the typical primary fights. One conservative message, one portfolio of conservative programs and policies, one team of selfless Conservative leaders acting as one to turn the tide of the Progressive left and the eGOP.</p>
<p>Should it work it changes the status quo. Assuming adherence to the programs and policies put forward to the public it could perpetuate the Conservative agenda for several Presidential terms providing opportunity in successive election cycles for those who sacrifice their short term ambition in service to the County, the Citizens and our progeny.</p>
<p>Perhaps a pipe dream. Doing the same thing again is suicide in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your wonderful blog and your dedicated support of conservative policy.</p>
<p>Respectfully,<br />
Warren L Ellis<br />
Quincy, IL<br />
