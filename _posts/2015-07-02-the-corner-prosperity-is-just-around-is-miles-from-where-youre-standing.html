  content: "As usual it takes me several days to digest a discourse with you Hennessy!\r\n\r\nAbout
    15 years ago a great mentor of mine said to me...\"you all are born for a time
    such as this, God makes no mistakes\".  Huh..what..??? At that time in my early
    20's I was worried more about my hair and make-up than anything of substance...and
    I think I had been out that whole night before. I had no idea what she was talking
    about... And back then I was so immature... I could barely handle a break up with
    a loser boyfriend. \r\n\r\nLike anyone that has lived on planet earth life moves
    forward and you figuratively fall down a couple flights of stairs and things happen.
    I've lost a child, have a failed marriage, have had business success and failure
    and learned some reallllly hard lessons.  But like iron is refined by fire, so
    it is with many life lessons if you can make it through with your brain, humor
    and common sense still in tact (and my 3 inch heels). \r\n\r\nI see now what my
    mentor many years ago was talking about.  For lack of a better term, when the
    proverbial crap hits the fan...we won't run, cry and hide.  So many people have
    made it through really hard times, those are usually the most kind, loving and
    generous people....not to mention the most interesting and won't bore you to tears
    w/ stories about their vacations to Mexico. \r\n\r\nLike our friend Dellena, in
    Ferguson, that had her Hair Salon tore up in the riots of last August has picked
    herself up and is now on the Ferguson Civilian Task Force and educating others
    on virtues of Self Governance. She is a prize of a human being and the will and
    attitude of a hero. \r\n\r\nSo are we ready to endure, we shall see? But I'm sticking
    with the flawed, imperfect folks who have been through battles....hey, like you
    Hennessy! ;)\r\n\r\nAnd 'yes' I will probably always be a Green Shoot:) --I was
    born w/ a Sunny Disposition! \r\n\r\nWait...did you call me a psycho?"

  content: Relax kids, worse things could happen and probably will and you will come
    through it because of who you are. You have brains and grits and a will to survive.
    I have seen and experienced worse. Total collapse of the government structure
    - no food, no money, no law and you are totally on your own. My mother's house
    became an island for us - people from the farthest corners of the 3rd Reich thrown
    together and totally dependent on each other. And we survived and we coped and  at
    the end of tunnel the American GI's were our salvation. Lets hope some American
    tribe will be at the end of your tribulations.

  content: "We are not Miles from the solution...Most of the solution is obeying the
    law.. That is government obeying the law.\r\nFor the people to \"violate the law\",
    you must have violated a legitimate law AND harmed someone\r\nFor the government
    to \"violate the law\", they just need to refuse to obey the law when called on
    it.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\nFiscal success - eliminate all frivolous regulations,
    \ state license for hair weavers, no felons for tattoo parlors, and illegal search
    and seizure of property when the cities of St Louis require you submit to a general
    search when you sell or rent your property (violates US Constitution).\r\n\r\nThis
    encourages opening and growth of small businesses, which drive the local and national
    economy.  It increases tax revenue without increasing taxes. It creates jobs,
    \ and spurs the economy.\r\n\r\nFrivolous municipal violations and inspections:\r\nremoves
    discretionary income and even base expense income from those on the borderline
    denying them to enjoyment of the gains of their own industry (Constitution says
    these cities \"fail in their chief design\")   Helps create a market where there
    are many vacant houses, ripe for vandalism and lowers values in the neighbourhood...thus
    decreasing tax revenues."

<p>William Hennessy:   Psychopomps are carriers of the dead, but they carry them to their afterlife.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Cool!!</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   We are in that phase of history. The 20th century is dying, or dead</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Makes me sad though.</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   Everything that we called &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for all our lives lies listless in the beaks of sparrows&mdash;psychopomps&mdash;on their way to a new birth.</p>
<p>That rebirth won&rsquo;t happen for another 5 to 10 years. So this is purgatory for America. We&rsquo;re being cleansed of our 20th century sins</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  So we have not that much time.</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   These 5 years will seem like an eternity.   The worst years since the Depression and WWII.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  I know that is what I'm afraid of. I know it's coming.  Will Greece happen here?</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   People my age who witnessed the 60s and 70s will look back on those &ldquo;upheavals&rdquo; with fondness. They seemed so dramatic at the time, but they were vacation compared to what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>No. We&rsquo;re not that lucky. Greece will get through this relatively unscathed.</p>
<p>They went first. If they vote No Sunday, they&rsquo;ll have been the first to dive into the abyss that separates the 20th century from the future.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  It's Revelation playing out. Damn I thought we were suppose to be gone.</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   No. We have front-row seats</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Oy vey.</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   Did you read <a href="http://davidstockmanscontracorner.com/good-on-you-alexis-tsipras-part-1/" target="_blank">David Stockman&rsquo;s post on Greece</a>? It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  No I'll have to look it up.</p>
<p>Is this in the 4th Turning book...the whole depression thing?</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   Yes. But it&rsquo;s not depressing. It&rsquo;s life. It&rsquo;s how it works. And as Fr. Corapi liked to say, &ldquo;we know how it ends; the good guys win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  No I mean "the depression" like 1929?</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   Oh. Sort of. It will be different. But there will be a climax to the Crisis The Crisis started with Lehman Brothers in 2008 It will end 15 to 20 years later    All of the &ldquo;green shoots&rdquo; in between are wishful thinking, but don&rsquo;t hate the wishful&mdash;it&rsquo;s human nature And the climax MUST happen so we can move on.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  I'm a green shoot sometimes;)</p>
<p>Climax is another word for reset?</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   Not exactly. The climax of the last Crisis was WWII. The Depression was the bulk of the Crisis  10 years of Depression + 5 years of world war.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  That <em>is</em> Revelation</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   After came the the High&mdash;18 years of hope and optimism and growth.</p>
<p>Then Kennedy was killed, and  the culture became very spiritual and questioning, seeking broader understanding.</p>
<p>Awakening from the Stepford Wives world we&rsquo;d been in since Japan surrendered</p>
<p>That lasted until Reagan&rsquo;s re-election in 1984.</p>
<p>Then we started getting cynical and nasty. The mood darkened. As Howe and Strauss put it, despite remarkable peace and prosperity, we felt like society was unraveling.</p>
<p>Gen X came of age, adopting the freedom of their older Boomer siblings and the hard edge of their WWII parents and grandparents That ended with the fall of Lehman Brothers because us Xers turned out to be right: it was all screwed up, but we&rsquo;re tough enough of deal with it. And we probably deserved it.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  This is great. Keep going</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   But it gets really bad. People always think prosperity is just around the corner. In America, it usually is.</p>
<p>But sometimes, it&rsquo;s miles away.</p>
<p>This is one of those times.</p>
<p>Like 1938 and 1860 and 1776.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Geez</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   In each of those years, we thought the worst was over. But the worst was just ahead.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Sooo true.</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   This is why novels are way better preparation for life than history. Historians never catch the mood of the time, the false optimism.</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl saw it in the concentration camps. The people who thought liberation was just around the corner all died.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Jesus.</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   The ones who lived to make life a little better that day, accepting that that day might be their last chance to make something better&mdash;they lived.   Some of them, anyway.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Like the POW in Greitens book. He accepted what was happening and it gave him hope. He didn't fool himself.</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   Exactly. James Stockdale.</p>
<p>Dottie Bailey:  Yes, Stockdale!!</p>
<p>William Hennessy:   If I were honest, this is what I&rsquo;d blog&mdash;what I just wrote. Because this is what I really believe will happen in the next 5-10 years. But I don&rsquo;t have the guts.</p>
