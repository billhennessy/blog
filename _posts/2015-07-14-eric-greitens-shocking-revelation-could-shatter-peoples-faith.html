  content: "I too had heard the \"rumors\" and will investigate Greitens. I do believe
    individuals can come to new understandings and change course. As a Christian,
    what bigger change of course can one take than be on the way to hell because of
    my sin but be turned around and headed to heaven because I trusted Christ as my
    Savior and He paid the penalty for my sin. I am always frustrated that office
    holders who had \"committed\" to supporting a bill or rule or program who is presented
    with new information is reluctant to \"go back on his word\" even though he has
    new information. \r\nWhat does bother me about Greitens for sure is his statement:\r\n\"So
    what would I do? I believe in limited but effective government. I believe in replacing
    ObamaCare with something that actually works. I believe in putting working families
    and job creation ahead of special interests. I believe that in a free society
    we have to defend religious liberties and the 2nd Amendment, and protect innocent
    life, so everyone has the freedom to pursue happiness. I believe in reforming
    welfare, so every person can have a chance at a life of dignity, purpose, and
    meaning. And I believe America&rsquo;s public schools should be the best in the
    world.\"\r\nIt all sounds good - typical Republican jargon. Replace Obamacare
    with something that works. Sounds like more government. Where is the talk of free
    markets? Republicans can use Obamacare as an opportunity to talk about how the
    free market can deliver better and more affordable healthcare than anything government
    can craft. We have Republicans in Jefferson City (I gave up on DC a long time
    ago and put my hope in Missouri knowing it would be easier to stand against the
    Feds through the MOGA.) who believe they can manage better than the Democrats.
    Now that they are in control, they don't talk about free market solutions, liberty
    solutions, doing only what civil government should do and leave the rest up to
    the people. They just believe they can spend our money better than the Democrats
    did.\r\n&ldquo;job creation ahead of special interests&rdquo; &ndash; I hate it
    when a Republican talks about job creation because for the most part &ndash; that
    means crony capitalism or protectionism at work. The typical Republican has no
    understanding of the free market. They believe that it is up to the government
    to create jobs. It is not.\r\nReforming welfare &ndash; another belief by the
    typical Republican. Civil government can never be a source of &ldquo;welfare.&rdquo;
    We need individuals who understand this and are willing to educate the people
    as they go that they have a plan to get the civil government out of this failed
    welfare system and return it to the people &ndash; the families and the churches
    and private charities. \r\n&ldquo;America&rsquo;s public schools should be the
    best in the world.&rdquo; Now that is profound. Does he understand how hard it
    will be to get past the educrats to true public schools and not government run
    schools. Is he prepared to fight that fight? Does he have a plan?\r\nEric Greitens
    statement is so typical of most Republicans, even a new Republican. I am looking
    for a Republican candidate who understands what the role of civil government is,
    be willing to put forth a plan with the end goal being free market and liberty
    and civil government is in its proper role. (Yes, even I understand that we can&rsquo;t
    get there quickly. Believe it or not, I am willing to go with &ldquo;reforms&rdquo;
    if the goal is right.) We need a candidate who has the grit to fight the fight
    with the educrats, the bureaucrats, the special interests &ndash; maybe enemies
    of liberty that even an experienced member of the military hasn&rsquo;t experience.
    My gripe isn&rsquo;t with Eric Greitens. As a new Republican he is just one of
    many typical Republicans. We need a different type of Republican, to lead us out
    of this mess in Missouri."

  content: Senator John Lamping sent you a link to this Fox News story about Eric
    Greitens being a Democrat. Funny, when I ran for State Senate against Ryan McKenna
    the Republican Party cut a deal with McKenna and Lamping. The Republican Party
    would not help me out and the Democrats would not help with Lamping's opponent.
    I lost by a couple thousand votes and Lamping won his election. So much for being
    team players.

<p>Were you shocked when you learned that Navy SEAL, author, humanitarian, and charity founder, Eric Greitens, was born and raised and voted Democrat?</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;d heard the rumors. The whispers spread by some Republican campaign operatives. But I&rsquo;ve learned to trust those campaign operatives about as far as I fund the national debt.</p>
<p>Then, Senator John Lamping sent me a link to this Fox News story:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/13/former-navy-seal-why-am-no-longer-democrat.html">Former Navy SEAL: Why I am no longer a Democrat</a></h3>
<p>So, the rumors were true. Eric Greitens <em>was</em> a Democrat.</p>
<p>Obviously, I read all of his confession.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was raised as a Democrat. I was taught that Harry Truman was the greatest president ever because he was strong, stood up to the communists, and most important, he was from Missouri. I was taught to stand up for the little guy, and that bigger government was the best way to do that.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the worst was yet to come.</p>
<blockquote><p>I registered to vote as a Democrat, and several years ago some Democrats even tried to recruit me to run for Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shocked?</p>
<p>Reading Greitens&rsquo;s words on Fox News, I realized that this story will likely shatter some people&rsquo;s faith. How could it not?</p>
<p>Imagine growing up in the Millennial era, born after about 1981. By the time you started paying attention to things like politics, Bill Clinton was President. The federal budget was balanced. Unemployment was impossibly low. Ordinary people were building McMansions with oversized garages for wintering their express cruisers. Peace and prosperity abound. Two interns in every pot.</p>
<p>Your mom and dad might have been Republicans or Democrats, but all your favorite teachers were Democrats. So were the cool kids. And they all sort of laughed at the few geeky kids who admitted they were Republicans. Or, funnier still, conservatives.</p>
<p>Then, of course, came George W. Bush and, like, thank GOD you told everyone you were a Democrat. I mean, ya know. Right?</p>
<p>Now, you read <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/13/former-navy-seal-why-am-no-longer-democrat.html">this</a>. A guy who&rsquo;s like the Avengers version of every good quality you were raised to admire writes, &ldquo;I am a conservative Republican, but I didn&rsquo;t start out that way."</p>
<p>Wa-Huutt?</p>
<p>You google this dude and everything SCREAMS Democrat. He went to Rwanda and Croatia to help the people Republicans hate, right? And he worked with homeless kids in Bolivia. And with Mother Teresa. And then he turned down a bunch of money from hedge funds and investment banks to start a charity. Does that sound Republican to you?</p>
<p>I mean, sure, he was a Navy SEAL and all. And he was a championship boxer in England, too. But he was a Rhodes Scholar with degrees in philosophy.</p>
<p>How could a role model be a . . . Republican? And call himself a conservative?</p>
<p>OMG! What if I&rsquo;m . . .?</p>
<p>You read on, hoping that whatever turned this Greitens dude Republican doesn&rsquo;t infect you.</p>
<blockquote><p>As I got older, I no longer believed in their ideas. Even worse, I had concluded that liberals aren&rsquo;t just wrong. All too often they are world-class hypocrites. They talk a great game about helping the most vulnerable, with ideas that feel good and fashionable. The problem is their ideas don&rsquo;t work, and often hurt the exact people they claim to help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Weird. Still talking about helping people. (I thought he was a Republican?)</p>
<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not that I doubted their intentions. But good intentions are easy. Even easier when you&rsquo;re spending other people&rsquo;s money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay. That sounds pretty Republican.</p>
<blockquote><p>I became a conservative because I believe that caring for people means more than just spending taxpayer money; it means delivering results. It means respecting and challenging our citizens, telling them what they need to hear, not simply what they want to hear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, duh. Of course, caring for people means results. Like how many Facebook likes you get, right?</p>
<blockquote><p>I was raised to stand up for the little guy, for working families and the middle class. I am committed to that principle today more than ever. And if I thought the Democratic Party had the right ideas to do that, I&rsquo;d still be one of them. But they don&rsquo;t. And if I trusted career politicians to fix the problems they created, I&rsquo;d still be standing on the sidelines. But I don&rsquo;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Eric Greitens lost faith&mdash;in the Democratic Party, in liberalism, and in career politicians. Because each of those had a heavy hand in creating the very problems he recognizes need fixing before his kids get old enough to deal with them.</p>
<p>At this point, <strong>some people&rsquo;s faith will shatter</strong>. Not the faith of people who&rsquo;ve been praying for a leader like Eric Greitens&mdash;but the faith of people who blindly followed the mob into the great abyss of liberal &ldquo;caring&rdquo; and establishment selfishness.</p>
<p>I believe <strong>Greitens's testimony will shatter some lifelong Democrats' faith in their party.</strong> It will shatter some casual voters' faith in selecting the "lesser of two evils." Eric Greitens will shatter the revolving door through which the parties rotate to advance their interests and their friend's interests at the expense of good government.</p>
<p>I am reminded that Ronald Reagan was a Democrat until he delivered his famous speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/timechoosing.html">A Time For Choosing</a>.&rdquo; In his opening remarks, Reagan said, "I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course."</p>
<p>Reagan was born in 1911; he was 53 when he converted. Eric Grietens needed only about 40 years to reach the same conclusion as the Gipper. (Maybe all that book learnin&rsquo; did Eric some good after all.)</p>
<p>Some of us &ldquo;cradle conservatives&rdquo; might question Greitens&rsquo; bonafides. That&rsquo;s fine. I suggest they find someone who served with Greitens&mdash;in Rwanda, in Croatia, in Iraq, or anywhere he&rsquo;s served his country and his fellow man. Ask those who&rsquo;ve been in the line of fire if Greitens has the steel to carry through on his mission.</p>
<p>And what is that mission?</p>
<blockquote><p>So what would I do? I believe in limited but effective government. I believe in replacing ObamaCare with something that actually works. I believe in putting working families and job creation ahead of special interests. I believe that in a free society we have to defend religious liberties and the 2nd Amendment, and protect innocent life, so everyone has the freedom to pursue happiness. I believe in reforming welfare, so every person can have a chance at a life of dignity, purpose, and meaning. And I believe America&rsquo;s public schools should be the best in the world</p>
<p>In other words, I believe we have a lot of work to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not a long list but people with long agenda seem never to get around to accomplishing the first item. Ronald Reagan came to office with an even shorter list: fix the economy, shrink the government, and restore respect for America around the world.</p>
<p>As for me, my faith in the political establishment was shattered long ago. I&rsquo;ve had too many career politicians lie to my face about matters both specific and general. (You know who you are.) I&rsquo;ve seen career politicians seduce and corrupt wide-eyed activists with promises of access to famous people and campaign jobs.</p>
<p>My faith in government was shattered when I realized the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/09/the-war-on-poverty-after-50-years">war on poverty has taken $22 trillion out of the economy</a> and into Washington&mdash;the spoils of war distributed between academics, bureaucrats, and crony capitalists while poor neighborhoods deteriorated, poor families lost whatever pride they once had, and "caring" became synonymous with handouts to "keep the rabble quiet."</p>
<p>Something's gotta break.</p>
<p>I hope <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/13/former-navy-seal-why-am-no-longer-democrat.html">Eric Greitens&rsquo;s op-ed on Fox News</a> shatters some people&rsquo;s faith. We need some converts. We need some reinvigorated cradle conservatives. And we need a leader whose entire life is defined by action and results, not promises and excuses.</p>
<p>We need a leader whose actions speak for him.</p>
<p>We need a leader whose actions say simply, &ldquo;follow me."</p>
