  content: Well, you should expect it when the people voted for Hussein Obama, an
    EVIL little man, who supports late term partial-birth abortion and infanticide.

  content: "It is evil, and I wouldn't even blame Angela if she were mad that I brought
    it to her attention. In a day when the evil spewing from the left is rapid fire,
    news as heinous and disgusting as this feels insulting. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest
    insult comes in Gawker's attempt to whitewash the entire matter and say it didn't
    happen, and that conservatives are blowing it all out of proportion.  \r\n\r\nWe
    aren't. \r\n\r\nYou can't un-hear what that so-called Dr. said.  This has reached
    back and partnered with Mengele.  \r\n\r\nSanger would be proud.  Hell, Hitler
    would be! \r\n\r\nI would go one step further, Bill.  I would say this isn't just
    evil.  This is a whole new day in Evil. \r\n\r\nThanks for your story. Please
    tell Angela I'm sorry."

<p>Today was a particularly busy day for me.</p>
<p>I had a series of meetings. Like every hour, another meeting. From 9:00 on.</p>
<p>I saw the text from my wife.&nbsp;<img class=" size-full wp-image-16187 aligncenter" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-18.51.07.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 18.51.07" width="434" height="155" /></p>
<p>I didn't have time to click on a video. I was in a room full of people. Important business. Major client and all that. And I completely misunderstood the "H/T Gina L." thing. For some reason, I thought Angela was mad at Gina. (There's a cool psychological explanation for my misunderstanding, but that's for another post. Unless Dr. Gina wants to explain it in the comments.) Anyway, I didn't have time to deal with it. Which makes me feel like a jerk, because Angela's sick. But I am kind of a jerk.</p>
<p>Later, Angela texted this:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16188" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-18.56.06.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 18.56.06" width="311" height="64" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay. At this point I had no clue the Jindal text&nbsp;related to the Gina Loudon&nbsp;text. But I'm slow. Always have been.</p>
<p>By the time I got home, Angela and I had been texting about other stuff so long I'd forgotten about the Gina Loudon text. So I looked. Here's the video:</p>

<p>There you have it. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-honors-secretary-state-hillary-rodham-clinton-her-commitment-womens-health-c" target="_blank">The organization that Hillary Clinton is proud to have funding her campaign</a> kills babies and sells the livers and hearts and lungs for a profit--that goes back to Hillary 2016.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/14/video-planned-parenthoods-profit-off-of-fetal-body-parts/" target="_blank">Sick</a>. Evil woman. No reason to sugarcoat. Meet Dr. Deborah&nbsp;Nucatola.</p>

<p><strong>Raw, naked evil served straight up with fava beans and a nice Chianti.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The modern Democratic Party and its BFFs like Planned Parenthood seem more suited for 1930s Europe than 21st Century North America.</p>
<p>Not just wrong--evil.</p>
<p>Sorry if I ruined your dinner, but this seemed important.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Planned Parenthood releases a statement. I agree with HotAir:&nbsp;<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/14/planned-parenthood-responds-nucatolas-just-talking-about-reimbursements/" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood is lying</a>.</p>
