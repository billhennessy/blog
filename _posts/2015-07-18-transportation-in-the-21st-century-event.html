<blockquote>You can't get there from here.</p></blockquote>
<p>The way people get from here to there--and how they pay for the privilege--is about to change. We want you to have a say in the future of transportation.</p>
<p>To help, Heritage Action for America is teaming up with St. Louis Tea Party Coalition to put on a Transportation Empowerment night on Saturday, July 25, 2015 at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Speakers Include:</p>
<p>[gallery ids="16213,16214,16215"]</p>
<ul>
<li>State Rep. Paul Curtman</li>
<li>Ryan Johnson, President, Missouri Alliance for Freedom</li>
<li>Ben Evans, Heritage Action for America</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn about initiatives like the Transportation Empowerment Act that would keep federal gas taxes in the states where they're paid.</p>
<p>Refreshments from McArthur's Bakery provided by Heritage Action.</p>
<p>RSVP:<br />
