  content: "Trump is a person who speak plain and colorful, but if you listen carefully
    to what he says, he is the only candidate who speak the truth on the urgent issues
    which  our nation is facing now. Without smarts, know how, negotiating skills
    and knowledge on everything, nobody can build multi billion dollar company like
    he did. He is the kind of leader we need at this point of our nation after so
    many years of unconfident and dishonest leaders ruining our reputation and losing
    respect and trust from the world. \r\nHe speak with no fear and he exibit the
    confidence we need to see in our president. We missed it for so long."

  content: "I&rsquo;m a veteran and I will outright say Trump was 100% correct that
    McCain was no war hero! Fact is, he was a TRAITOR to America and many service
    members lost their lives due to his cowardice. There is numerous documentation
    to prove that his awards: Silver Star, a Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze
    Stars, two Commendation medals plus two Purple Hearts are all as fraudulent as
    McCain himself! \r\n\r\nLets start with the fact that one must ask how on a medal
    count basis that McCain outweighs Murphy and Glenn, who both for years repeatedly
    performed extraordinary deeds on the ground or in the air against an armed enemy.
    \r\nMcCain&rsquo;s valor awards are based on speculation as to what happened in
    1967 during his 23d mission, when over Vietnam he was shot down and injured. He
    was then captured and then spent the next 5.5 years selling out America!\r\nIs
    it no wonder that his own Senate office refuses to provide copies of the narratives
    for each medal. None of the awards, less the DFC, were for heroism! His awards
    were in-fact &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; meaning they were given no questions asked
    for all prisoners at the time period for that camp. \r\n\r\nMcCain&rsquo;s Silver
    Star narrative for the period 27 October 1967 the day after he was shot down to
    8 December 1968 reads: &ldquo;His captors&hellip; subjected him to extreme mental
    and physical cruelties in an attempt to obtain military information and false
    confessions for propaganda purposes. Through his resistance to those brutalities,
    he contributed significantly towards the eventual abandonment&hellip;&rdquo; of
    such harsh treatment by the North Vietnamese. \r\nHowever, in McCain&rsquo;s own
    words just four days after being captured, he admitted that he violated the U.S.
    Code of Conduct by telling his captors &ldquo;O.K, I&rsquo;ll give you military
    information if you will take me to the hospital.&rdquo; \r\nThus, in truth &ldquo;He
    received the nation&rsquo;s third highest award, the Silver Star, for treason
    as he provided aid and comfort to the enemy!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe rest of his valor
    awards issued automatically every year while he was a POW read much like the Silver
    Star. More boilerplate often repeating the exact same words. An example: &ldquo;By
    his heroic endeavors, exceptional skill, and devotion to duty, he reflected great
    credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Naval Service and
    the United States Armed Forces.&rdquo; As we can see no specific of any valor
    was entailed!\r\n\r\nThe truth is that by the fourth day of his capture he signed
    a confession and declared himself a &ldquo;black criminal who performed deeds
    of an air pirate.&rdquo; This statement and other interviews he gave to the Communist
    press were then used as propaganda to fan the flames of the antiwar movement.
    In total McCain made over 30 of these propaganda videos for the Communist Press.
    \r\n\r\nAccording to McCain he tells of horror he endured: relentlessly beatings,
    torture, broken limbs. All inflicted during savage interrogations. Yet no other
    POW was a witness to these accounts. JUST NOT BELIEVABLE, unless we are to believe
    that McCain was kept in an isolated prison cell away from all other prisoners!\r\n\r\nA
    former POW stated &ldquo;No man witnessed another man during interrogations&hellip;
    We relied on each other to tell the truth when a man was returned to his cell.&rdquo;
    However, if the torture was as bad as McCain stated his physical state would have
    clearly been noted!\r\n\r\nLet us not also mention the fact that according to
    those issuing the awards, two eyewitnesses are required for any award of heroism.
    However, NONE of the valor awards McCain received have or had any eyewitnesses,
    less himself and his captors.\r\n\r\nCould it be that his awards were issued on
    the fact that his father and grandfather both held 4 star admiral positions with
    the Navy? One can only assume that this is the truth, as from day 4 on of his
    captivity he behaved as a COLLABORATOR and propaganda tool for his North Vietnamese
    captors. McCain had engaged in no less than 30, and likely as many as 38 anti-American
    propaganda broadcasts for Radio Hanoi during the period of his captivity. Does
    any of this speak to being an image of an American WAR HERO? \r\n\r\nAn example
    of his cowardice and TREASON against America can be found in the US NEWS &amp;
    WORLD REPORT, where he personally admitted in the article that during the time
    he was in prison (in fact It was by the fourth day) he asked the [North] Vietnamese
    to take him to the hospital and that in exchange he promised he would provide
    them with classified military information. \r\n\r\nThis military information consisted
    of highly classified information, the most important of which was the &ldquo;package
    route&rdquo; the military was using for the bombing of North Vietnam. He provided
    in detail the altitudes, directions, and the primary targets of interest for the
    United States.\r\n\r\nThe result was that the North Vietnamese moved their anti-aircraft
    defenses into those areas and built them up and strengthened them. They also moved
    the rockets, aircraft weapons, into the &ldquo;package route&rdquo; of where the
    airplanes were flying. This ended in many lost lives, as supported by intelligence
    reports! This information provided by this traitor ended with a 60% increase of
    lost aircraft and military personnel (Yes, lives were lost because of this coward!)
    After about a month, the situation deteriorated to the point that they finally
    called off the bombing of North Vietnam, all due to the information that McCain
    had given to the enemy!\r\n\r\nIt is said that McCain refused an early release.
    An act of valor? \r\n\r\nThis has clearly been disputed by three former POWs who
    stated that McCain was ordered to turn it down by his U.S. POW commander and he
    &ldquo;just followed orders.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nMcCain&rsquo;s actions in Vietnam
    dishonor the many POWs who stood tall and refused to break their honor code. \r\n\r\nU.S.
    MILITARY CODE OF CONDUCT \r\n\r\nI. I am an American, fighting in the forces which
    guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense.
    \r\n\r\nII. I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will
    never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist.
    \r\n\r\nIII. If I am captured I will continue to resist by all means available.
    I will make every effort to escape and to aid others to escape. I will accept
    neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. \r\n\r\nIV. If I become a prisoner
    of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information
    or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior,
    I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed
    over me and will back them up in every way. \r\n\r\nV. When questioned, should
    I become a prisoner of war, I am bound to only give name, rank, service number,
    and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my
    ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and
    its allies or harmful to their cause. \r\n\r\nVI. I will never forget that I am
    an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to
    the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United
    States of America. \r\nSo should Trump not have stated the truth? \r\n\r\nI say
    Trump was right on point and that maybe we should have a poll by Americans as
    who is the biggest liar in government? McCain, Pelosi, Hillary, Boehner, McConnell,
    Reid, and let us not forget Obama or is it Barry ,,,, no one will ever know because
    the News Media refused to Vett him! News media vetting means pointing by the Media
    to the birth certificate on the government website, despite this proven a fake/forgery
    and even Barry&rsquo;s own lawyer calling it such a bad fake (in a court of law).
    \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF LIARS IN THE CONGRESS AND SENATE!
    THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES REFUSING TO TAKE A STAND
    AND SHOW BOTH INTEGRITY AND MORALS IN THEIR DECISIONS, INSTEAD OF MAKING DECISIONS
    ON BY THE FACT OF WHO WILL GIVE THEM THE MOST MONEY!\r\nSOLUTION: NO MONEY ALLOWED
    IN POLITICS OR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMAN RECEIVE NO PAY FROM TAX PAYERS AS THEY
    REFUSE TO REPRESENT TAX PAYERS! THESE CRIMINALS WHO HAVE NO INTEGRITY CAN ACCEPT
    THE MONEY FROM THE LOBBYISTS OR THEIR BASE (TAX PAYERS) BUT NOT BOTH AS THAT SHOULD
    BE CONSIDERED DOUBLE DIPPING!"
