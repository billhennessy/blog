<p>The US Navy did far more for me than I did for the Navy.</p>
<p>I was a better person the day I left active duty than I am today. But I&rsquo;m better today than I would have been had I not served.</p>
<p>I wrote a 5-part series of posts on the need for a new service ethos in America. This idea isn&rsquo;t mine. William F. Buckley wrote about the need in&nbsp;<em>Four Reforms</em>&nbsp;(1974) and in&nbsp;<em>Gratitude</em>&nbsp;(1990). Eric Greitens, Navy SEAL, humanitarian, Rhodes Scholar, charity founder, has promoted service his whole life. I simply echo their great ideas.</p>
