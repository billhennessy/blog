<p>The Holy See is in Rome.<br />The Empty See is in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Taxicab Commission (MTC) is a racket to protect incumbent taxicab companies. They use their power to keep St. Louis in the stone age of transportation.</p>
<p><a href="http://duanelester.com/2015/07/29/coward-st-louis-metropolitan-taxicab-commission-delays-vote-on-uber/" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s time to dissolve the MTC</a>. It has served its purpose and outlived its usefulness. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/07/05/st-louis-uber-nada/">Like the riverboat commission of the 1850s</a>.</p>
<p>Until then, I will do everything in my power to avoid taxis in St. Louis, and to keep my visiting clients away from taxis. I will pick them up at the airport and drive them wherever they need to go.</p>
