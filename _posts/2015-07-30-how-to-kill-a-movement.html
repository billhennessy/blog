  content: "Well, Bill, I for one certainly came out of 2012 extremely battered and
    disillusioned, and I just decided that there was definitely far more duplicity,
    consolidation of power and influence-peddling in national politics for me to really
    ever make a difference in that arena, and quite possibly the same was true of
    state politics.  So I'm focusing on the local level, and trying to politically
    evangelize for liberty and good governance one-on-one.  \r\n\r\nI don't pretend
    to know to what particular situation(s) you refer, but I certainly appreciate
    that by now Paul Curtman has been put under enormous pressure to capitulate from
    multiple sources in multiple ways.  That's absolutely a given.  Has he withstood
    the pressure better than anyone?  I can't say."

  content: "You're right. Others, too, withstand the temptations. I've observed Paul,
    though, and he would be a prize for the forces of elitism. \n\nDrives me nuts
    when people make perfect the enemy of better. Even nutser when they don't even
    know what they're talking about, just batting at buzz words. \n\nThanks for reading
    and for sharing your story."

  content: Hard line conservatives teach in their seminars that if your advocate doesn't
    do all you expect of him, you must dump him and find another.  I don't believe
    in that extreme tactic, and that is why I have quit that group and their ilk...
    I learned a long time ago (when I was a City Councilman) that you cannot always
    garner the support you need to pass a certain piece of legislation. According
    to Robert's Rules of Order, one can only bring up an item for reconsideration
    if he votes with the majority. SO, sometimes one must vote with the majority even
    when they are in opposition to be able to be in a position to make a motion for
    reconsideration. So, one does not always do what you think they should do for
    other reasons. Find out why before you pull your support.

  content: "Muleman,\n\nI love the line \"if your advocate doesn't do all you expect
    of him . . .\" \n\nThat's a big problem, because people of very similar political
    views have wildly differing expectations. The biggest difference involves what
    we mean by winning. To some, winning means a complete overthrow of the status
    quo. To others, winning is measurable improvements in key area. \n\nHistory shows
    that overthrows are short-lived. The French Revolution was a radical overthrow
    of the status quo, and it kicked off a century of turmoil that stifled social
    progress. The American Revolution was far more gradual. The colonies had been
    drifting free from England (and Spain and France) for a century. \n\nCombine the
    need some have for immediately 180-degree reversals with a narrow view of what
    constitutes conservative orthodoxy, and you get a movement more interested in
    being \"right\" than in winning. Or, <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/2009/05/27/reagan-revisionism-do-you-like-the-new-deal-or-dont-you/\"
    target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">as Sean Scallon writes in The American Conservative</a>,
    we aim for 39% instead of 51% at the polls. \n\nThanks for writing."

  content: I know who they are and I am aware. It's practically PC from the right
    including the judgmental "aha"'s of "trigger words". It's truly unfortunate. It
    is forgotten how progressives took words already out there and transformed their
    meaning.

  content: "Isn't it so wonderful there is someone ...Trump _ who is free to speak
    and  do as he sees fit to make our America great again without being concerned
    with interest group's demand ? We are facing unique challenges to recover our
    pride, dignity, resources and undeniable American spirits which have been destroyed
    \ under the tatally wrong and inadequate leadership in the past some years.  We
    need a unique leader with a unique ability to mend all the wrongs done to our
    nation....that's Trump.\r\nHis remark, \" country without border is not a country
    \"...how true it is...\r\nStrong military ( peace with strength ), Mastering the
    \" Art of Deal \" ( especially dealing with clever leaders of China and Russia
    ) and ect.....I just know only Trump can achieve them with confidence for our
    country."

<p>Did you ever see a movement grow?</p>
<p>Did you see the way it starts?</p>
<p>Did you feel it spread around you?</p>
<p>Did you hear it rustling the leaves and scraping the sidewalk?</p>
<p>Did you want to kill it?</p>
<p>The weird thing about movements is that opposition tends to strengthen them. Movements feed on hostility the way rats feed on garbage.</p>
<p>The way you kill a movement is infiltration and fragmentation.</p>
<p>You can't kill a movement from the outside. You can only kill it from inside. The way&nbsp;an antibiotic kills bacteria.</p>
<p>I'm watching it happen in Missouri. Not intentionally. In fact, the frackers (those who fracture) truly believe they're <em>strengthening</em> the movement by eliminating&nbsp;suspicious elements.</p>
<p>I'm one of those suspicious elements. They're probably better off without me. But they've also seized on Rep. Paul Curtman as a suspicious element.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Paul Curtman is about the truest conservative in Jefferson City. He's brilliantly navigated the state capitol without falling prey to the establishment. He's taken hard lines on hard issues, consistent with his remarkably strong Christian conservative ethic.</p>
<p>And a tiny but angry and relentless element of Missouri conservatism wants to isolate, personalize, and attack Paul. They believe Paul has strayed because he didn't get everything they want all at once. You know, the way toddlers expect their wishes&nbsp;to happen.</p>
<p>This is fragmentation. It's fracturing. It's destructive.</p>
<p>It's the only way to kill a movement. And it's completely homegrown.</p>
<p>The greatest threat to freedom is not a totalitarian; the greatest threat to freedom is a conservative who can't tolerate deviations from her narrow agenda.</p>
<p>Just cool down folks. We might win this thing.</p>
