<p>Are you tired of being angry?</p>
<p>Did you know that a lot of other people are tired of your anger?</p>
<p>Did you know that 70 percent of Americans don&rsquo;t like politics?</p>
<p>Did you know that the 70 percent of Americans who don&rsquo;t like politics won&rsquo;t vote for anything an angry person tells them to vote for?</p>
<p>Go look it up. It&rsquo;s totally true.</p>
<p>So many conservatives want another Reagan, but they want an angry, vengeful, belligerent Reagan. They don&rsquo;t want the real Ronal Reagan, the Gipper, the Happy Warrior. They want the Terminator.</p>
<p>But the pursuadable voters who hate politics hate&nbsp;Terminators. They like Gippers.</p>
<p>Senator Jim Lembke posted a brilliant bit of leadership on Facebook last night:</p>
<blockquote><p>My pastor shared with me recently that that he is limiting his facebook time because all the negative post relating to our country and culture. This made me think. Why are we as Christians, why are we as conservatives often so negative about the state of things. I think it is because we realize how God has blessed our country. We realize the wonderful legacy left to us by our founding fathers. We love our families, neighbors and communities. We want all to prosper and enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Maybe we should start taking a page out of the playbook of Ronald Reagan and address the hope, love and desire we have for all our fellow Americans to prosper.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Jim. We needed that. I needed that. I&rsquo;m pissed that I&rsquo;m pissed so much, and it&rsquo;s all my fault.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one who decides how I react to circumstances. I don&rsquo;t read Viktr Frankl&rsquo;s <em>Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning</em> often enough. (If you&rsquo;ve never read <em> Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning</em>, you haven&rsquo;t started living.) I need to read it once a month. (It&rsquo;s a short book.)</p>
<p>Leadership isn&rsquo;t flaming the rage people feel. Leadership is giving people something to do. Inspiring action that makes lives better. That pursues happiness, defends life, and advances liberty.</p>
<p>Millennials will be the largest voting generation in Missouri in 2016. They&rsquo;re young. They&rsquo;re not old enough to vote fear and anger. They&rsquo;re still voting hope and happiness.</p>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t give them hope and happiness, someone else will.</p>
<p>And if we offer fear and anger and Millennials vote the other way, I will understand completely.</p>
