<p>Conservatism blesses the world.</p>
<p>Our principles <strong>dignify people</strong> with work that<strong> produces value</strong>. We leave them <strong>free to pursue happiness</strong>, which includes their work, their leisure, their learning, and their families.</p>
<p>Our cause is <strong>moral and spiritual</strong>, not economic. We want everyone to <strong>experience and benefit from meaningful work</strong> because work provides people with self-esteem and satisfaction. Work is not punishment; it's a blessing.</p>
<p>We do oppose things, but only those things that threaten to degrade human beings by denying them the dignity and benefits of working and living their own lives.</p>
<p>We advance <strong>principles that undeniably improve human lives</strong>. Economics, politics, finance, and culture issues are only tools and measures of our quest to liberate people to live the best lives they can.</p>
<p>What we do is <strong>noble and virtuous</strong>. We should all remind ourselves every day that the work we do lifts up humanity. Not many people can say that.</p>
<p>As you begin to relax this weekend remember that you have done work that improved real human lives. And if no one else thanks you, I will.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong>.</p>
