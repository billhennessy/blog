  content: "Thanks for the update. \n\nBut for clarification, what's the difference
    between looting, on one hand, and 12 people using the cover of a protest to break
    into a store and steal, on the other hand?"

  content: Do you blame shoppers for shoplifting? It would be impossible to shoplift
    if it wasn't for all those shoppers providing cover. Personally, I place more
    importance on people exercising their constitutional rights to speech and assembly
    than going to Walmart for a pack of toilet paper or a case of beer.

  content: Nick, I hope my question in the comments didn't come off wrong. I, too,
    draw a bright line between protestors and vandals.  The previous commenter seemed
    to imply that a break-in isn't looting. I think of looting as stealing under the
    cover of distraction--war, natural disaster, etc. As opposed to breaking and entering
    without the cover of some big attention-getter.
