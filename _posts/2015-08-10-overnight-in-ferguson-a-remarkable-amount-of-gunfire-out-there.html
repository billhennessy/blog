<p>St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters "there was a remarkable amount of gunfire out there," describing the scene on W. Florissant last night.</p>
<p>A shooter confronted plain-clothes officers and opened fire. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect is in critical, unstable condition in a local hospital. One officer was treated, but the severity and cause of his injury is unknown.</p>
<p>The shooting and at least one break-in of a business marred what had been peaceful commemorations of the death of Michael Brown.</p>
<p>Here's video of the initial shooting:</p>

<p>Several stores were robbed earlier in the evening. Fox2News reported that 911 Hair Salon was one of the shops, but I've since learned that report may have been incorrect. According to Twitter, St. Louis Alderman Antonio French stationed himself in front of 911 Hair Salon.</p>
