<p>If you're still asking "why bother?" <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/08/09/why-bother/">read this</a>.</p>
<p>If you still believe conservatism is an economic theory, <a href="http://wp.me/p3daxv-4jc">read this</a>.</p>
<p>If you're ready to [olympus_highlight color="yellow"]create a transformational social movement that improves lives[/olympus_highlight] by providing every America with the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to pursue happiness, watch this video. It's Simon Sinek's TEDx talk about his then-new book, <a href="http://amzn.to/1N8s7pK" target="_blank">Start With Why</a>, and it's the most powerful idea I've discovered in recent years.</p>

<p>This is exactly what Arthur C. Brooks talks about in The Conservative Heart. [olympus_highlight color="yellow"]People don't buy what you make; they buy why you make it[/olympus_highlight].</p>
<p>If this video seemed familiar, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2010/08/09/live-your-why/">I've blogged about it before</a>.</p>
<p>My readers love your comments. Please leave your thoughts&nbsp;here [olympus_icon type="fa-hand-o-down"]</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
