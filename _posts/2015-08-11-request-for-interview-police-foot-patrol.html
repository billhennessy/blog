<p>If you have walked a neighborhood foot beat as a police officer, I'd like to talk to you.</p>
<p>I am working on a story on policing, and I would like to hear stories from men and women who have both walked neighborhoods as police officers and driven patrols in cruisers.</p>
<p>If interested, please contact me with this form:</p>
