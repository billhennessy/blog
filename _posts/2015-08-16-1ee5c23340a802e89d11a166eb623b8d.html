<p>Hi Bill,<br />
Katie Spee and Lane Watkins in Florida just introduced me to your work.<br />
Your message that we need to change the focus of our comments if we are to win the minds of community members is exactly the cause I follow.  Thanks for saying it so well.<br />
Yes, I do believe our country can be OK, even at this late stage, if we open the eyes of enough Americans to the personal impacts of current policies. We do not need to talk about left and right, R and  D.   Talk about working together to find the real problems so we can produce effective solutions. </p>
<p>After 25 years of helping mid-cap companies prosper, I can honestly say, diversity never built group success.  The key is unity.  We must pull informed people together and force polticians to vote our way or send them home.  Thanks for your work.  John A.<br />
