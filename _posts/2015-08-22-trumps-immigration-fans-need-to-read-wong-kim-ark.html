  content: "Do you believe the framers of the 14th Amendment meant to give power and
    authority to illegal aliens to bestow US citizenship on the birth of their child
    simply by having the baby on U.S. soil? I think not. As for the case of Wong Kim
    Ark, the Court ruled that a child born in the U.S. of legal aliens, (not illegal
    aliens) was entitled to &ldquo;birthright citizenship.&rdquo; Same is true to
    legal U.S. citizens who have a child born outside the states. That child is a
    U.S. citizen, as is the case with John McCain, who was born in Panama to parents
    who were U.S. citizens. So, I believe it is not settled law.\r\nBesides, the Supreme
    Court is not infallible. They have ruled incorrectly many times. They incorrectly
    legislated from the bench in their most recent decisions on ObamaCare and Gay
    Marriage to name a few.  \r\nSo, there is no need to amend the Constitution with
    Article 5 when  Article 1 Section 8 Clause 4 gives Congress the authority over
    naturalization of people. If need be, Congress would only need to pass a bill
    or a resolution clarifying the intent of the framers of the 14th Amendment. Precedent
    has been set when Congress passed The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, wherein,
    it bestowed citizenship on all Native Americans born within the territorial limits
    of the country. Will Congress be able to pass such legislation remains to be seen,
    but that is not to say it cannot happen."

    FONT SIZEAA by EDWARD J. ERLER August 19, 2015 4:00 AM \r\nDonald Trump continues
    to bewilder political experts. He unabashedly wades into politically dangerous
    territory and yet continues to be rewarded by favorable poll results. He has clearly
    tapped into a reserve of public resentment for inside-the-Beltway politics. How
    far this resentment will carry him is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but the Republican
    establishment is worried. His latest proposal to end birthright citizenship has
    set off alarm bells in the Republican party. The leadership worries that Trump
    will derail the party&rsquo;s plans to appeal to the Latino vote. Establishment
    Republicans believe that the future of the party depends on being able to capture
    a larger share of this rapidly expanding electorate. Trump&rsquo;s plan, however,
    may appeal to the most rapidly expanding electorate, senior citizens, and may
    have an even greater appeal to the millions of Republicans who stayed away from
    the polls in 2012 as well as the ethnic and blue-collar Democrats who crossed
    party lines to vote Republican in the congressional elections of 2014. All of
    these voters outnumber any increase in the Latino vote that Republicans could
    possibly hope to gain from a population that has consistently voted Democratic
    by a two-thirds majority and shows little inclination to change. RELATED: Not
    Hard to Read the 14th Amendment As Not Requiring Birthright Citizenship &mdash;
    And Nothing Odd About Supporting Such a Reading Critics say that Trump&rsquo;s
    plan is unrealistic, that it would require a constitutional amendment because
    the 14th Amendment mandates birthright citizenship and that the Supreme Court
    has upheld this requirement ever since its passage in 1868. The critics are wrong.
    A correct understanding of the intent of the framers of the 14th Amendment and
    legislation passed by Congress in the late 19th century and in 1923 extending
    citizenship to American Indians provide ample proof that Congress has constitutional
    power to define who is within the &ldquo;jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo;
    and therefore eligible for citizenship. Simple legislation passed by Congress
    and signed by the president would be constitutional under the 14th Amendment.
    Birthright citizenship is the policy whereby the children of illegal aliens born
    within the geographical limits of the U.S. are entitled to American citizenship
    &mdash; and, as Trump says, it is a great magnet for illegal immigration. Many
    of Trump&rsquo;s critics believe that this policy is an explicit command of the
    Constitution, consistent with the British common-law system. This is simply not
    true. Congress has constitutional power to define who is within the &ldquo;jurisdiction
    of the United States&rdquo; and therefore eligible for citizenship. Although the
    Constitution of 1787 mentioned citizens, it did not define citizenship. It was
    in 1868 that a definition of citizenship entered the Constitution with the ratification
    of the 14th Amendment. Here is the familiar language: &ldquo;All persons born
    or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
    citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&rdquo; Thus
    there are two components to American citizenship: birth or naturalization in the
    U.S. and being subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Today, we somehow have
    come to believe that anyone born within the geographical limits of the U.S. is
    automatically subject to its jurisdiction; but this renders the jurisdiction clause
    utterly superfluous. If this had been the intention of the framers of the 14th
    Amendment, presumably they would have said simply that all persons born or naturalized
    in the U.S. are thereby citizens. Indeed, during debate over the amendment, Senator
    Jacob Howard, the author of the citizenship clause, attempted to assure skeptical
    colleagues that the language was not intended to make Indians citizens of the
    United States. Indians, Howard conceded, were born within the nation&rsquo;s geographical
    limits, but he steadfastly maintained that they were not subject to its jurisdiction
    because they owed allegiance to their tribes and not to the U.S. Senator Lyman
    Trumbull, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, supported this view, arguing
    that &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&rdquo; meant &ldquo;not owing
    allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of the
    United States.&rdquo; RELATED: End Birthright Citizenship Now: Barack Obama Makes
    the Case Jurisdiction understood as allegiance, Senator Howard explained, excludes
    not only Indians but &ldquo;persons born in the United States who are foreigners,
    aliens, [or] who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&rdquo;
    Thus, &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction&rdquo; does not simply mean, as is commonly
    thought today, subject to American laws or courts. It means owing exclusive political
    allegiance to the U.S. Furthermore, there has never been an explicit holding by
    the Supreme Court that the children of illegal aliens are automatically accorded
    birthright citizenship. In the case of Wong Kim Ark (1898) the Court ruled that
    a child born in the U.S. of legal aliens was entitled to &ldquo;birthright citizenship&rdquo;
    under the 14th Amendment. This was a 5&ndash;4 opinion which provoked the dissent
    of Chief Justice Melville Fuller, who argued that, contrary to the reasoning of
    the majority&rsquo;s holding, the 14th Amendment did not in fact adopt the common-law
    understanding of birthright citizenship. GET FREE EXCLUSIVE NR CONTENT The framers
    of the Constitution were, of course, well-versed in the British common law, having
    learned its essential principles from William Blackstone&rsquo;s Commentaries
    on the Laws of England. As such, they knew that the very concept of citizenship
    was unknown in British common law. Blackstone speaks only of &ldquo;birthright
    subjectship&rdquo; or &ldquo;birthright allegiance,&rdquo; never using the terms
    &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; or &ldquo;citizenship.&rdquo; The idea of birthright subjectship,
    as Blackstone admitted, was derived from feudal law. It is the relation of master
    and servant: All who are born within the protection of the king owed perpetual
    allegiance as a &ldquo;debt of gratitude.&rdquo; According to Blackstone, this
    debt is &ldquo;intrinsic&rdquo; and &ldquo;cannot be forfeited, cancelled, or
    altered.&rdquo; Birthright subjectship under common law is the doctrine of perpetual
    allegiance. America&rsquo;s Founders rejected this doctrine. The Declaration of
    Independence, after all, solemnly proclaims that &ldquo;the good People of these
    Colonies . . . are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that
    all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought
    to be totally dissolved.&rdquo; So, the common law &mdash; the feudal doctrine
    of perpetual allegiance &mdash; could not possibly serve as the ground of American
    citizenship. Indeed, the idea is too preposterous to entertain. RELATED: Trump&rsquo;s
    Immigration Plan Is a Good Start &mdash; For All GOP Candidates Consider as well
    that, in 1868, Congress passed the Expatriation Act. This permitted American citizens
    to renounce their allegiance and alienate their citizenship. This piece of legislation
    was supported by Senator Howard and other leading architects of the 14th Amendment,
    and characterized the right of expatriation as &ldquo;a natural and inherent right
    of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the right of life, liberty and
    the pursuit of happiness.&rdquo; Like the idea of citizenship, this right of expatriation
    is wholly incompatible with the common-law understanding of perpetual allegiance
    and subjectship. One member of the House expressed the general sense of Congress
    when he proclaimed: &ldquo;The old feudal doctrine stated by Blackstone and adopted
    as part of the common law of England . . . is not only at war with the theory
    of our institutions, but is equally at war with every principle of justice and
    of sound public policy.&rdquo; The notion of birthright citizenship was characterized
    by another member as an &ldquo;indefensible doctrine of indefeasible allegiance,&rdquo;
    a feudal doctrine wholly at odds with republican government. Nor was this the
    only legislation concerning birthright citizenship that Congress passed following
    the ratification of the 14th Amendment. As mentioned above, there was almost unanimous
    agreement among its framers that the amendment did not extend citizenship to Indians.
    Although born in the U.S., they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S.
    Beginning in 1870, however, Congress began to pass legislation offering citizenship
    to Indians on a tribe-by-tribe basis. Finally, in 1923, there was a universal
    offer to all tribes. Any Indian who consented could become a citizen. Thus Congress
    used its legislative authority under Section Five of the 14th Amendment to determine
    who was within the jurisdiction of the U.S. It could make a similar determination
    today, based on this legislative precedent, that children born in the U.S. to
    illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. A constitutional
    amendment is no more required today than it was in 1923. A nation that cannot
    determine who becomes citizens or believes that it must allow the children of
    those who defy its laws to become citizens is no longer a sovereign nation. Legislation
    to end birthright citizenship has been circulating in Congress since the mid &rsquo;90s
    and such a bill is circulating in both houses today. It will, of course, not pass
    Congress, and if it did pass it would be vetoed. But if birthright citizenship
    becomes an election issue and a Republican is elected president, then who knows
    what the future might hold. It is difficult to imagine that the framers of the
    14th Amendment intended to confer the boon of citizenship on the children of illegal
    aliens when they explicitly denied that boon to Indians who had been born in the
    United States. Those who defy the laws of the U.S. should not be allowed to confer
    such an advantage on their children. This would not be visiting the sins of the
    parents on the children, as is often claimed, since the children of illegal aliens
    born in the U.S. would not be denied anything to which they otherwise would have
    a right. Their allegiance should follow that of their parents during their minority.
    A nation that cannot determine who becomes citizens or believes that it must allow
    the children of those who defy its laws to become citizens is no longer a sovereign
    nation. No one is advocating that those who have been granted birthright citizenship
    be stripped of their citizenship. Equal protection considerations would counsel
    that citizenship once granted is vested and cannot be revoked; this, I believe,
    is eminently just. The proposal to end birthright citizenship is prospective only.
    MORE IMMIGRATION THE VERY REAL ECONOMIC COSTS OF BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP WHAT CONSERVATIVES
    GET WRONG ABOUT BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP AND THE CONSTITUTION DONALD TRUMP&rsquo;S
    HALF-SERIOUS, HALF-FANTASY IMMIGRATION PLAN Political pundits believe that Trump
    should not press such divisive issues as immigration and citizenship. It is clear,
    however, that he has struck a popular chord &mdash; and touched an important issue
    that should be debated no matter how divisive. Both the Republican party and the
    Democratic party want to avoid the issue because, while both parties advocate
    some kind of reform, neither party has much interest in curbing illegal immigration:
    Republicans want cheap and exploitable labor and Democrats want future voters.
    Who will get the best of the bargain I will leave for others to decide. &mdash;

    that Gray meant what he wrote in *Ark*. (Yoo clerked for Clarence Thomas and is
    a law professor at Berkeley.) Judge Andrew Napolitano might classify as an expert,
    too, and he also believes that birthright citizenship changes require a Constitutional
    amendment. And that's exactly my point. \n\nWe have conservatives on talk radio
    telling people that simple law or executive order is all that's needed to change
    birthright citizenship. But the fact that numerous conservative legal experts
    disagree tells you that the fight would be long and hard. At best, the law would
    be on hold until it gets to the Supreme Court (2 years, maybe?). And I honestly
    think the court would strike it down. \n\nNext, we'd go to a Constitutional amendment.
    How long would that take? \n\nIn the meantime, we have plenty of other problems
    to solve, the open border. Fix that. I want that fixed. And Trump can probably
    build a wall before his legislation ever gets to the Supreme Court. \n\nRush Limbaugh
    and Mark Levin shouting that we can change everything tomorrow with a simple bill
    in Congress are misdirecting people's energy and attention to a fight they're
    not going to win. While we fight that battle, millions more illegals will enter
    the country.\n\nIf we don't prioritize and face the world as it is instead of
    the way we want it to be, we're going to accomplish as much in the next 8 years
    as we accomplished in the last 8."

    set with the American Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. The Republicans should write
    up the statute and see where it goes. Most DemonRATS would not support it and

    a show/shell vote to repeal Obamacare over 50 times. Talk about a waste of time,
    when Boehner and McConnel do not have the courage to not FUND it.  I have contacted

    What should be done is secure the border; end sanctuary cities by defunding them

    deporting the illegals an impossible task. It is not. First off, the 11+million,
    with the emphasis on the plus, did not come all at once. If they did, it would
    have been considered an invasion, although, in reality it was an invasion. Let
    it be known that if you are here illegally, you will be found and you will be
    deported.  Deputize all law enforcement to handle illegal immigration. Then, when
    law enforcement comes across them they would be put into the system for deportation.
    They would be jailed with a high bond until their hearing and then deport them.
    There are plea bargains done every day in our court system, so instead of jailing
    them give the apprehended illegals the option of leaving the country or be placed
    in jail, until their hearing wherein they then would be deported. Most of the

    in charge to ENFORCE the law."

<p>It's sad that Donald Trump has inspired so many good conservatives to promote fantasies&nbsp;about the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court addressed the issue of birthright citizenship directly, and Mark Levin and Laura Ingram know it. They are Constitutional lawyers.</p>
<p>Both Levin and Ingraham are familiar with <em>United States v. Wong Kim Ark</em> (1898) which established, thoroughly, that cit<span class="text_exposed_show">izenship by birth has been the law of the land since before the Declaration of Independence and was codified by the 14th Amendment. (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3381955771263111765&amp;q=United+States+v.+Wong+Kim+Ark&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6%2C26&amp;as_vis=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case&hellip;</a>).</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>From the majority opinion:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Passing by questions once earnestly controverted, but finally put at rest by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, it is beyond doubt that, before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 or the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, <strong>all white persons, at least, born within the sovereignty of the United States, whether children of citizens or of foreigners, excepting only children of ambassadors or public ministers of a foreign government, were native-born citizens of the United States</strong>."</p></blockquote>
<p>The opinion goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>"As appears upon the face of the amendment, as well as from the history of the times, <strong>this was not intended to impose any new restrictions upon citizenship, or to prevent any persons from becoming citizens by the fact of birth within the United States, who would thereby have become citizens according to the law existing before its adoption</strong>. It is declaratory in form, and enabling and extending in effect. Its main purpose doubtless was, as has been often recognized by this court, to establish the citizenship of free negroes, which had been denied in the opinion delivered by Chief Justice Taney in Dred Scott v. Sandford, (1857) and to put it beyond doubt that all blacks, as well as whites, born or naturalized within the jurisdiction of the United States, are citizens of the United States."</p></blockquote>
<p>And, finally, the Supreme Court ruled:</p>
<blockquote><p>"<strong>The Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory</strong>, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes."</p></blockquote>
<p>Levin, Ingraham, and Limbaugh are arguing that the <em>Wong Kim Ark</em> case was decided wrongly and the <em>Dred Scott</em>&nbsp;case was decided rightly! (Not a good position.) But, even if Dred Scott was right at the time (and it was not), it was overturned by the 14th Amendment, as <em>Wong Kim Ark</em> makes clear: "finally put at rest by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution . . ."</p>
<p>I realize that immigration is a hot-button issue. But promoting fantasies&nbsp;about the Constitution does no good.<strong> I thought we conservatives believed in original intent or, like me and Robert Bork, original understanding.</strong></p>
<p>Levin, Ingraham, and Limbaugh are now firmly in the "living Constitution" camp, wanting to change the meaning of the text to fit the needs of the moment.</p>
<p>Don't fall for it. The Constitution is not dead, but it's dormant. It comes to life through Article V, not through talk radio.</p>
</div>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Some have raised the question on Facebook of allegiance. In short, does allegiance to country of origin on the part of the parents prevent a child of immigrants, born on US soil, from jurisdiction under the 14th Amendment?</p>
<p>Justice Gray's opinion in&nbsp;<em>Wong Kim Ark</em> anticipated this argument and negated it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the<b>United </b><b>States</b>. His allegiance to the <b>United </b><b>States</b> is direct and immediate, and, although but local and temporary, continuing only so long as he remains within our territory, is yet, in the words of Lord Coke, in <i>Calvin's Case,</i> 7 Rep. 6<i>a,</i> "strong enough to make a natural subject, for if he hath issue here, that issue is a natural-born subject;" and his child, as said by Mr. Binney in his essay before quoted, "if born in the country, is as much a citizen as the natural-born child of a citizen, and by operation of the same principle."</p></blockquote>
<p>Van Harvey provides some great arguments against my opinion on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bill.hennessy2/posts/10153120634565886" target="_blank"> this epic Facebook thread</a>. You have to read it.</p>
