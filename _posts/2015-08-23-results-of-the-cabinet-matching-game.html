<p>A couple weeks ago, I published a simple game for political nerds. Assuming the next president must build a cabinet from current candidates for the Republican nomination for president, how would you assign candidates to cabinet positions.</p>
<p>This was meant to be a fun exercise for people who spend too much time thinking about politics. Like the leaders-eat-last poll, this required hide, often dissatisfying choices. As a result, only six people completed the exercise which took up to a half hour.</p>
<p>Here's the cabinet you put together, using only the top position for candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carly Fiorina: Secretary of Commerce</li>
<li>Ben Carson: Secretary of Health and Human Services</li>
<li>Jeb Bush: (4-way tie) Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of State, Secretary of Interior, Secretary of Energy</li>
<li>Ted Cruz: Attorney General</li>
<li>Rand Paul: Secretary of Treasury</li>
<li>Marco Rubio: Secretary of Energy</li>
<li>Scott Walker: Secretary of Labor</li>
<li>Chris Christie: Secretary of Veterans Affairs</li>
<li>Mike Huckabee: Secretary of Agriculture</li>
<li>Donald Trump: Secretary of Treasury</li>
<li>John Kasich: Secretary of Interior</li>
<li>George Pataki: Secretary of Trasnportation</li>
<li>Jim Gilmore: Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</li>
<li>Bobby Jindal: Secretary of Education</li>
<li>Lindsey Graham: Secretary of Defense</li>
<li>Rick Perry: Secretary of Homeland Security</li>
</ul>
