<p>Sorry for the dearth of posts.</p>
<p>You know I have a day job. Sometimes that day job becomes a night job. And a weekend job, too.</p>
<p>That's happened.</p>
<p>I'm still keeping up on what's going on in the world, but travel and software launches and strategic plans have me spinning.</p>
<p>I like to write when I have a long periods of uninterrupted time. Well, those blocks of time have been few and far between.</p>
<p>I should get back to the blog in a couple of weeks. Until then, please read <a href="http://amzn.to/1LWhKqa" target="_blank">The Conservative Heart by Arthur C. Brooks</a>. Because a change in national mood will blow in soon, and <a href="http://amzn.to/1LWhKqa"><strong>The Conservative Heart</strong></a> provides the blueprint to owning the next era.</p>
