<p>If you read this blog, you have a mile-wide curiosity streak.</p>
<p>Many of you want to know more about Eric Greitens.</p>
<p>You have a great chance to learn more on Saturday, September 26 at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Eric Greitens will have some things to say. Perhaps he won't say&nbsp;everything you want to hear. (It's still 11 months until the primary.) But he'll say things you need to hear.</p>
<p>And that's my favorite thing about Eric. He says what people need to hear&nbsp;instead of merely repeating what polls and pols say you want to hear.</p>

<p>Especially if you're not fully committed to Greitens for Governor, this is a chance to meet a humanitarian, a Rhodes Scholar, a Navy SEAL, a boxing champion, a veterans charity founder, and a best-selling author from St. Louis. Is he a mere "motivational speaker," as some cynical folks suggest, or is he a the leader Missouri needs to climb off the bottom of almost every measure of economic growth? Curious people like you will want to meet him and decide for yourself.</p>
