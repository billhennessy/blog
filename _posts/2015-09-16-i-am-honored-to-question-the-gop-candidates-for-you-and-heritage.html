<p>This is pretty cool and a little unnerving.</p>
<p>Heritage Action has extended the&nbsp;honor to be one of three Heritage Action Sentinels to&nbsp;question <a href="http://takebackevent.com/" target="_blank">Republican Presidential candidates</a> on Friday, September 17 in Greenville, South Carolina. So far, 12 candidates have confirmed, including Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, and Marco Rubio. (Maybe Trump will make fun of my tie.)</p>
<p>I have no idea why Heritage would pick me for this privilege. I just hope I don't screw it up. To that end, your prayers will be appreciated. (I'm sure many people have already muttered under their breaths, "Please, God, don't let him screw this up." I thank you.) I promise not to ramble about national service, okay?</p>
<p>Please check this blog or www.heritageaction.com for details on C-SPAN's schedule for the event's airing. (As of this writing, it is not scheduled for live broadcast.)</p>
<p>And, now, please find out <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/09/15/there-is-no-liberty-without-pursuit-of-happiness/">why pursuit of happiness is essential to liberty</a>.</p>
