<p>Suggested donation is $25. Gold donor $100.</p>
<p>RSVP danhyatt4missouri@gmail.com</p>
<p>We got to know Dan Hyatt at an After Party at Sky Music Lounge back in about 2011.</p>
<p>Dan quickly chose a mission for himself: red light and speed cameras. His research and testimony helped build the consensus against the devices.</p>
<p>Dan also championed the cause of municipal court reform with us last year. His researched helped craft the legislation and rally the troops in support of Eric Schmitt's SB-5.</p>
<p>Dan is a true champion of liberty. His election will move Missouri away from rule by entrenched elites and closer to the American ideal.</p>
<p>If you cannot attend Tuesday's launch, you may donate to:</p>
