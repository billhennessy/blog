  content: We can talk all we want about Congress, but the truth is the corruption
    will continue, the debt will continue to surge, the Extreme Court will continue
    to legislate from the bench, etc.  If you want real change, a solution as big
    as the problem, we need an Article V Convention of States (www.conventionofstates.org).  Let's
    talk about that.

  content: "The Freedom Caucus seems to have some teeth. Huh, interesting...our 2nd
    District Congresswoman's staffers seemed confused when I talked about a gathering
    of conservatives in the house gaining some strength and not accepting every dipcone
    w an R in front of their name. They snickered at the idea...\r\n\r\nAnd Bill,
    Putin rides shirtless on bears not horses...atleast in my view anyway. \r\nGo

  content: Ann's minions operate at a severe disadvantage when they operate against
    you. You, Dottie, are an informed Sentinel. They are mushrooms in an establishment
    dark room. As <del datetime="2015-10-16T03:18:35+00:00">CCR</del> Leadbelly said,
    let  the midnight special shine an everlovin' light shine on the political elite.
    (Well, that's what they meant, anyway.)

<p>The headline is a play on the oft-chanted slogan from&nbsp;OWS&nbsp;protests. Please, no "it's not a democracy" emails.</p>
<p>That's a threat.</p>
<p>A couple years&nbsp;ago on a Saturday night, I wrote about 2,000 words on the meaning of "democracy" and "republic." I never posted it out of pity for you. I'm telling you, there's a lot of Montesquieu in it, so if you don't like superfluous vowels, don't make me post it now.</p>
<p>The journalism world, and some Democrats in Congress, are feigning concern over the "chaos" of the Republican caucus. I've seen where Democratic Congressmen have described the search for a speaker as an "embarrassment."</p>
<p>Good God, people, sober up. We just abandoned Syria after erasing our own red line because Putin showed up shirtless on horseback brandishing an AK-47 and drinking Schlitz from a 25 ounce (one ounce free) can. And you're embarrassed that <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/10/11/whip-it-whip-it-good/">Kevin McCarthy withdrew his name</a>?</p>
<p>This is how a republic resolves disputes. We don't shoot each other, save for a few precincts in north and south St. Louis. Instead we try to form coalitions to support a candidate acceptable to varying factions of the&nbsp;majority&nbsp;party. It's not perfect, but it's how things&nbsp;are supposed&nbsp;to work.</p>
<h3>The Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>Suppose the Republicans were unable to choose a new speaker before the end of Congress&nbsp;CXIV. What's the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>John&nbsp;Boehner&nbsp;doesn't retire.</p>
<p>That's the worst possible outcome.</p>
<p>Santa doesn't shoot himself. Obama doesn't get a third term. Hillary doesn't strip on live TV. We just get stuck with another year and a half of Speaker&nbsp;Boehner.</p>
<h3>The Best Case Scenario</h3>
<p>What if we&nbsp;get&nbsp;a new speaker? The new speaker, mathematically speaking, would have&nbsp;to be&nbsp;acceptable to the House Freedom Caucus. That person&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;your first choice or mine, but someone the Freedom Caucus could live with is someone I could live with.</p>
<p>[Tweet "Santa doesn't shoot himself. Obama doesn't get a third term. Hillary doesn't strip on live TV. "]</p>
<p>So&nbsp;mellow the harsh, America.&nbsp;<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2013/02/24/why-the-sequester-is-worse-now-than-it-will-be-after-it-happens/">Nothing is as bad as you think it will be when you're thinking about it</a>. The House will have its speaker just as the dog will have its day. And the sun will rise and the Cubs will find a way to blow it.</p>
<p>Everything will be okay.</p>
