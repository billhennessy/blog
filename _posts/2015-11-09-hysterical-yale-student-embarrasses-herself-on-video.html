  content: The leftists do not know the true meaning of "tolerance." Their definition
    is for others to do, think and say things that they believe in. Anything else
    is taboo. I found it ironic when the students at Mississippi University,  in the
    name of tolerance, had the Mississippi State flag  removed from the campus because
    it has the Confederate Battle flag incorporated in it . Not taking into account
    those people who support the Confederate Battle, such as the Sons and Daughters
    of the Confederacy. Leftists are HYPOCRITES and define the term intolerance.

<p>Nicholas&nbsp;Christakis&nbsp;is a giant in social psychology.</p>
<p>And social psychology is only part of his resume. He's also a medical doctor.</p>
<p>Christakis&nbsp;wrote one of the most important books on social networks (the real kind, not Facebook),&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.connectedthebook.com" target="_blank">Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks</a></em>. He holds distinguished positions at both Yale and Harvard and has appeared on Time Magazine's list of 100 Most Influential People in the World.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Christakis&nbsp;also&nbsp;treats&nbsp;homebound hospice patients, alleviating suffering for those in the&nbsp;final&nbsp;days of life.</p>
<p>But just before Halloween, Dr.&nbsp;Christakis&nbsp;crossed a line. He shared his opinion with his wife, who shared it with residents of a student building at Yale, setting off a firestorm that threatens to end the career of one of the America's most distinguished social psychologists.</p>
<p>What was Dr.&nbsp;Christakis's&nbsp;oppressive opinion?&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/racial-tensions-boiling-over-at-yale-2015-11">According to Nicholas&nbsp;Christakis's&nbsp;wife</a>, in Business Insider:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Nicholas says, if you don&rsquo;t like a costume someone is wearing, look away, or tell them you&nbsp;are offended. Talk to each other. Free speech and the ability to tolerate offense are the hallmarks of a free and open society," [Erika]&nbsp;Christakis&nbsp;wrote in her email. "In other words: Whose business is it to control the forms of costumes of young people? It&rsquo;s not mine, I know that."</p></blockquote>
<p>Before Halloween, the school's administration sent an email to students advising them to avoid costumes that might offend any hypersensitive students.</p>
<p>Erika&nbsp;Christakis, who serves as co-Master of&nbsp;Silliman&nbsp;College residence, asked her students whether Yale, or any authority, should limit free expression. In other words, she was challenging students to think for themselves.</p>
<p>It turns out, Yale's open-minded, inquisitive, tolerant students want Yale's overlords dictating costume choices to students. Yale students hate thinking for themselves. So much so that&nbsp;one&nbsp;maladjusted, spoiled, brat accosted Dr.&nbsp;Christakis&nbsp;on campus:</p>

<p>So, an undergrad whose life's accomplishments compare poorly to Dr.&nbsp;Christakis's&nbsp;accomplishments by 9 a.m. on any given day, calls him "disgusting" because he believes in free speech and open dialogue.</p>
<p>Here's a shot of the hysterical&nbsp;brat as she stormed away from the confrontation:</p>

" width="203" height="174" /> Yale student who hates free speech and open dialogue.[/caption]</p>
<p>This young woman is the dictionary definition of "leftist intolerance," a psychological disorder resulting from having never&nbsp;been&nbsp;told "no" as a child. To paraphrase William F. Buckley, the young woman's speech elicits the sort of sympathy we feel for the ignorance of idiots.</p>
<p>The proper response from Yale would be to kick her ass out, but we know that won't happen. As we saw at University of Missouri, the children run the show on colleges. Which may explain why&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-25/dumb-dumber-scientific-proof-people-are-getting-stupider">Americans are dumber than they've ever been</a>.</p>
