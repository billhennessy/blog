  content: The thin skinned, big eared, narcissistic, Community Agitator, Hussein
    Obama sidea with the agitators at Mizzou. And why wouldn&rsquo;t he, after all
    he supports the protests and is behind the racial tension throughout the country.

<p>You can't make this stuff up.</p>
<p>Concerned Student 1950, the group that seized public ground for private use at the University of Missouri has a new concern today. It seems <strong>the kiddos are upset that ISIS deigned to steal the headlines</strong> by killing 120 to 150 people in Paris, wounding 200 others.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_17044" align="aligncenter" width="522"]<img class="wp-image-17044 size-full" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screenshot-2015-11-14-07.48.04.png" alt="narcissism" width="522" height="273" /> narcissism: psychology: extreme selfishness, with a grandiose view of one's own talents and a craving for admiration, as characterizing a personality type.[/caption]</p>
<p>As news of the horror in Paris unfolded, the narcissistic, privileged, spoiled, petulant children of Mizzou's protest movement took to Twitter to demand the spotlight return to Columbia.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://therightscoop.com/un-effing-believable-mizzou-protesters-are-angry-paris-terror-attacks-stole-their-media-spotlight/">the story on Right Scoop by Soopermexican</a>. Because&nbsp;many of the tweets have been deleted (maybe on the advice of a sympathetic Mass Media instructor at Mizzou?), here's a sample of narcissism run amok at University of Missouri:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's black kids trapped in their rooms at #Mizzou but y'all talking about #PrayforParis. Fuck Paris #PrayforMizzou --Sleaze Rich Porter (@Sleazemontana)</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Paris is all over my local news but I didn't see shit about the KKK threatening #Mizzou ????? --@masturbad</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>I do pray for Paris, but people need to start seeing what's going on in our own country. I BARELY saw anything about #Mizzou. Quite sad --@jkleimz</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now people are desensitizing #BlackLivesMatter and #Mizzou for what's happening in Paris, have you no common decency? --@Alasia_Justine</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't use the tragedy in Paris to try and undermine the awful things that are happening at #Mizzou. Both of these events are terrible. --@curvyyandcurlyy</p></blockquote>
<p>People tell you who they are. I have no doubt <strong>each of these people is sincere</strong>. The kids on the quadrangle at Mizzou truly believe their plight is the equal of the victims in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>We call them "kids" for a reason. They haven't lived</strong>. When they say stupid things, we say "that's not really who they are."</p>
<p>But we're wrong. They're wrong. <strong>And some adult should say, "you are wrong, child. You are wrong."</strong></p>
<p>Now you know who <strong>#ConcernedStudent1950 is: a spoiled, privileged, child mired in the quicksand of extreme narcissism</strong>. With a little race&nbsp;hatred and fascist control-needs on top.</p>
<p>[Tweet "As news of the horror in Paris unfolded, the narcissistic, privileged, spoiled, petulant children of Mizzou's protest movement took to Twitter to demand the spotlight return to Columbia."]</p>
<p>Hope your 15-minutes were worth it, kids. Just like <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/11/09/hysterical-yale-student-embarrasses-herself-on-video/">the kids at Yale</a>.</p>
