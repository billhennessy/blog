  content: I fear Paul Ryan is going to pull a &ldquo;rope a dope&rdquo; on the American
    people concerning the invasion of Muslims to this country. Instead of using the
    power of the purse and withhold funding, they are going to have a standalone bill
    dealing with the screening/vetting these people, before letting them into the
    country. First, according to the security experts there is no way to vet these
    people and believe ISIS will infiltrate them. Second, it will be the Obama Administration
    that will be vetting these people and given Hussein Obama supports this invasion
    how well do you think that will go? Then there is how will the refugees help out
    this country? What benefit do they bring to this country? In fact, it is costing
    American taxpayers to bring them here and support them.  Finally,Sharia Law is
    not compatible with the US Constitution and the American culture. Will these Syrian
    refugees assimilate to the American culture? I think not. In fact our children
    are being indoctrinated in schools into the Muslim culture. The primary responsibility
    of the president and the federal government is to protect its citizens from an
    invasion to which this would be. Obama could care less about protecting American
    citizens and it shows from his actions. Giving aid and comfort to the enemy is
    TREASON, an impeachable offense.   I say let the Arab Nations deal with the situation,
    instead of bringing the problem to our shores and possibly endangering U.S. citizens.

  content: To all DemonRATS and RINO&rsquo;s, this includes Hussein Obama, governors
    and mayors, concerning the Muslim &ldquo;refugees/migrants&rdquo; I have one question
    for you. How many of them are you going to take into your homes?

  content: Obama is a traitor, in fact he is not our true president.  Why does he
    not release his records to prove he is eligible and then we can remove him from
    office and undo all of his policies.  He is a disgrace and Congress has let us
    down big time.  They are corrupt and when Trump becomes president, I hope he prosecutes
    those traitors.  If Clinton gets in it is because the election is rigged and to
    save their necks from prosecution.  America stand up to this corrupted piece of
    shit in office.  He is NOT one of us.

<p>In the war on terror, you&rsquo;re on our side or theirs.</p>
<p>Barack Obama announced that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/r-white-house-says-obama-would-veto-proposal-for-more-scrutiny-of-refugees-2015-11" target="_blank">he will veto any attempt by Congress to require background checks of Syrian refugees in an attempt to weed out ISIS terrorists</a>. <strong>The President's allegiances are now clear</strong>.</p>
<p>I heard Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) say that <a href="http://www.wjbc.com/2015/11/17/durbin-concerned-about-how-to-screen-syrian-refugees/" target="_blank">we must ensure proper screening</a> in the wake of last Friday&rsquo;s Islamic terrorist attack in Paris.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/11/18/house-gop-moves-on-urgent-effort-to-strengthen-vetting-of-syrian-refugees-speaker-ryan-promises-no-religious-test/" target="_blank">House of Representatives is working on legislation</a> to do just that: increase the likelihood that we will catch terrorist infiltraters before they reach American soil.</p>
<p><strong>But Barack Obama wants none of it.</strong></p>
<p>Barack Obama wants the <strong>floodgates open</strong>.</p>
<p>Barack <strong>Obama has allegiances </strong>the American people, our traditions, and our institutions do not share.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s time for responsible Democrats to choose sides</strong>. Ours or theirs. America's or his.</p>
<p>We are not on Obama&rsquo;s side, and he he is not on ours.</p>
