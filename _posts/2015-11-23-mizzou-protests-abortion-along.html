<p>I hate to say "I told you so."</p>
<p>But the St. Louis Post Dispatch has found that <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/11/08/are-abortionists-manipulating-mizzous-black-athletes/">I may have been right on November 8</a>. That's when I made the outlandish comment that <strong>the whole race issue at Mizzou is actually an abortion issue.</strong> I suspected that Planned Parenthood's vast lobbyist network is agitating leaders of left-leaning organizations trying to create general unrest.</p>
<p><strong>The manipulators would use campus racial unrest to demand restored privileges for Planned Parenthood.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Lo and behold,<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/mizzou-students-putting-pressure-on-university-to-continue-relationship-with/article_2a3208e2-9328-519f-bc9a-b28ab7cd1330.html"> from stltoday.com</a>:</p>

Bowen Loftin</a>&nbsp;as University of Missouri-Columbia chancellor on Nov. 9, some Mizzou students and <strong>abortion-rights supporters saw an opportunity to try to reverse a controversial university decision.</strong></p>
<p>They have begun a campaign seeking to pressure Mizzou Interim Chancellor Hank Foley to reconsider Loftin&rsquo;s decision to&nbsp;<a title="http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/planned-parenthood-looks-for-alternative-privileging-options/article_9374fe04-8483-5497-b5eb-76c73a5a69f5.html" href="http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/planned-parenthood-looks-for-alternative-privileging-options/article_9374fe04-8483-5497-b5eb-76c73a5a69f5.html" target="_blank">eliminate a category of clinical privilege</a>&nbsp;at the university&rsquo;s hospital that is likely to end the ability of women to get abortions in Columbia after the end of this month.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it. <strong>Concerned Student 1950 is nothing more than &nbsp;Planned Parenthood's bitch</strong>, churning up some fetuses for the abortion mill, and carrying out the eugenicists' dream of a world free from the plague of inferior breeding.</p>
