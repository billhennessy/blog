  content: "Bill, I know you are supporting Eric Greitens for Governor of Missouri.
    I myself am staying out of the primary and may help the winner. The question I
    have is Greitens refused to answer Adam Sharp when he questioned about when he
    became a Republican. There is a video of the confrontation. As for the tape of
    John Brunner and Eric Greitens it showed Greitens to be a bully and wants things
    his way. As for the release of the tape I thought it was underhanded and sneaky
    and does not show highly of Brunner. \r\nThere are other problems I have with
    Greitens. Why did Greitens not run as a Conservative Democrat against the leftist
    lib Chris Koster? Greitens charitable group is affiliated with the Clinton Global
    Initiative. Why would he want to be involved in that criminal enterprise?  Greitens
    also believes in the hoax of climate change and there is video of that. Greitens
    supports a World Government. Other questions that should be answered are: what
    is his position on immigration; on the refugee/migrant situation; and what is
    his position on Common Core? As I stated, I am staying out of the primary and
    may help the winner."

  content: "Greg,\n\nHow does one really answer \"when did you become a conservative?\"
    I think most people who migrate from one ideology, particularly one adopted from
    family of origin, the change happens slowly. Reagan's conversion took a decade
    or more. \n\nAs for his organizations and their affiliations, I can't answer.
    I do know that he formed the organizations before he recognized his political
    conversion and well before he decided to run for Governor. \n\nWhen it comes to
    his past statements, he was a Democrat and began as a fairly liberal Democrat.
    I'd be surprised if he didn't say a few things that grate our ears. \n\nBully?
    Really? Republicans are using the bully card now? What I heard was an angry man,
    angry because his opponent refused to acknowledge (or explicitly deny) connection
    to a website that attacks Greitens' integrity. Abraham Lincoln was involved in
    a duel over less. And Greitens went straight to the source with his complaint.
    I can tell you that I've been far more hostile with people on the phone, including
    with friends. \n\nWhy didn't Greitens run as a Democrat? Because he finds the
    Democrat Party incompatible with his worldview. And, while I don't know this,
    I suspect that Eric would consider it a lie to run as a Democrat with the intention
    of switching parties after the election. \n\nFinally, I've watched people migrate
    politically, including my wife and Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. And Arianna
    Huffington. While every political conversion is unique, they share one thing in
    common: they don't stop. At least later-in-life conversions never stop. However
    conservative Greitens is right now, he will be more conservative tomorrow. And
    more so next year. \n\nI have sat in a room with Eric on a couple of occasions.
    I have read his books. I have never met a person I'd rather follow. I know some
    of his policy mentors, and I trust them implicitly. I believe that Eric Greitens'
    campaign presents Missourians with a rare historical opportunity to halt our country's
    unravelling. I could be wrong, but I am taking this leap of faith with both feet."

HAWKEYE: Hi, Stinky.<br />
RADAR: Uh, sir, that's the sort of name that kind of sticks with a fella. I'd appreciate it if you'd just call me by my given nickname.</p>

<p>Some names stick with a fella.</p>
<p>A friend emailed the link and this note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brunner is indeed a weasel</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>John Brunner, candidate for governor, surreptitiously recorded a phone conversation with his opponent Eric Greitens</strong>. Then, after the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article44802384.html" target="_blank">Kansas City Star reported that a Brunner confidant had set up an anti-Greitens website</a>, Brunner released the recording&nbsp;to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/kevin-mcdermott/oh-my-god-you-are-such-a-weasel-and-other/article_9655e089-9e12-56da-a6e6-44462ef76807.html" target="_blank">read all about it and listen to the recording here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>There were no smoking guns on the recording</strong>. Eric Greitens sounds angry about the website and about Brunner&rsquo;s refusal to either confirm or deny complicity. (A woman can be heard in the background urging Brunner to deny, deny, deny, but Brunner never does.)</p>
<p>For his part, John Brunner simply evades the question and plants unverified information on the tape. <strong>Ya know, <a href="http://nixontapes.org/" target="_blank">like Richard Nixon</a></strong>.</p>
<p>[Tweet "Brunner is indeed a weasel"]</p>
<p><strong>Brunner's surreptitious recording and leak&nbsp;is sleazy, of course</strong>, and it&rsquo;s just the kind of childish politics we expect from Missouri Republicans. Brunner was supposed to be above this kind of chicanery.</p>
<p>I doubt the episode will have a long shelf-life even though it provides perverse entertainment for Missouri politics geeks.</p>
<p>The only lasting effect will be <strong>a sticky nickname for Brunner: The Weasel.</strong></p>
