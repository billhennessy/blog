  content: If you see something, say something, unless they are Muslims, then don't
    say anything for fear of being called a bigot! The neighbors of these jihadists
    in San Bernardino saw suspicious activity going on in the jihadist&rsquo; garage
    but did not say anything for fear of being called racist. Welcome to ObamaNation!
    I point out to you the Muslim activist, Ahmed Muhamed of Irving, Texas brought
    a hoax bomb to school and was praised and rewarded for it, instead of being prosecuted.
    Hussein Obama did not stand with the school and law enforcement; instead Obama
    mocked and demonized them and praised the Muslim activist. Obama then invited
    Ahmed Muhamed to the White House. Ahmed was made a celebrity by leftists. CEO&rsquo;s
    from Facebook and Google invited him to their corporate headquarters. Commie Deblasio
    of New York gave him the royal treatment, as did many others. So, the message
    that was sent to the American people was/is If you see something, say something,
    unless they are Muslims and that is what is happening.

<p>I won&rsquo;t blame the neighbors, but the neighbors knew.</p>
<p>Syed Farook and four or five others worked long hours in Farook&rsquo;s San Bernardino garage for months leading up to a deadly Islamic terror attack last week.</p>
<p>Neighbors knew. <strong>They knew Farook and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, were up to no good</strong>. But the neighbors said nothing until after the massacre at a center for the developmentally disabled.</p>
<p><strong>The suspicious neighbors were afraid, not of the Muslim terrorists, but of political correctness. </strong>The suspicious neighbors call to authorities might have uncovered the Muslim IED factory and armory before the murders. But the neighbors were more afraid of America&rsquo;s liberals than of America&rsquo;s murderous enemies.</p>
<p>And now the silent neighbors carry the regret of saying nothing. Via t<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3344736/Neighbors-Saudi-husband-wife-San-Bernardino-shooters-noticed-acting-suspiciously-did-NOT-report-fear-racial-profiling.html" target="_blank">he Daily Mail:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Aaron Elswick, whose friend lives on the street, told KTLA a neighbor described her regret at not reporting Farook and Malik.</p>
<p>'Sounds like she didn't do anything about it,' Elswick said.</p>
<p>'<strong>She didn't want to do any kind of racial profiling</strong>. She's like, 'I didn't call it in &hellip; maybe it was just me thinking something that's not there.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Tyranny of the Bubblemakers</h3>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/11/08/are-abortionists-manipulating-mizzous-black-athletes/">Racial separatists at Mizzou</a> and other <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/11/09/hysterical-yale-student-embarrasses-herself-on-video/">universities</a> want to establish free-speech-free zones on their campuses and communities. In these bubbles of ignorance, no one may say or do anything that might offend anyone else.</p>
<p>In these bubbles, <strong>hate speech, even calls for murder, are okay&mdash;as long as everyone in the bubble is okay with murder</strong>.</p>
<p>Since these &ldquo;safe spaces&rdquo; prohibit anyone who might disagree with the bubblemakers, there&rsquo;s no chance of reasonable people talking the bubbledwellers our of their dangerous ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Safe spaces are breeding grounds for terror and murder</strong>.</p>
<p>And the <strong>political-correctness police&nbsp;who applaud &ldquo;safe spaces&rdquo; must accept the consequences of their actions</strong>: 14 people dead, 21 injured in San Bernardino in part because the PC Police&nbsp;prevailed over common sense and responsibility.</p>
<h3>Bubblemakers Blame the Innocent</h3>
<p>Guilt is a funny thing. People hate feeling guilty. Our brains are wired to avoid shame.</p>
<p>So, when it became clear that political correctness and the silence it demands contributed to the slaughter in California, <strong>the left deflected guilt by blaming prayer</strong>.</p>
<p>The New York Daily News proudly blamed Republicans who offered public prayers for the victims and their families and our nation drew the hateful ire of liberals across the country.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-first-amendment-needs-your-prayers-1449187707" target="_blank">Peggy Noonan noticed it</a>, too:</p>
<blockquote><p>The background is that Republican presidential contestants responded online to the shootings with the only helpful thing you can say&mdash;or do, frankly, from faraway&mdash;when a story like this occurs. &ldquo;Praying for the victims, their families &amp; the San Bernardino first responders,&rdquo; said Jeb Bush. Mike Huckabee said he was &ldquo;praying.&rdquo; John Kasich: &ldquo;My thoughts &amp; prayers go out to those impacted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>This managed to enrage the progressive left</strong>. You can take your prayers and stuff &rsquo;em. The answer and the only answer to this tragedy is gun control, and <strong>if you&rsquo;re not for it you&rsquo;re not allowed to be part of the conversation</strong>. &ldquo;Please shut up and slink away,&rdquo; tweeted a reporter. Another: &ldquo;Your thoughts and prayers don&rsquo;t mean a damn thing.&rdquo; A reporter at the Huffington Post damned public officials&rsquo; &ldquo;useless thoughts and prayers.&rdquo; Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos: &ldquo;How many dead people did those thoughts and prayers bring back to the life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mollie Hemingway of the Federalist noted that all <strong>these denunciations were literally coming in while victims of the shooting were sending out requests for prayer</strong>.</p>
<p>Journalists, bloggers, contrarians and citizens jumped into the fray. Then the U.S. senator, Chris Murphy, came forward rather menacingly. &ldquo;Your &lsquo;thoughts&rsquo; should be about steps to take to stop this carnage. Your &lsquo;prayers&rsquo; should be for forgiveness if you do nothing&mdash;again.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Unable to deal with its guilt, the left now attacks&nbsp;public prayer</strong>. (<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-first-amendment-needs-your-prayers-1449187707" target="_blank">You must read Peggy Noonan&rsquo;s important column</a>.) And, as Ms. Noonan points out, the bubblemakers want their bubbles to cover the nation from sea to acidifying sea.</p>
<p>And just as <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/17/u-s-college-professor-demands-imprisonment-for-climate-change-deniers/" target="_blank">college professors</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2014/03/31/adam-weinstein-neo-nazi-propaganda-machine/">reporters call for&nbsp;summary incarceration&nbsp;</a>of anyone who questions the validity of any aspect of human-caused global warming, <strong>the bubblemakers are aiming their intolerant fire at anyone who believes the Bill of Rights was a good idea</strong>.</p>
<h3>Up From Political Correctness</h3>
<p>We know now that <strong>political correctness kills</strong>. California blood drips accusingly from the fingers of hatemongers like Markos Moulitas and Senator Chris Murphy. The guilt they feel in their cold and wicked hearts inspires, not contrition, but more hate&mdash;hate directed outward at the few remaining vestiges of goodness and decency America stills harbors.</p>
<p>The only way to stop political correctness from killing is to <strong>rise up from political correctness</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by letting the leftist hatemongers know that God loves them. But they should pay close attention to the words of the angel announcing Christ&rsquo;s birth to the shepherds (Luke 2:14):</p>
<blockquote><p>"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth <strong>peace to those on whom his favor rests</strong>."</p></blockquote>
<p>Decades ago, the politically correct crowd rewrote the angel&rsquo;s greeting to assuage their guilt. The PC rewrite strikes the limiting phrase &ldquo;to those on whom his favor rests,&rdquo; implying peace to all. (Surely you've heard "Glory to God in the highest and peace to his people on earth.")</p>
<p>Likewise, at the Last Supper, Christ put boundaries around redemption (Matthew 26:28):</p>
<blockquote><p>This is my blood of the covenant, <strong>which is poured out for many</strong> for the forgiveness of sins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not all. Many. Those on whom God&rsquo;s favor rests.</p>
<p>So, Merry Christmas, leftist PC prayer shamers. <strong>May God&rsquo;s favor come to rest on you. And on me.</strong></p>
