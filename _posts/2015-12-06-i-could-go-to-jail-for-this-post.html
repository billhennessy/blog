  content: "&ldquo;Everything need not result in a lawsuit, but some things do have
    to go to that area,&rdquo; Lynch said, citing the recent case of Ahmed Mohamed,
    the 14-year-old boy who claimed he was the target of Islamophobia after he took
    a disassembled clock to his Irving, Tex. high school.\r\n&ldquo;We have, as you
    may know, opened an investigation into the case of the young man in Irving, Texas.
    We will see where that investigation goes,&rdquo; Lynch said.&rdquo;\r\nUnbelievable!
    Well, not really, coming from the Obama Regime. What is there to investigate?
    Ahmed Muhamed of Irving, Texas brought a hoax bomb to school and was praised and
    rewarded for it, instead of being prosecuted. Wake Up America. Hussein Obama is
    evil and is well on his way of transforming America.  The Obama Regime will not
    protect Patriotic Americans because they see us as the enemy."

    think that Loretta Lynch looks like Obama in drag?

  content: '"Terror bride used fake address on visa application; State Dept. had no
    idea, but reporter finds it in hours" But no problem with letting in thousands
    more Muslims from around the World, including Syria. This is an invasion. Those
    in power who support this invasion is guilty of treason. The problem is who is
    going to enforce their violation to their oath of office when Loretta Lynch of
    the Obama Regime is one of them?'

  content: If you see something, say something, unless they are Muslims, then don't
    say anything for fear of being called a bigot! The neighbors of these jihadists
    in San Bernardino saw suspicious activity going on in the jihadist&rsquo; garage
    but did not say anything for fear of being called racist. Welcome to ObamaNation!
    I point out to you the Muslim activist, Ahmed Muhamed of Irving, Texas brought
    a hoax bomb to school and was praised and rewarded for it, instead of being prosecuted.
    Hussein Obama did not stand with the school and law enforcement; instead Obama
    mocked and demonized them and praised the Muslim activist. Obama then invited
    Ahmed Muhamed to the White House. Ahmed was made a celebrity by leftists. CEO&rsquo;s
    from Facebook and Google invited him to their corporate headquarters. Commie Deblasio
    of New York gave him the royal treatment, as did many others. So, the message
    that was sent to the American people was/is If you see something, say something,
    unless they are Muslims and that is what is happening.

<blockquote>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important that as we again talk about the importance of free speech we make it clear that actions predicated on violent talk are not America," said Lynch. "They are not who we are, they are not what we do, and <strong>they will be prosecuted</strong>.&rdquo; (source: <a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/1593/loretta-lynch-vows-prosecute-those-who-use-anti-james-barrett" target="_blank">Daily Wire</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Take a slide on the slippery slope.</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday I warned that the<a href="http://wp.me/p3daxv-4sF"> PC Police will soon call for summary incarceration</a> of anyone who violates the rules of their nationwide &ldquo;safe space.&rdquo; Today, we see that US Attorney General Loretta Lynch has vowed to do jus that.</p>
<p>Lynch told a Muslim group that <strong>she will prosecute people who say or write anything she considers &ldquo;predicated on violence.&rdquo;</strong> In other words, she will subvert the First Amendment.</p>
<p>What constitutes &ldquo;predicated on violence?&rdquo; Who knows.</p>
<p>The narcissistic crybabies at <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/11/09/hysterical-yale-student-embarrasses-herself-on-video/">Mizzou and Yale </a>consider any speech they don&rsquo;t want to hear &ldquo;violent,&rdquo; including &ldquo;clean your room&rdquo; and &ldquo;eat your broccoli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly why we have a First Amendment. Because the people in 1789 didn&rsquo;t trust politicians to arbitrarily decide what we can say and think&mdash;only what we can do.</p>
<p>Some will say, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re being unreasonable, Bill. She&rsquo;s talking about inciting violence.&rdquo; No, she&rsquo;s not. She&rsquo;s talking about speech that&rsquo;s predicated upon violence. <strong>Everything I&rsquo;ve written about the San Bernardino Muslim Massacre was predicated on violence,</strong> was it not? (Absent the violence, there&rsquo;s no story.)</p>
<p>And Ms. Lynch limits her prosecution of writers and speakers to those who write and say things Muslims don&rsquo;t like. <strong>Is she prosecuting Muslims who call for jihad in America? No.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exaggerating to say that I can go to jail if this post irritates a Muslim. It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say Christians and Jews are being punished for Muslim terror. <strong>Loretta Lynch and her merry mob of bubblemakers are turning the DoJ into the Department of Jihad.</strong></p>
<p>Here's former Congressman Joe Walsh's response to the Lynch Mob:</p>

<blockquote><p>Attorney General Loretta Lynch Monday appeared to recalibrate remarks she made last week that suggested the Justice Department could investigate speech deemed hostile towards Muslims.</p>
<p>"Of course, we prosecute deeds and not words," she said at a press conference Monday to announce an unrelated civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department.</p>
<p>Some conservatives criticized Lynch for her comments to a Muslim civil rights group, where she lamented "the ability of people to issue hateful speech of all types from the anonymity of a screen."</p></blockquote>
