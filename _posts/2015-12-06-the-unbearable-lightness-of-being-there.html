<blockquote><p>People tell us who they are, but we ignore it. Because we want them to be what&nbsp;we we want them to be.</p>
<p>--Don Draper, Mad Men</p></blockquote>
<p>President Obama used his third Oval Office address in seven years to say "Honey, I shrunk the country." (I know--third metaphor.)</p>
<p>No other way to put it. Tonight America and the world witnessed <strong>a man reduced to his feeblest worst</strong>, an imposter posing as an American President, a child in a grown-up's suit. <strong>Obama is&nbsp;Chance the gardener</strong>--a simpleton with a simplistic, childish worldview.</p>
<p>Obama told us his worldview in 2008, but we didn't listen. We made him what we wanted him to be. (I'm using "we" to represent the American electorate--not necessarily the reader of this blog.)</p>
<p>Want to know why gun sales are setting records? It's not because of terrorism or crime, both of which have exploded on Obama's watch. <strong>People are buying guns because the government has lost control.</strong></p>
<p>More damning, Barack Obama&nbsp;<em>chose</em>&nbsp;to lose control. The Paris attacks, the San Bernardino massacre--these are Obama's policies played out in real life, like a horror movie that breaks the fourth wall.</p>
<p>I'm not saying he's a Muslim or an ISIS sympathizer. I am saying he sought to diminish America's stature in the world. <strong>He campaigned on putting America in its place.</strong> He believed that America was no more virtuous that any other country, including Nazi Germany and the Ayatollah's Iran.</p>
<p>And, as Reverend Jeremiah Wright would say,<strong> Obama's chickens have come to roost.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>With US investigators increasingly convinced Farook and Malik were only beginning their planned mayhem when gunned down by heroic San Bernardino cops, it's pretty clear that the world needs a virtuous nation at its head.</p>
<p>For nearly 100 years, that virtuous nation was the United States of America. But Barack Obama stopped all that. <strong>He thought the perpetrators of the Arab Spring were America's equals in virtue.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>They were not.</p>
<p>The next election will be a referendum on America's place in the world. Are we just a punching bag for terrorists? Or are we the shining city on a hill with a perpetual rendezvous with destiny?</p>
<p>Vote wisely, my friend. You didn't the last two times.</p>
