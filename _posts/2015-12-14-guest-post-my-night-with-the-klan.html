<p><em>Editor's Note: This article from 1992 tells a remarkable story of one man's brave visit to a KKK rally. The stories Lee present serve a cautionary tale: human nature abhors a vacuum. When leaders fail to lead, humanity cries out. And, to paraphrase Steven King, who knows what dread thing will answer.</em></p>
<p><em>Bear in mind that this rally took place in 1992. George H.W. Bush was president, and the Golden Age of Ronald Reagan was only 3 years in the past. The United States had just won the Cold War and trounced Saddam Hussein in Operation Desert Storm. The World Wide Web was a year from launching. Email was new--on CompuServe or Prodigy or the upstart AOL. The US economy was emerging from short but deep recession.</em></p>

<h2>My Night With the Klan</h2>
<p>by Lee A. Presser</p>
<p>There was a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan on Saturday, September 12, 1992, in the farm country of Madison County in Southwest Illinois.&nbsp; It was said that it had been thirty years since the last such open gathering in the Madison County.&nbsp; The meeting was well organized, enthusiastic, and very secure. &nbsp;Local, county, state, and federal officers were encamped across the street and fanned out in cars for miles around.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the farmhouse gate were two men in Klan uniforms holding homemade shields painted with a large cross and a white power symbol.&nbsp; Flags and KKK banners boldly adorned the chain link fence. &nbsp;Inside the fence were other uniformed men.&nbsp; Some were wearing headsets with boom mikes so they could talk to other Klan security personnel. The Klan had organized for its own protection.&nbsp; A cadre of newspaper and TV representatives were gathered across the road but stood separated from a large contingent of police.</p>
<p>I first learned about this extraordinary meeting the previous week from a local newspaper article.&nbsp; Once the &ldquo;story&rdquo; was out, all of the St. Louis region newspapers picked it up.&nbsp; Their reports were quickly followed up by TV and radio news.&nbsp; Word traveled throughout the region.&nbsp; The Klan was to reemerge into public view after a generation of being invisible.</p>
<p>The Madison County Sheriff, a good cop, insisted that this was going to be a peaceful event and closely watched. &nbsp;He spoke to the press and asked citizens to stay away from the meeting.&nbsp; He notified everyone of a newly created &ldquo;no-parking zone&rdquo; which would extend a mile round the site. &nbsp;He warned those who traveled to the meeting that their auto license plate numbers would be written down.&nbsp; Then he did his duty as an officer of the law and let the public meeting go forward.&nbsp; The Klan would have its public say.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM, when I left my house, I was very nervous. &nbsp;I feared meeting Klansmen.&nbsp; Who knew how they would behave.&nbsp; Would they be physically dangerous?&nbsp; Would they attack me as a police spy?&nbsp; I did not know.&nbsp; My other fear was about getting to this rural meeting area, finding parking, and getting past all the partisan players by 6:00 PM to hear the Klan&rsquo;s speakers for myself.&nbsp; It was going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed upon my approach to Torch Club Road were three police vehicles at the intersection.&nbsp; A reporter friend of mine was out of his car and having strong words with one of the police officers.&nbsp; I kept driving.</p>
<p>I turned left and drove down the street looking for the address noted in the newspaper.&nbsp; A sign on one property read &ldquo;Parking $5.&rdquo;&nbsp; Driving further down Torch Club Road another sign announced, &ldquo;Rally Here.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a farmhouse with a very large field around the property.&nbsp; Inside the fenced yard, a large crowd was already gathered.&nbsp; Most of the people I saw in the front yard were wearing T-shirts with KKK or white power logos.&nbsp; KKK guest parking was available on the property.&nbsp; I continued driving past the farm house. &nbsp;On the other side of the street was an army of police.&nbsp; Freshly planted &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; signs forced me to keep going.</p>
<p>Far down this country road, there was a residential street on the right.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a sheriff's deputy parked at the corner told me there was no parking allowed on that road, either.&nbsp; Already a long way from the rally, I turned around and headed back.&nbsp; This time, near the rally farmhouse, I spotted a clearing between some trees.&nbsp; It was off the road, down in a ditch.&nbsp; I took a chance that I would not get towed.</p>
<p>As I approached the rally site on foot, my stomach tightened.&nbsp; I was going to have to walk past the uniformed men with their decorated shields, through their gate, and into a crowd attending a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>On the other side of the road were reporters I recognized and who recognized me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you going in?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I answered yes, I want to see and hear the event for myself.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that what writers were supposed to do.&nbsp; Walking closer to a group of reporters who were huddling together, I asked them if they were going into the event.&nbsp; All I got in response was a couple of shrugs and a terse &ldquo;maybe later.&rdquo;&nbsp; How those reporters were going to know what to report was a mystery to me.&nbsp; They were going to file reports about what they saw only from an exterior point of view.&nbsp; Had they gone inside they would have been able learn what the crowd was thinking, feeling, and maybe learn why they were there in attendance.</p>
<p>It was time for me to cross the street.&nbsp; I turned from my reporter friends, took a deep breath, and walked toward the entrance gate. &nbsp;Walking, I watched the gate guards closely. &nbsp;I smiled. &nbsp;As I approached and to my surprise, they let me walk right by.&nbsp; No questions were asked.</p>
<p>Inside the yard I was warmly greeted by several people. &nbsp;Roaming about I spotted a literature table on the other side of this large fenced in area. &nbsp;(I almost wrote the word 'compound' in the previous sentence but remembered it was someone's backyard.)&nbsp; When I approached the literature table a very handsome woman greeted me and offered brochures and fliers.&nbsp; I picked up a copy of the &ldquo;White Patriot&rdquo; the &ldquo;Worldwide Voice of the Aryan People.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s banner headline exclaimed, &ldquo;THIS IS THE KLAN.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stories about &ldquo;Today's Klan&rdquo; filled the publication.</p>
<p>A dozen youngsters were running and playing in an adjacent separately fenced area further away from the house.&nbsp; Mom&rsquo;s sat nearby.&nbsp; A grill was fired up near the literature table, cooking hamburgers which cost a $1.00.&nbsp; Sodas were fifty cents.&nbsp; There was a big hungry crowd waiting in line.</p>
<p>People were busily talking in groups just like at any other outdoor event.&nbsp; By my count there were about 125 people in attendance.&nbsp; At least a third were under 21 years old.&nbsp; Another third were 21 to 35 years old. The relative youth of the crowd surprised me. &nbsp;There was one man in a suit.&nbsp; Probably he was the featured speaker mentioned in the press release.</p>
<p>Excusing myself from the lady at the literature table, I wandered toward a group of guys in their mid-twenties talking together, stopping close enough to hear what they had to say.&nbsp; One was talking about negative encounters with the police and others concurred with personal stories about being harassed by the &ldquo;feds&rdquo; (FBI) and local police. &nbsp;All of them keep glancing across the street at the police.&nbsp; One said to the others &ldquo;the feds had been grabbing letters out of a certain residential mailbox&rdquo; and to prove it he and some other friends had put &ldquo;interesting mail&rdquo; into that box and later &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; it was gone and not with the mailman.&nbsp; &nbsp;An anxious looking fellow standing with that group fiddled with what looked like a small wooden spear tipped with a metal spike attached by chain to his leather belt.&nbsp; One of the young men declared they should be on the lookout for police infiltrators inside the fence.&nbsp; Yet, they drew me into their conversation.&nbsp; As we talked I noticed across the street, near the reporters, student protesters had arrived and were lining up.&nbsp; Their signs and banners were raised in protest against the Klan meeting.&nbsp; During my continuing conversation with the young men, I discovered that some had driven many hours to be at this meeting.&nbsp; One said he came from DeKalb. &nbsp;Another said he&rsquo;d come up from Texas.&nbsp; All said in recent years they had been to other meetings just like this one.</p>
<p>Moving from that group, I met another man from Texas, his lovely wife, and their beautiful children. &nbsp;The two kids darted in and out as we conversed. &nbsp;These Texans had also been other meetings like this one and were pleased to be at this one. &nbsp;They said that the featured speaker, Thomas Robb (the man in the suit), was very inspirational.&nbsp; Mr. Robb is a minister from Arkansas, I was told. &nbsp;He was also a candidate for the Arkansas state legislature.&nbsp; As I spoke to this couple, around us were other conversations about family and work.&nbsp; This Klan event was a social occasion, much like a company picnic.&nbsp; Whole families had come.&nbsp; Wives met and chatted with other wives.&nbsp; Kids met kids and they played together. &nbsp;The people were festive.&nbsp; They ate burgers and drank cold drinks. &nbsp;Mothers fed their babies.</p>
