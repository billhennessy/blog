<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll build a wall . . . and I&rsquo;ll make Donald Trump pay for it.&rdquo; &mdash; Ted Cruz</p>
<p>Line of the night in the last GOP Presidential debate of the year of our Lord two thousand and fifteen.</p>
<p>This was the most telling debate of all. And it shouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
<p>The more you know about anything, the less you like it. That&rsquo;s a scientific fact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why&nbsp;the "love of your life" when you were dating is the "lump on the couch" 20 years later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Keurig coffee maker you "had to have" last Christmas isn&rsquo;t your first love this Christmas.</p>
<p>The more we know, the less we like.</p>
<p>Grassroots people want more debates among their candidates. And more debates kill their candidates&rsquo; chances.</p>
<p>The Democrats air their few debates on Fridays and Saturdays because they know no one will watch them. They don&rsquo;t want to be seen.</p>
<p>Democrats know how the brain works. Republicans don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Donald Trump understands this. He actually says very little.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Try this.</p>
<p>[yop_poll id="5"]</p>
<p>[yop_poll id="7"]</p>
<p>[yop_poll id="8"]</p>
<p>[yop_poll id="9"]</p>
<p>More information about something &nbsp;only increases the likelihood you won't like something about it. That's why presidents usually leave office less popular than they entered office.</p>
<p>One hundred debates will expose something you don't like about your favorite candidate.</p>
<p>I'm predicting that candy is more popular than moist, salty, peppermint candy because the people who like moist, salty, peppermint candy must be a subset of people who like candy.</p>
<p>The more information you have, the more likely you object to something. It's pure logic.</p>
<p>These debates are not helping the GOP.</p>
<p>But anyone on the stage tonight would do more to advance the interests of Americans and Western Civilization than any Democrat would. And for that I love the GOP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
