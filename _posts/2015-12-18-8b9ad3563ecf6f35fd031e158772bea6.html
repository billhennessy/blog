<p>This is about  a new Global Medical Preventiv Reseach Charity   MPRC  in need of donations<br />
This charity will  support local medical professionals ( human Dr and Veterinarians)<br />
who have got in touch with local diseases and started medical research to find the cause,how to treat  and prevent the disease<br />
Look at the web page   http://www.mprcharity.simplesite.com          for Donation information<br />
If you donate to this charity  you become a member of this  MPRCharity<br />
We apreciate any kind of donation that support  this preventive medical reseach Charity<br />
This charity was introduced  from help request from a veterinarian who had got in touch with sick horses in Ghana and  10-20 horses had died in Ghana between October to marc for 10 years with similar signs and the authorities did not care. We supported him for analyse  expensies  and he found the cause  a mycotoxin in the food  that can be prevented.<br />
This charity have supported a medical research to find a new method of Buruli  Ulcer treatment to reduce the need of amputations of legs / arms on kids in tropical climate, but we have not had money to support the production of the new medicin for the wound treatment yet.  Another area are  research to find Xenoestrogens behind reproductive organ diseases as fibroids and breast cancer in ghana<br />
And we need donations now to continue the support of Medical Preventive Reseach<br />
