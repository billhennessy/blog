    Once again I will copy and paste my comments and questions because those are questions that need to be addressed and why rewrite what was written.
    The problems I have with Eric Greitens are as follows: Why did Greitens not run as a Conservative Democrat against the leftist lib Chris Koster when he was a registered Democrat until he decided to run for governor? Greitens charitable group is affiliated with the Clinton Global Initiative. Why would he want to be involved in that criminal enterprise? He sits on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation a George Soros funded group. Soros is the man behind Hussein Obama. Soros took advantage of the 2009 Stimulus getting richer off the backs of the taxpayers. Soros is an evil man. So why does Greitens want to be affiliated with him?  Greitens also believes in the hoax of climate change and there is video of that. Greitens supports a World Government. Then there are other questions that should be answered which are: what is his position on immigration; on the refugee/migrant situation; and what is his position on Common Core? Greitens claims to be Conservative.  I say prove it.  His history shows he is not Conservative. So prior to him changing his affiliation from Democrat to Republican to run for governor, what did he do that was &ldquo;Conservative?&rdquo; I am asking for people to check him out further and question him on his history and affiliations.

    I have. I know you have differences with Senator Lamping, but John was one of the most principled conservative Senators Missouri has seen in a decade. Lamping believes Greitens is a conservative reformer. Jim Lembke is another principled conservative who's backing Greitens. So is Sarah Steelman.

    I've said my support for Greitens is a leap of faith. I understand that some people can't take that leap. Your points are valid and you have been fair. Others who actively oppose Greitens use half-truths and innuendo as if they're paid to bring him down.

    I am all for a reformer governor who can't be bought, who is pro-life, pro-veteran, and solution oriented. Missouri needs to grow again.

    Thanks, Greg,   For writing. And happy new year. This will be one to remember.

  content: Bill, I would have been the most Conservative in the Missouri Senate if
    I was given the chance; however my campaign was sabotaged by John Lamping and
    the Republican Establishment when they cut a deal with demonRAT Ryan McKenna.
    So, I would not consider Lamping to be principled, therefore I would not put much
    credence on Lamping&rsquo;s opinion of Greitens. As for others, including you,
    who support Greitens need to have the things I have brought up answered, because
    from where I see it, Greitens is not who you think he is. I do not believe Greitens
    to be the choice if you are looking for someone who cannot be bought when he has
    teamed up with the likes of George Soros and the Clinton&rsquo;s. Remember Koster
    was considered a Conservative Republican until he switched to the DemonRATS. As
    for your leap of faith, be careful that leap is not over a cliff. Take care. And
    I hope it is a Happy New Year with the upcoming election.

  content: Bill - I would caution anyone not to put too much "faith" in the hands
    and opinions of ambitious politicians, no matter how "conservative they purport
    to be.  In other words, "look before you leap".  The saying "you're known by the
    company you keep" should maybe applied here.  I'm not sure but I certainly wouldn't
    hang my support on the endorsement of ANY career politician(s).

<p>A couple weeks ago, the blog Progressives Today&nbsp;ran an attack piece&nbsp;on <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/07/14/eric-greitens-shocking-revelation-could-shatter-peoples-faith/">Eric Greitens</a> for two of his donors (<a href="http://www.progressivestoday.com/greitens-funded-by-enviro-nut-brother-and-transgender-cousin-of-obama-official/">link</a>). The piece generated of lot angst and fury on the right side of social media.</p>
<p><strong>Turns out the story was pretty&nbsp;shoddy journalism.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Progressives Today didn't bother to look at the Pritzkers' other donations or the military museum they founded. If they had, they'd know that Jennifer N. Pritzker (formerly James N. Pritzker) of Chicago distributes donations pretty equally between parties, while Jennifer's cousin Anthony Pritzker donates freely and exclusively to Republicans, at least since 2012.</p>

<dd class="wp-caption-dd">Election Cycle 2016 Donation of&nbsp;Anthony Pritzker of Santa Monica, CA via <a href="http://www.campaignmoney.com/advanced.asp?pg=2&amp;searchtype=contributors&amp;cycle1=16&amp;lname=Pritzker&amp;fname=&amp;work=&amp;occup=&amp;zipcodes=&amp;fdate=&amp;tdate=&amp;state=&amp;cycle2=16&amp;cmtetype=&amp;cmtename=&amp;cmteorg=&amp;igc=&amp;cmteparty=&amp;cycle3=16&amp;cndoffice=&amp;cndtype=&amp;cndlname=&amp;cndfname=&amp;cndstate=&amp;cndparty=&amp;orderby=&amp;reccnt=83&amp;recamt=1004123">CampaignMoney</a></dd>

<p>While I'm not too hip on some of the Republicans on the list, <strong>this is not the campaign contribution list of a "clear leftist agenda" as the blog states. </strong></p>
<p>Moreover, Jennifer Pritzker does a lot of work preserving <strong>military history, artifacts, and sites</strong>. <a href="http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/">The Pritzker Military Museum and Library</a> in Chicago is one example.</p>
<p>While we're at it, the <a href="http://www.tawanifoundation.org/">Tawani Foundation</a> looks pretty hardcore pro-military, too.</p>
<p>The Progressives Today blogger asked this question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why would a family with a clear leftist agenda fund a &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; and why any &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; accept their money?</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on the <strong>Pritzkers' work in preserving military history and supporting citizen soldiers</strong>, it makes perfect sense that they would support the political campaign of a famous Navy SEAL who founded a remarkable veterans organization.&nbsp;<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/07/14/eric-greitens-shocking-revelation-could-shatter-peoples-faith/"><strong>Eric Greitens sort of fits the mold of "citizen soldier" to a T</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, being&nbsp;a generous&nbsp;Republican donor, it makes sense that Anthony Pritzker would support Republican Eric Greitens.</p>
<p>Why would Greitens accept donations from pro-military, Republican donors?</p>
<p>Hell, why wouldn't he?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
