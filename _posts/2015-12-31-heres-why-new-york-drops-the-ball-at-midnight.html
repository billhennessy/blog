<p>Once upon a time, in the days of sundials and pendulum clocks, people needed a way to&nbsp;<em>agree</em> on the time. For instance, if my watch says 11:13 and your watch says 1:32, who's right?</p>
<p>One way to coordinate time in a city or a sea port was a time ball placed somewhere highly visible. People could use the ball to set their pocket watches, and use their pocket watches to set their other clocks.</p>
<p>Here's how time balls worked, <a href="http://www.cincinnatiobservatory.org/media/documents/How_Time_Balls_Worked.pdf">from the Cincinnati Observatory</a>:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Precisely 15 minutes before noon, the ball was raised, using a windlass, to half-mast, and, at 5 minutes to noon, the ball was lifted to the top, providing viewers with 15-minute and 5-minute advance notices. At astronomical noon in Cincinnati, the ball dropped free- fall style. A hand-operated Prony friction brake allowed the ball to stop gently before the end of its 30-foot travel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Set your pocket watch to precisely noon with the stem out. When the ball drops, drop the stem. If you kept your watch wound, you'd have fairly accurate time for a few months.</p>
<p>New York City used the ball-drop method of time coordination to ring the new year and to promote&nbsp;Edison's lightbulbs. Since the whole point of the ball drop was visibility, there'd be no value to a midnight ball-drop unless the ball was lighted.</p>
<p>The first NYC New Year's ball was covered in 100 lightbulbs. You could set your watch by it.</p>
