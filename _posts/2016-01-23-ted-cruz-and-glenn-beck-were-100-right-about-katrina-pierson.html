  content: Excellent post.  The only criticism I'd make is to say that Mr. Hennessy
    should check his spelling before writing the names of Biblical books.  It "Revelation"
    not "Revelations."

  content: "Great article  This is a great video by a grassroots Trump supporter in
    reaction to the National Review article.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ6XdwGt7Ls&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n#Trump2016\n\nJanuary
    20, 2016\nDebbie Dooley\n678-761-6725\n\nAs a co-founder of the national tea party
    movement, I am deeply concerned about the direction our country is moving in.
    \ We need a bold, strong leader that will be a fighter for conservative values
    to halt the slide into a path of destruction of the principles of liberty our
    nation was founded on.\n\nDonald Trump has a proven track record of winning and
    job creation. He is not accepting big donations from Wall Street or big banks,
    so he will not be indebted to big donors. We can count on Mr. Trump to fight for
    the best interests of Main Street &ndash; not Wall Street. He demonstrated this
    when he came out very strongly against the ObamaTrade agreement at a time when
    other candidates were supporting it.  Mr. Trump will fight for American jobs.
    \ He strongly believes in American exceptionalism and will put American interests
    first.\n\nI truly believe that Donald Trump is the champion conservatives have
    been clamoring for since Reagan left office. He has already defeated the Republican
    establishment and the main stream media. Mr. Trump has set the dialogue for the
    2016 Republican Presidential Primary.  Imagine the conservative victories a Trump
    Administration would hold.\n\nPlease join me and support a conservative winner
    in Donald Trump. I trust my beloved grandson&rsquo;s future to him.\n\nBIO\n\nDebbie
    Dooley has been a grassroots activist since 1976 fighting for conservative values
    and has been actively involved as a volunteer in over 40 political campaigns and
    grassroots initiatives. She was elected a delegate to the Republican National
    Convention in 1988 and 2012.\n\nDooley is one of the 22 national founders of the
    tea party movement.  She is currently Chairman of Atlanta Tea Party and was one
    of the speakers at the 9-12-2009 March on D.C. \nShe has served on the Board of
    Directors of Tea Party Patriots since October of 2009.\n\nShe has been very successful
    in bringing both conservative and progressive groups together in coalitions to
    support policy both sides agree on. Dooley strongly believes there are some issues
    that should not be partisan.\n\nDooley formed both Green Tea Coalition and Conservatives
    for Energy Freedom as vehicles to fight for free market principles in energy and
    true energy choice. She believes in removing the government erected barriers of
    monopolies that prohibit true free market choice and fights for clean energy like
    solar, wind and biofuels among others as a means of providing that choice.  Dooley
    believes when it comes to energy, we need to be deregulating &ndash; not regulating.\n\nDebbie
    has appeared numerous times on national print and television media outlets including
    The New Yorker, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Forbes, Fox News, MSNBC, L.A.
    Times, N.Y. Times, U.K. Guardian, and other international publications. Her work
    with solar choice has been featured in several documentaries.\n\nDooley gave one
    of the Keynote addresses at the Bloomberg Energy Finance summit in New York City
    last Spring.\n\nDebbie currently resides in Buford, Georgia. Her proudest accomplishment
    is being a grandmother to 7-year-old grandson Ayden."

  content: "Well perhaps you should forward your advice to Donald Trump and his staff!
    Where was your outrage when Trump and his spokespeople claimed that Ted Cruz was
    WORSE than Hilary Clinton? Were is your outrage against Trump and his staff when
    they attacked Mr. Cruz for his loans? They said he was beholden to Goldman Saks
    and Citibank for taking out loans to finance his campaign.Yet, Mr. Trump has taken
    out business loans from these very same institutions yet he is somehow exempt
    from this same criticism? Trump stated Mr. Cruz is worse than Hilary Clinton because
    he filed the wrong forms to disclose this information! Worse than Clinton who
    broke the law regarding her government emails, allowed our Ambassador and other
    men to die in Benghazi, covered up and harassed women whom Bill Clinton sexually
    assaulted, Whitewater and countless other scandals and illegal actives!  Can you
    honestly support a man who spews this kind of rhetoric and lies?\nLet's not forget
    how he has attacked Carly Fiorina and her business skill. These attacks coming
    from a man who has declared bankruptcy four times after amassing huge debts. A
    man who said he profited and used the government system to leave shareholders,
    small business owners and workers unpaid and in many cases financially devastated
    because of his poor business skills.  Yet we shouldn't point out the flaws of
    Mr. Trump or of his staff?\n  I understand many are angry with the establishment
    politicians, pundits and lobbyist. What I can not understand is how many in the
    conservative and Tea party movement can turn a blind eye to Mr. Trump's liberal
    background and his very own words about embracing the establishment. Please DO
    NOT use President Reagan's conversion from the Democratic party to the Republican
    party as an argument. President Reagan was a converted conservative for many years
    before he sought the office of President. Mr. Trump is NO RONALD REAGAN! Trying
    to cast him as such is an insult not only to President Reagan, but to those of
    us who supported and loved him. President Reagan had many detractors both in and
    out of his party. He never resorted to the petty name calling and mud slinging
    which Trump does on a daily basis. President Reagan had a record and history to
    support his conservative values, Trump does not. President Reagan used truth,
    integrity, humor and firmness of conviction to spread his message to the people.
    Mr. Trump is the exact opposite.he treats his opponents and critics with open
    hostility, spews hate and lies, and has an over abundant amount of arrogance and
    hubris. \nI had always believed that being conservative meant one had a belief
    in smaller limited government, restoring and preserving the rights of individuals
    and the Constitution, having a understanding that an balanced budget and vast
    federal debt was destructive to the nation and her people. Yet, many individuals
    within the conservative movement have shed these values and beliefs to support
    Mr. Trump. Mr Trump supports Eminent Domain, Universal Healthcare, has voiced
    support for continued funding of planned parenthood, ethanol subsidies,  a form
    of amnesty, and has said he would use executive orders to enact his wises. How
    is this different from Obama, the democrats or the establishment Republicans?
    In fact, many establishment Republicans are now backing Mr. Trump because they
    feel he will cut deals and work with them unlike Mr. Cruz. Ted Cruz has a record
    and history of voting and maintaining his conservative values. But some of the
    conservative voices that I have respected i the past are now jumping on the Trump
    bandwagon. Why? How can they turn a blind eye to Mr. Trump's words and history?
    \nI have heard stories that sites like Brietbart, Drudge and Gateway Pundit are
    receiving funding from Mr. Trump to support their sites in return for favorable
    coverage. I hope this is untrue. If it is true then they are no better than lobbyist
    who sell their souls for profit and power. I question if Sarah Palin has been
    offered a cabinet position for her support? Has politics and power corrupted every
    facet of conservatism? I find it so hypocritical of you and others who cry \"fowl\"
    and \"unfair\" when Mr. Trump and his staff are help under a microscope or their
    record and history attacked. Yet daily, on social media, blog sites and press,
    Mr. Cruz, his supporters, and people like me are attacked, vilified, threatened
    and have hate and personal attacks leveled at us. So, in your very words Mr. Hennessy,
    find a way for you and Mr. Trump's supporters to elevate their candidate without
    the personal destruction I and other conservatives have had by Mr. Trump's supporters."

  content: I don't trust anyone who supports Trump.  By supporting Trump Katrina has
    bought into the lie that celebrity is more important than character.  Trump is
    a self-absorbed, arrogant egomaniac.  If that is who Katrina chooses to support
    then she is just as bad as Trump himself.

  content: "Trump has had all the right talking points and I have said any times .
    . .  he definitely has someone around that has their finger on the pulse of THE
    PEOPLE -  their concerns, frustrations, fears, anger, etc.  Sounds like Katrina
    Pierson is that person. (Tea Party bona fides and all.)  Trump was wise to hire
    her (female, bi-racial, political, outspoken, activist ) and it's up to us to
    decide if his motive for hiring Pierson (11/15)  was a shrewd calculation to capture
    the vote of the Tea Party crowd or a \"good fit\" of political ideology.  Pretty
    much the same for Pierson -  she became Trump's spokesperson because:\n\nA)  She
    truly believes in him. \nB)  It's a great paycheck\nC)  Exposure for political
    future/job\nC)  All the above\n\nFor me . . . Trump has ended up in my ELIMINATED
    pile  - (many of the reasons were addressed by shadowsnomore).  It's an on going
    process of daily weirdness."

  content: It is sad that things have come to this, where conservatives, tea party-ers
    and GOP are all attacking each other and some are even resorting to twisting the
    truth to try to gain points. We need to pull together to win this upcoming election,
    regardless of which candidate wins the nomination. Let's not slash each other
    in the process of trying to assist our favored candidate. What's the point of
    winning if we lose our decency, civility and integrity in the process? Somebody
    should remind Glenn Beck about that...

<p><em>UPDATE: Originally I mentioned "apparently fake twitter account." I've learned (after lots of research) that I was mistaken. I've removed that statement. Please continue reading. My carelessness was&nbsp;completely my own.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I agree with Ted Cruz. And welcome <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/23/2846855/">Big Government readers</a>.</p>
<p>Senator Cruz said,&nbsp;"<strong>Katrina Pierson is an utterly fearless principled conservative</strong>."</p>
<p>That was just two years ago. Katrina Pierson was challenging Pete Sessions for Congress.</p>
<p>I also agree with Ted's dad, Rafael Cruz, who said of Katrina, "<strong>She&rsquo;s a strict constitutionalist</strong>. She&rsquo;s a <strong>strong conservative</strong> and she wants to do what&rsquo;s right."</p>
<p>I also agree with <strong>Glenn Beck</strong>&nbsp;who introduced his radio audience to Katrina this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Katrina Pierson is running against Congressman Pete Sessions here in Texas&hellip; To call Pete a massive disappointment is a massive understatement. And you should get to know Katrina. Ted Cruz, who doesn&rsquo;t throw these things around lightly, called her an utterly fearless principled conservative, which I think is about the highest praise you could get from Ted Cruz. (<a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/2014/02/12/glenn-talks-to-congressional-candidate-katrina-pierson-about-taking-on-the-establishment-gop/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.glennbeck.com/2014/02/12/glenn-talks-to-congressional-candidate-katrina-pierson-about-taking-on-the-establishment-gop/">Source: glennbeck.com</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>I even agree with (in carefully measured doses) <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/the_tea_party_is_weak_in_texas_katrina_pierson_is_the_best_the_grassroots.html">this Dave Weigel story in Slate from 2014</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span><span></span>Pierson&rsquo;s claim on the Cruz brand is more intimate. Nanoseconds after she announced for Congress, she was endorsed by&nbsp;</span><a href="http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2014/02/pierson-calls-sessions-shifty-on-obamacare.html/" target="_blank"><span></span>FreedomWorks</a><span><span></span>, the D.C.-based Tea Party powerhouse. FreedomWorks has warred for its own Cruz pixie dust&mdash;when Sen. John Cornyn&rsquo;s campaign&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/freedomworks-corrects-inaccurate-cornyn-campaign-s" target="_blank">hired</a><span><span></span>&nbsp;the group&rsquo;s old grassroots coordinator Brendan Steinhauser, Freedom</span><span>Works insisted that he &ldquo;was not in charge of our political efforts in 2010 or 2012.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><span></span>Steinha</span><span><span></span>user strayed, at least in the view of FreedomWorks. Pierson did not. <strong><span></span>She&rsquo;s a pure Tea Partier</strong>, one of the shrinking group of conservative activists who gained unimagined political stardom, compared to the average freshman congressman, thanks to media interest in the movement, especially from Fox News. She&rsquo;s biracial, which she insists will drive the left batty when (never &ldquo;if&rdquo;) she wins. &ldquo;You could call me a racist,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Good luck with&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>! You could say I&rsquo;m out there pushing the war on women. Good luck with that, too.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Dave Weigel covered the Tea Party movement for Washington Post and Slate since its earliest days. He knows who was there.</p>
<p>[Tweet "Senator Cruz said, &ldquo;Katrina Pierson is an utterly fearless principled conservative.&rdquo;"]</p>
<h3>I Figured She Was a&nbsp;Prima Donna</h3>
<p><span></span>I've known Katrina Pierson since 2009, but I first met her in 2010. She and many Tea Partiers from Texas came to St. Louis for the September 12 event under the Arch. I knew Katrina was a star of the Texas tea parties, and I expected her to be a prima donna. But I quickly learned otherwise.</p>
<p>It was hot. I was playing host by&nbsp;escorting&nbsp;a group of VIPs on foot, about eight people in total. We had a few&nbsp;of blocks to go. The women were mostly in heels walking on rough pavement in downtown St. Louis.</p>
<p>A big, black SUV came along, recognized a few of the faces, and offered a ride. "I have room for six," the driver said.</p>
<p>Some of us looked around. A few people simply jumped into the SUV. Katrina said, "It's okay. I can walk." So I walked with her. (I was a host.) I believe one other gentleman walked with us. Prima donnas&nbsp;don't give up an SUV ride.</p>
<p><span></span>That simple act of humility when no one of consequence was a round to see it told me a lot&nbsp;about Katrina.</p>
<h3>Conservatives Gone Wild</h3>
<p>Today, a conservative blogger pieced together snippets of some of Katrina's past statements to build a case that Katrina is actually a radical leftist. &nbsp;In elections, even good people often lose their minds.</p>
<p>But Glenn Beck took to Facebook to pile on Katrina. Without bothering to check the validity or context of the piece, he labelled Pierson "dangerous." And that's a shame, because Glenn once had something to offer. Like when he gave Katrina a platform in her 2014 race against the "disappointing" Pete Sessions.</p>
<p><span></span>As blogger Dan Riehl points out on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><span></span>Come on foks, going after Katrina Pierson like she's Huma Abedin is small minded and pointless. Ur venting anger not accomplishing anything</p>
<p><span></span>&mdash; DanRiehl (@DanRiehl) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanRiehl/status/691056423585775616">January 24, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>Yep. Especially when Glenn Beck attacks her. Remember, Glenn is the same guy who, in 2009, said that <strong>he would have voted for Hillary Clinton over John McCain</strong> and that <strong>he expects&nbsp;Barack Obama will be better for the country</strong> than McCain would have been (video below).</p>
<p>Look, I get that elections make good people crazy. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/01/22/trumps-conservative-critics-dont-get-it/">I'll blame it on National Review</a>. And I get that <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/12/22/party-like-its-1992/" target="_blank">conservatives have problems with Trump</a>. But let's try to remember two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be a tomorrow no matter how the Iowa caucuses shake out, and</li>
<li>If there is no tomorrow, Revelation tells us the good guys have won.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span></span>Katrina Pierson really is a pure tea partier, a fierce conservative, and a strict constitutionalist</strong>. She didn't stop being those things when she became Trump's spokesperson anymore than Beck stopped being a conservative when he declared a preference for Hillary and Obama over McCain.</p>
<p><strong>Katrina is a friend and a soldier</strong> in the war on establishment values. <strong>She has lifted me up</strong> and pointed back toward the front in our war <strong>when I've stumbled and felt weak</strong>.</p>
<p>Find a way to elevate Cruz without destroying your sister-in-arms.</p>
