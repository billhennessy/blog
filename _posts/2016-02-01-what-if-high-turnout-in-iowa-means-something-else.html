<p>Reports on Twitter say turnout in Iowa very high.</p>

<p>Were this Colorado, <span></span>high turnnout&nbsp;would mean something else, but it could mean something in Iowa that pundits didn't expect.</p>
<p>This is nothing but my weird speculation, and I am <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/02/01/do-we-owe-obama-an-apology/">the guy who apologized to Obama today</a>. So consider the source.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that high turnout favors Trump. That's based on polling, of course, and turnout models. But turnout models have been wrong before.</p>
<p>[Tweet "Were this Colorado, high turnnout would mean something else"]</p>
<p><span></span>It's also possible that a dark horse like Rand Paul or Ben Carson has supporters who didn't fit the traditional "likely caucuser" models.</p>
<p><span></span>Paul appeals to libertarian-ish folks, especially the young who might have a short voter history. (Not that that would stop <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/01/31/cruzs-epic-facepalm/">the Cruz campaign from citing them with a voting violation</a>.) Eighteen to 24-year-olds might be off the pollsters' radars and turning out for Rand.</p>
<p><span></span>Ben Carson once did exceptionally well with conservative Christians. Again, it's possible that hidden Christians are turning out for Carson the way the turned out for Santorum four years ago.</p>
<p><span></span>I have very few Iowa readers for some reason. Maybe it's my opposition to ethanol subsidies and mandates. If you're in Iowa and you're a new caucaser, I'd love to hear your story in the comments. Please right because it will make us all smarter.</p>
