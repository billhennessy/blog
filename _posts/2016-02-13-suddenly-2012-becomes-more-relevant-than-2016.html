<p>[Stream of consciousness. Please forgive errors and craziness.]</p>
<p>The human brain is very bad at looking to the future.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to imagine a living person not being here. We naturally assume the future will be a linear progression of the recent past.</p>
<p>Then one of five conservative Supreme Court justices dies. And everything's thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>We have only eleven months until a new president takes the oath of office. Those could be the longest months for America since the Civil War.</p>
<p><span></span>Already, Senator Patrick Leahy and President Barack Obama have signaled an intent to replace Scalia with a leftist at any cost. Already, Senato Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Ted Cruz have stated that the next president, not Obama, should fill the seat.</p>
<p>The battle to fill Scalia's Supreme Court seat will likely overshadow the presidential election.</p>
<p><span></span>In practical terms, the Supreme Court is not the final arbiter of the law--it is the final creator of law in the United States. As far back as Marbury v<span></span>. Madison, through Wickard v<span></span>. Filburn and Roe v. Wade, and up to Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court has invented law in the absence--or even in contradiction--of the Constitution's obvious meaning.</p>
<p><span></span>As several conservative justices aged, many of warned of the consequences of a second Obama administration. Romney was no conservative, but a Romney appointee to the court would be exponentially less bad than an Obama appointment.</p>
<p>In that respect, 2012 now becomes more relevant to America's future than 2016. Because, if Obama appoints a replacement for Scalia, the legislature and the executive become mere functionaries of Supreme Court dictates.</p>
<p>If the Senate capitulates to Obama, the best hope for a republican form of government will be a Jacksonian president.</p>
<p>Think the Senate would block it? Maybe not.</p>
<p>Fox News is now discussing the possibility that President Obama may make a recess appointment, eliminating the Senate's power of advice and consent. If that happens, the nation may well shake itself apart.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, 2012 now seems far more relevant to America's future than 2016.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, our thoughts for Antonin Scalia and his family.</p>
<p><strong><span></span>Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, the the mercy of God, rest in peace.&nbsp;</strong></p>
