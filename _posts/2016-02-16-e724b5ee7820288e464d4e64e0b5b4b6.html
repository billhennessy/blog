<p>"Volunteers do not necessarily have the time; they just have the heart."<br />
-- Elizabeth Andrew</p>
<p>Hello Mr. Hennessy,</p>
<p>	My name is Jon Schuessler.  I&rsquo;m writing to you on behalf of an organization called the Missouri Volunteer Movement.  We came across some of your political views online, as well as your accomplishments (go Tea Party!) and were favorably impressed.</p>
<p>	I understand, from your blog, that you want people to "own their lives", to have opportunities as individuals, to choose their own risks and face the consequences honestly.  Government that smothers with oversight, that tries to inject itself into every interaction, that makes itself a necessary evil just to get something done... that's the kind of Government that destroys our American notion of freedom.</p>
<p>	Using an established "election vehicle", like the Republican Party, to fix the problem is very questionable, however.  It's pragmatism at its worst, because it addresses the problem sideways rather than head-on.</p>
<p>	The real problem isn't what the major parties are DOING.  The real problem is that the major parties ARE the political process.  That leaves no room for individual voices.</p>
<p>	How can we "own our vote", when the Parties are there at every step of our thinking and acting?  They've made themselves a "necessary evil".  They've passed laws at all levels that have institutionalized their importance.  </p>
<p>	Rather than trying to convince Party oligarchs to align with your views, why not replace them?</p>
<p>	And by that, I do not mean finding another proxy for your views.</p>
<p>	I mean being involved, directly.</p>
<p>	We need people who are... well, their own people.  Leaders who have no loyalty other than to their sense of public duty.  People who can be trusted to stick to their principles, but also to actively seek common ground with others.</p>
<p>	It can be done.</p>
<p>	The mood is right; the largest group, according to a Gallup Poll, is Independents (43%).  This is a first in our history since the early 1900s.</p>
<p>	We cannot waste this opportunity to change our history for the better.  We cannot wait for a "savior" candidate to steal the reins of Party power in Washington, or anywhere else for that matter.  We must chart our own course.  We must BE that person.</p>
<p>	That's why I'm asking you to consider standing as a candidate for the state legislature in your district, either as an independent or with the Volunteer Party.  The Volunteer Party is a third party (with an expiration date) that is currently circulating petitions for ballot access in November.</p>
<p>	You can read about our core principles below.  Our one driving desire, despite our differences, is to have a society that allows people to be themselves and follow their conscience without persecution, so long as they do not harm others.  You can find out more about us on our website at:</p>
<p>http://www.missourivolunteermovement.com/</p>
<p>	We aren't looking for candidates who are 100% on board with every principle set forth in our platform, but it would be nice if they agree with at least two of the following four principles:</p>
<p>(1) Strengthen local, community, and individual voices in politics.  Change the system from a "top-down" approach to a "bottom-up" approach.</p>
<p>(2) Reform the election process to give people more choices and the ability to give real feedback.  The two-party system has been no good for democracy.</p>
<p>(3) Simplify laws and government.  Require documents to be publicly available, so that people can understand what's happening and take part.</p>
<p>(4) Give people choices in the way that they pay taxes.  Allow them to support the programs they choose with their taxes, so that they aren&rsquo;t forced to pay for something that violates their conscience.  </p>
<p>Our reasons for a local and state-based approach are explained here:</p>
<p>http://www.missourivolunteermovement.com/VM_Article_Our_Upside_Down_Democracy</p>
<p>	As you might have noticed, our approach to reform is largely structural rather than policy-based.  As a party, we avoid taking stances on &ldquo;issues&rdquo; like gay marriage, animal rights, gun control, minimum wage, etc.  However, as individuals we, of course, have very definite views on the subject.  The point of our party is to support a system that allows officer-holders to speak their individual minds, to be accountable to their electorate, and allows voters a real choice.  This means scrubbing out corporate and special interests, dismantling the two-party system, reforming our voting and tax laws, and ensuring that government activity occurs in the public eye and not behind closed doors.</p>
<p>	Being a candidate requires you to serve if you are elected, of course. Also, we need a commitment of at least 2 hours a week during the campaign season, which will run from the beginning of May through the end of October.<br />
	That's 8 hours a month, during a six-month period, for a total commitment of around 50 hours. That may seem like a lot, but it's about one-sixth of the time that the average person spends on social networking sites. </p>
<p>	Legislators serve a two-year term in the House, and four years in the Senate.  The legislative session only lasts 5 months out of the year, from January to May.  Legislators are paid around $40,000 per year for their service (this includes the daily stipend).</p>
<p>You can read more on the benefits and requirements for state office here:</p>
<p>http://www.missourivolunteermovement.com/Elections.html#candidate</p>
<p>	We need thoughtful, honest, not-crazy, not-greedy, not-party people in our legislature, regardless of their ideology. We're running as a "political party" in name only.  We don't intend to let it become an election-winning machine because there will be an expiration date on the party, and ordinary people like us get to write the bylaws as we see fit. </p>
<p>	It would be very helpful if you could give us an answer within two weeks.  If you want to ask us questions, we would be happy to answer any emails or phone calls, or arrange to meet with you in person.</p>
<p>	If you are not interested in running with our party, but are interested in running as an independent, let us know and we will help you circulate the petitions and gather signatures.  The more independents we have in the legislature, the better off everyone will be.</p>
<p>	I beg you to take the idea of public service seriously, even if you think that you aren't "qualified".  Being honest, thoughtful and free of special interests puts you far ahead of many who currently hold positions in our legislature.  Democracy only works if "ordinary" people are willing to do extraordinary things.</p>

<p>P.S. If being a candidate doesn&rsquo;t interest you, but you know others who would be interested, send us their names and information and we will contact them.  Also if you still want to be involved, just not as a candidate, do not hesitate to contact us.  There are forums on our website that show our current platform and charter.  We would love your input and feedback!</p>
<p>P.P.S. You might be wondering why I'm not working in the Libertarian Party, since I share many of the same views.  The Libertarians suffer from a national obsession, a top-down approach to reform.  The MO Libertarians are subject to national party decrees.  Third, the Libertarians are a mess, organizationally, and have a reputation for failure.  More importantly, Missouri law allows benefits to a new party that "established parties" (like the Libertarians) do not get.  It's part of a "blitz" strategy to run for every office in the legislature.  There are other reasons, if you'd like to discuss them in more detail.  It suffices to say that we'll be working with the Libertarians, independents, and other third-party movemements to coordinate our efforts for 2016.  We could use your help!<br />
