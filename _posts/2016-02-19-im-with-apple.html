<p>The government wants Apple to build a back door into the iPhone. Apple has refused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Apple on this one.</p>
<p><span></span>This back door would allow the FBI to access the content of the San Bernardino terrorists&rsquo; phone, possibly exposing more terrorists. That would be a good thing.</p>
<p>But Apple never built a back door to the iPhone because <strong>no one can control the keys to such portals</strong><span></span>. If Apple builds it, every government spy agency in the world will be able to read your texts, see where you&rsquo;ve been, and listen to your phone calls. Every government and many hackers will access each of your bank accounts, credit card numbers, everything.</p>
<p>The government says you can trust it with your most sensitive information. But <strong>who trusts the government?</strong><span></span> Hillary Clinton transferred top secret information to a server in her bedroom. And she could be our next president. The United States government lost everything Edward Snowden released. The government is subject to hackers and crackers, too.</p>
<p><strong>The only safe back door is no back door</strong>. While I want to find and kill all the terrorists as much as the next guy, I also want a phone and a laptop that the government&mdash;ours, North Korea&rsquo;s, and Russia&rsquo;s&mdash;cannot hack into.</p>
<p>And<strong> I do not trust the government.</strong></p>
