<p>You might have heard that State Senator Dave Schatz gutted ethics reform in Missouri. According to Ryan Johnson of <a href="http://www.missourifreedom.com">Missouri Alliance for Freedom</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cleaning up the practice of Jefferson City&rsquo;s revolving door is the reason for Rep. Caleb Rowden&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&amp;id=1a969cb5f4&amp;e=23eaa27bc8">House Bill 1979</a>&nbsp;(carried in the Senate by Sen. Bob Onder). It puts in place a one year cooling off period that will make legislators sit out for at least a year before lobbying. It passed the House early and with overwhelming support.</p>
<p>It was the Senate that gutted his bill.<strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&amp;id=6e9735724c&amp;e=23eaa27bc8">Senator Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan</a>, offered an&nbsp;<a href="http://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&amp;id=0350b5acc4&amp;e=23eaa27bc8">amendment</a>&nbsp;to strip out the one year cooling off period making the bill worthless</strong>. His amendment passed and for now the&nbsp;<a href="http://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&amp;id=8070c6a02c&amp;e=23eaa27bc8" target="_blank">revolving door</a>&nbsp;remains open.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury the Senate played cute by allowing his amendment to have a vote by the practice of standing division. This means <strong>there is no written record of who voted to gut the revolving door bill except ours</strong>. It helps that we are in the Capitol watching.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's what I wrote to my State Senator Dave Schatz:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator,</p>
<p>Why did you gut the the ethics reform bill?</p>
<p>I understand you pushed the amendment to remove the one-year cooling off period from HB 1979, making the law meaningless. Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Missouri is the wild west of revolving-door politics, as you know. By gutting a common sense ethics reform bill, you seem to say, "I like cronyism more than I like good government."</p>
<p>As a voter and activist in your district, I find your position disturbing, and I look forward to your next appearance on the ballot. Then again, you probably do, too. <strong>With Missouri's revolving door, win one time and you're set for life.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Bill Hennessy</p></blockquote>
<p>Other Republicans who supported Schatz's amendment and opposed clean government include:</p>
<p>&bull; Senator Ed Emery<br />
&bull; Senator Mike Kehoe<br />
&bull; Senator Doug Libla<br />
&bull; Senator Wayne Wallingford<br />
&bull; Senator Paul Wieland</p>
<p>Let's give these Senators a swift kick through that revolving door. Maybe they'll do less damage as lobbyists than as legislators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
