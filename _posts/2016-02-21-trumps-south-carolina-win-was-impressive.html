  content: But one must wonder if only Cruz or Rubio were running, would one's votes
    go to the other? I believe so and that would have defeated Trump. It's time for
    Cruz and Rubio to put their egos aside and for the bottom tier to drop out.

<p>I got tire of scrolling.</p>
<p>Politico shows the results of <a href="http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/south-carolina">each county in South Carolina</a>, my state of residence&nbsp;from 1985 to 1992.</p>
<p>Abbeville: Trump</p>
<p>Aiken: Trump</p>
<p>Allendale: Trump</p>
<p>Anderson: Trump</p>
<p>Bamberg: Trump</p>
<p>Barnwell: Trump</p>
<p>Beaufort: Trump</p>
<p>Berkeley: Trump</p>
<p>It goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>Donald Trump not only won the geography, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/south-carolina-exit-poll/">he won the demography</a>:</p>
<p>Evangelical Christians: Trump</p>
<p>Born-again Christians: Trump</p>
<p>Conservative Voters: Trump</p>
<p>Moderate Voters: Trump</p>
<p>Young Voters: Trump</p>
<p>Old Voters: Trump</p>
<p>First-time Voters: Trump</p>
<p>Veterans/Military: Trump</p>
<p>Women: Trump</p>
<p>Men: Trump</p>
<p>High School Grads: Trump</p>
<p>College Grads: Trump</p>
<p>It goes on and on and on like Journey song.</p>
<p>Granted, there are demographic/psychographic groups Trump did not win, but very view. Rubio did better among post-grad folks. Cruz did better among people very conservative voters. But the breadth of Trump's win is staggering. And he did the same thing in New Hampshire. He won all the major demographics and almost all the counties.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has now won New Hampshire and South Carolina by double digits. His chances of winning the nomination are above 80 percent, probably closer to 90 percent.</p>
<p><strong>It's time for Republicans and Republican-leaners to start dealing with the probability that Donald J. Trump will be the party's standard-bearer in 2016.</strong></p>
<p>Since 1996, ordinary Americans have warned the political and corporate elites not to ignore their&nbsp;plight. But the elites didn't listen.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/02/20/this-is-the-gen-x-election/">They're listening now</a>.</p>
