    Thanks, Cindy. You are not alone.

    If it helps, you said something important: "we all need to start fixing ourselves." That's true no matter who's president. And you might like this article by John O'Sullivan of National Review. http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431951/donald-trump-gop-future. You might find Mr. O'Sullivan and me too Pollyanna, but despair won't fix anything. And just because it's unlikely that Senator Cruz will win the White House doesn't mean he won't be around to help restore America's goodness. (Although he has some self-fixing to do in that regard, as well.) He will still be in the Senate, and possibly with a president who will sign the bills Congress sends him.

  content: "You asked if accomplishing there's goals would make me happy, here are
    my point-by-point thoughts:\n\nHe&rsquo;ll build a wall and enforce immigration
    laws\n-Nope. I don't like the idea of a wall. Not only keeps people out, but out
    keeps people in.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll suspend Islamic immigration until we &ldquo;figure
    out what&rsquo;s going on&rdquo;\n- No. Too nebulous. Too close for comfort. What's
    to stop him from saying the same thing about Catholic/Christian immigrants from
    the Middle East or any other group he feels threatened by?\n\nHe&rsquo;ll rebuild
    the military\n - Okay... Cool. Rebuild to what? The 1980s? The cold war is over.
    It's a different world we live in. \"Rebuilding\" the military isn't a simple
    proposition in 2016. Let's tear it apart and start all over with a more nimble,
    agile, advanced fighting force.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll fix the VA\n- Sounds great. Good
    luck with that.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll protect gun rights - Great! I don't believe him,
    but good on him if he does.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll tear up the Iran nuclear deal and craft
    a new one that works - Great.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll demand fair trade practices from
    China, Mexico, Japan, and other partners - Again, sounds great, but I don't ever
    believe it will happen with Trump because I'm not convinced he's not a globalist.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll
    cut individual taxes on most Americans and simplify the tax code \n- This would
    make me happy.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll cut corporate rates and repatriate trillions of
    dollars currently off-shore\n- As would this.\n\nHe&rsquo;ll repeal Obamacare
    and replace it with something better\n- More universal health care? I'm not sure
    I like the idea.\n\nI know you specifically said you weren't asking if Trump could
    actually accomplish these but just if they would make us happy on face value.
    I counter that such a question misses the point. Because as you say, happiness
    is synthesized. So our potential happiness in seeing these goals accomplished
    would ultimately even out. Does it really matter then what our happiness is? So
    the question then becomes: can he actually do it? In many cases I don't think
    he can, and in some cases if he does, I don't trust him to do it right. Why? Because
    he's a narcissistic megalomaniac. He's not looking out for the \"plebs.\" He's
    looking out for him. He'll sell us down river as soon as it suits him. Then how
    happy will we be? "

    a deal with him...no matter what it is. If he doesn't offer to finish building
    Rubio's track, he is Trump Towers above the rest of the field in my opinion. \nEndnote:

  content: Marco Rubio, the lying, baby face SELLOUT who was/is the face of Amnesty
    wants the people to vote for him because he is the only one who can win the election.
    Really? Rubio came in 3rd in Iowa, 5th in New Hampshire and basically tied for
    second in South Carolina. It is clear, the Establishment has now sided with Rubio
    as their boy and that Rubio is the only one who can win over Killary. Remember
    the Establishment has not been to successful in picking winners in presidential
    races. It was Bob Dull who was their pick. Then John McLame and Mitt Romney were
    the unbeatable and we all know how that turned out. This country does not need
    another Establishment pick. Rubio was coerced and manipulated by DemonRAT Chuck
    Schumer and was the Gang of Eight&rsquo;s FACE of Amnesty. He was manipulated
    by the DemonRATS in the past, which means he could be manipulated in the future.
    Rubio&rsquo;s current position on immigration is a delayed Amnesty. Anyone who
    supports Amnesty should be disqualified from running for President, because they
    are admitting they would not abide by their oath of office.

    citizens when he was born in America. Do you believe the founders meant to give
    citizenship/naturalization authority to illegal immigrants? They have been misinterpreting
    the Constitution on Anchor babies and Congress by statute or amendment should
    clarify the position. It is because of the misinterpretation that Rubio would
    be eligible to run for president. However, Rubio was the FACE of Amnesty which
    should disqualify him from running.

  content: 'Trey Gowdy said, &ldquo;Marco is a rock solid conservative and a strong
    leader we can trust. &rdquo;Trey, do you even know what Conservative means? Ted
    Cruz is a TRUE Conservative and the best candidate running for office.  Rubio,
    on the other hand,  is a baby face lying SELLOUT and was/is the face of Amnesty.
    Here are reasons why not to support Marco Rubio for the Republican candidate for
    president: On 9/17/15 Marco Rubio was on the Sean Hannity radio show and still
    supports amnesty for the illegal immigrants in this country. The black lives matter
    or should they be called black lies, are agitators, being supported by George
    Soros and his ilk, and now Marco Rubio. Rubio also supports letting in the Syrian
    migrants/refugees stating that is who we are as a country. He did say they need
    to be vetted and said it would be difficult to do, because you could not contact
    the Syrian government to find out about them. What? The Arab Nations should handle
    the problem. The U.S. should not be taking in any refugees from Syria, because
    it is more likely than not some of them would be terrorists. It would be an invasion.
    Now, Rubio has a billionaire supporter who supports Amnesty and will become his
    puppet.  Anyone who supports Amnesty or letting the Muslim "migrants" come into
    this country should be eliminated from the presidential race.  The people need
    to WAKE up! BTW Trey, what if anything are you going to do about the many Federal
    law violations Killary Clinton has committed? Why are you not demanding AG Loretta
    Lynch do her job and prosecute her?'

  content: Many people, political consultants, the media do not understand the phenomenon
    that is Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a great marketer of himself and his brand.
    People know him from his successful television show the &ldquo;Celebrity Apprentice.&rdquo;   Many
    people are influenced by pictures and videos. So they think they know Trump. Then
    there were the pictures and videos of the invasion of illegal immigrants coming
    into the country from the southern border of the United States. They see the pictures
    and videos of the havoc and chaos occurring with the Muslim invasion of Europe.
    Trump is saying what the people want and that is he is going to stop it. Trump
    has called for a stop to the invasion of this country, which needs to happen.
    I do like the fact that Trump has been stirring it up and taking it to Hussein
    Obama putting him on the defensive, along with some RINO&rsquo;s, but I am supporting
    Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz is the best candidate running for president.

    Thanks for the straight-forward pep talk.  We all need a reality check now and then.  BTW ... concerning "The only undoable things that have happened were Supreme Court rulings. And only a constitutional amendment can undo those."  And that can be undone through a Convention of States that is &ldquo;limited to proposing amendments to the United States Constitution that impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office for its officials and members of Congress.&rdquo;  www.conventionofstates.com

    Bill, you list Trump's goals as if they will be genuinely pursued. It is risky to believe someone whose new found Conservatism was discovered precisely when it became politically convenient. He has waxed in-eloquently about single payer health care . His campaign hopes with the Tea Party should be dead on arrival with that point alone. He was braggadocios about participating with the K-Street/Wall St. cabal to manipulate the political system for his benefit. That too should make his campaign dead on arrival. The two founding issues for the Tea Party were government run health care and the Wall St. bailout. (I heard you explain it)
    Beck is hyperbolic about Trump, and in general, to be sure. Glen Beck would claim that poisoned purple coolaide would spark the zombie apocalypse when there is no need to exaggerate the effects of poison coolaide.  The dangers of Trump do not need to be exaggerated.
    Finally, it was Obama nominees who decided in favor of the "undoable things" you mentioned. I know you realize the next POTUS will determine the future SCOTUS. A nominee that will uphold the Kelo decision, and Trump and his ilk stealing land, is not the same nominee who would likely uphold the 2nd amendment with Heller decision or the Constitution in general.

    Tom,

    Thank you for the thoughtful response. Lots of great points. One thing you mentioned, though, that Obama's appointees delivered undoable rulings. Reagan appointed Anthony Kennedy and George W. Bush appointed John Roberts. They were the key votes, not Kegan, not Sotomayor.

    Honestly Bill?  You don't see the nearly identical situation we were looking at in early '08? ...except now it's "our" side that is pushing a NARCISSIST promising hope-and-change - oops, I mean to make-our-country-great.  How many then unquestioningly took the word of another candidate who promised solutions to all of their ills?  It doesn't make it right just because this one has an "R" after his name (for the moment).
    I agree with Gabe, it's a good list, and getting those things accomplished would make us happy.  I'm just not convinced, no I'm sure, there are some he just CAN'T DO in a bombastic, Trumpian way, and the way he'll accomplish others won't make conservatives happy...    I don't know why I should trust him more or differently than Obama - their past actions belie their current words.
    As for your real or synthesized happiness - there is more to a satisfied soul than simply the "feeling" of happiness.  Yes, it's possible to resign ourselves and find happiness in a situation we cannot change, but there are a lot of us out here not ready to "synthesize" it.  We want a change of American hearts and a higher standard to aspire to than a Trump America, and we believe it IS possible.
    You have really disappointed me.

    If I can't have Cruz, I'll settle for Trump, and with a lot more enthusiasm than I had for McCain or Romney.

    Rubio=Bush. If the Bush/Ryan/McConnell GOPe global view is now the definition of "conservatism", count me out.

    All of these people mad at Trump should be directing their anger at elected "do nothing" republicans that hide and try to gorge themselves at the DC trough.

    Now, if we could only get this level of Trumpers to come out to the polls in mid term elections for another tea party wave of primaries.... Any elected Republican with more than 6 years in DC should be thrown out in a primary election.

    will compromise their principles because of anger.  I'm angry too, but looking
    to Trump as the answer to \"fix\" things is only transferring our trust from a
    failed Washington, to someone who may be able to change some \"things\" but won't
    heal our soul.\nI'm frustrated because conservatives with a voice have fallen
    in line behind Trump, because he can win.  I don't trust Trump, like I didn't
    trust Obama, but people are again looking for a \"leader\" to fix us instead of

    So, what's the worst that could happen? I'd put nuclear war pretty high on that list. Trump's arrogance, interacting with Putin's arrogance, or with Kim Jon Un's mental instability, could be all it takes. Sure, Reagan was tough, but Trump's no Reagan.

    I also think Trump would screw up the Supreme Court just as badly as Hillary Clinton. When Trump was musing about Cruz's ineligibility to run, he cited Lawrence Tribe as the legal mind he trusted. Tribe is the left wing dream of a Supreme Court justice. His only saving grace is that he's 74.

<p>Watch this great TED talk by Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert. It's one of the top 20 TED talks of all time for a reason. Dan is a brilliant guy who studies happiness.</p>

<p>In case you weren't paying attention, here are three big takeaways that will help you tomorrow and for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>One year after winning the lottery or losing the use of your legs, you'll be just as happy as you were before the event.</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="t-156000" class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="156000">These are the data.</span>&nbsp;<span id="t-157214" class="talk-transcript__fragment talk-transcript__fragment--current" data-time="157214">You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture.</span>&nbsp;<span id="t-161000" class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="161000">Because the fact is that <strong>a year after losing the use of their legs,</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;<span id="t-165000" class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="165000">and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics</span>&nbsp;<span id="t-170000" class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="170000">are equally happy with their lives.</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>We are terrible at predicting how a future event will affect our happiness.</p>

<p>Happiness can be synthesized, and synthesized happiness is often better than organic.</p>

<p>Let's go back to November 2012. Remember how you felt after the networks called the election for Obama? And now think back to December 2012. Did you celebrate Christmas? New Year's?</p>
<p>I'm guessing that between December 2012 and December 2015, you were just about as happy as you were between December 2005 and December 2008.</p>
<p>Don't make your happiness contingent on an election. It's not worth it. Glenn Beck will not&nbsp;give away his millions and live in a cave if Trump wins. He'll go on saying crazy, insane things that ruin people's days because that's what Glenn Beck does. People pay him to ruin their days. (Stupid me--ruining people's days for free.)</p>
<p>Yes, many people expected the next president would be a constitutional conservative. (I hate that phrase and&nbsp;love the concept.) But what's the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>You think Trump will dissolve Congress and become a dictator? We thought Obama would do that. And, while Obama has overreached his authority as President, <strong>so far he's done nothing that can't be undone</strong>. The only undoable things that have happened were Supreme Court rulings. And only a constitutional amendment&nbsp;can undo those. A change in president won't make much of a difference.</p>
<p>You think Ted Cruz would not&nbsp;enforce the Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling? How would that&nbsp;be different from Obama refusing to enforce immigration laws? Cruz might not prosecute bakers who won't bake cakes, but he'll recognize same-sex marriages in the law. If he doesn't, he doesn't really believe in the rule of law, does he?</p>
<p>So what's the worst that could happen with a President Trump? Let's assume that he's serious about the few things he's talked about most frequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>He'll build a wall and enforce immigration laws</li>
<li>He'll suspend Islamic immigration until we "figure out what's going on"</li>
<li>He'll rebuild the military</li>
<li>He'll fix the VA</li>
<li>He'll protect gun rights</li>
<li>He'll tear up the Iran nuclear deal and craft a new one that works</li>
<li>He'll demand fair trade practices from China, Mexico, Japan, and other partners</li>
<li>He'll cut individual taxes on most Americans and simplify the tax code</li>
<li>He'll cut corporate rates and repatriate trillions of dollars currently off-shore</li>
<li>He'll repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better</li>
</ul>
<p>Please tell me&nbsp;if accomplishing those goals would make you happy. Notice I didn't ask if the list is complete, and I didn't ask if you think Trump can do it. (He can, but that's a different matter.) I'm asking you to tell me in the comments if you'd be happy if Trump accomplished all of those things. I know you'll answer truthfully.</p>
<p>Maybe he won't champion pro-life legislation, but it sounds to me like he'll enforce the law on life. And I suspect he'll sign pro-life legislation if any comes from Congress. A lot like Reagan. He said repeatedly he would defund Planned Parenthood unless they stop performing abortions. There's no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;disbelieve him.</p>
<p>He's also talked about eliminating waste in government. Is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>Sure, I like Cruz's and Carson's tax plans better, but I'll take Trump's gladly. It's a big improvement and actually would make it easier to get to Cruz's later.&nbsp;And Trump told Adam Carolla&nbsp;he likes Cruz's plan a lot better than the status quo. So if Cruz can get Congress to pass his tax plan, Trump will sign it.</p>
<p>Now think about this: would it be any easier for Cruz to get the flat tax through Congress as President? Kemp-Roth had a team of dedicated members of Congress working for years to get that overhaul through. Years. If Cruz's plan does not have a coalition to push it now, it won't when he's President.</p>
<p>So the chances of enacting Cruz's tax plan are actually better with Trump in the White House and Cruz working full time in the Senate. No one in Congress can champion Cruz's plan like Senator Cruz can, right?</p>
<p>If you look at Trump's life, it's easy to see him accomplishing most of the goals on his list. I think he can. He really does have a history of getting stuff done when no one else could figure out how.</p>
<p>Further, I think Trump is probably the most likely of the remaining Republican candidates to win in November. I know what the conventional wisdom says, but the conventional wisdom has been completely wrong about Trump since day one.</p>
<p>The fact is, <strong><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruzs-general-election-strategy-is-wishful-thinking/">Cruz's November strategy was tragically flawed</a>.</strong> He banked on a groundswell of evangelicals who didn't vote in 2012. But he was wrong.&nbsp;Evangelicals voted in large number in 2012--more than in 2008. The voters who didn't vote in 2012 were working Americans--<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald-trump-republicans-diversity-219752">the very people Trump has fired up</a>. Many of them are also evangelical, but they're not Cruz evangelicals--they're Reagan Democrats and Ross Perot voters. Those record turnouts in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada were largely owing to Trump, not Cruz.&nbsp;(<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/12/22/party-like-its-1992/">I wrote extensively on the subject here</a>.)</p>
<p>And Rubio's strategy is Romney's strategy warmed-over. With less money. And a less accomplished politician.</p>
<p><strong>If Trump continues to defy conventional expectations through November, he will win in a landslide</strong>.</p>
<p>And, again, I ask: with a Republican Congress, how terrible would a President Trump be?</p>
<p>Having read The Art of the Deal, I am confident that Trump is not a globalist and he loves America. He really, really loves America. While I disagree with a number of his positions, some strongly, I truly believe he'd make a much better president than Hillary or Obama. He might cause some face-palm moments for us, but not because of groveling to a tinhorn dictator.</p>
<p>I'm not telling anyone to abandon your favorite candidate right now. I'm saying think critically about what a President Trump would really be like. I can promise you that it won't be as bad as you think it will be when you're thinking about it--and it might be a whole lot better.</p>
