<p>That was a strategic kill-shot, to borrow <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/140028326981/the-choke-artist-versus-the-watch-salesman-trump">Scott Adams's word</a>. And it changes everything for conservatives.</p>
<p>After a so-so debate performance and in the middle of a 16-hour verbal assault from Marco Rubio, Trump went nuclear. But not the way everyone would expect Trump to go nuclear.</p>
<p><strong>Trump didn't need to invent a brilliant new put-down line to counter Marco</strong>. Instead, he calmly introduced Chris Christie to 10,000 fans in Texas. Christie did the rest.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am proud to be here to endorse Donald Trump to be president of the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Now&nbsp;<em>that</em> is a kill-shot.</strong></p>
<p>Former RNC chairman <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/26/exclusive-former-rnc-chairman-michael-steele-boom-trumps-christie-endorsement-was-a-drop-the-mic-moment/">Michael Steele told Breitbart News</a>, "One word: BOOM! Exclamation point," about the endorsement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today after what we saw&nbsp;<span class="scoreregex" data-govtrackid="412491" data-title="Sen" data-first="Marco" data-last="Rubio" data-party="R" data-state="FL" data-grade="C" data-average="79" data-link="marco-rubio/?utm_campaign=breitbartapi&amp;utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=breitbart" data-image="412491.jpeg">Marco Rubio</span>do last night, he was out there attacking Trump on twitter and Trump was like, got one for you, BOOM!&nbsp;Now the guy who defined Marco a few weeks ago is back in the game. He&rsquo;s engaged, and he&rsquo;s working with Trump. BOOM!</p></blockquote>
<p>And New Gingrich tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This Chris Christie endorsement of Trump is real signal to GOP establishment that they had better begin thinking about Trump as the future</p>
<p>&mdash; Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) <a href="https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/703283538288836608">February 26, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p>
Chris Christie endorsement of Trump is a major breakthrough.this is a huge step for Trump and will impact super tuesday bug time.</p>
<p>&mdash; Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) <a href="https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/703283159488712704">February 26, 2016</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Just&nbsp;a little while later, Maine's governor endorsed Trump. And <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/02/26/kasich-nobody-s-gonna-win-but-trump.html">John Kasich predicted a Trump sweep</a> on Super Tuesday, saying "nobody's gonna win but Trump," before admitting he doesn't know about Texas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Peggy Noonan offers the best explanation of Trump's rise I've read so far in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Trump+and+the+Rise+of+the+Unprotected&amp;rlz=1C1TSNP_enUS507US507&amp;oq=Trump+and+the+Rise+of+the+Unprotected&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.710j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8">Trump and the Rise of the Unprotected</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There are the protected and the unprotected. The protected make public policy. The unprotected live in it. The unprotected are starting to push back, powerfully.</p>
<p><strong>The protected are the accomplished, the secure, the successful</strong>&mdash;those who have power or access to it. They are protected from much of the roughness of the world. More to the point, <strong>they are protected&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>from the world they have created.</strong>&nbsp;</em>Again, they make public policy and have for some time.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The "unprotected." Perfect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/02/25/donald-trump-supporters-brexit-preference-falsfication-2016-primaries-column/80856410/">Glenn Reynolds offers a similar case</a> for people's attraction to Trump, and forecasts an avalanche of support about to rain down:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>
In his terrific book,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674707583/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0674707583&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=insta0c-20&amp;linkId=FF6JTGUSOCVQLI5Y">Private Truths, Public Lies</a>:</em><em>The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification,</em>&nbsp;Timur Kuran&nbsp;writes about the phenomenon he calls &ldquo;preference falsification&rdquo;: <strong>People tend to hide unpopular views to avoid ostracism or punishment; they stop hiding them when they feel safe.</strong></p>
<p>This can produce rapid change: In totalitarian societies like the old&nbsp;Soviet Union, the police and propaganda organizations do their best to enforce preference falsification. Such regimes have little legitimacy, but they spend a lot of effort making sure that citizens don't realize the extent to which their fellow-citizens dislike the regime. If the secret police and the censors are doing their job, 99% of the populace can hate the regime and be ready to revolt against it &mdash; but <strong>no revolt will occur because no one realizes that everyone else feels the same way</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This works until something breaks the spell&nbsp;and the discontented realize that their feelings are widely shared, at which point the collapse of the regime may seem very sudden to outside observers &mdash; or even to the citizens themselves</strong>. Kuran calls this sudden change a &ldquo;preference cascade,&rdquo; and I wonder if that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening here.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah Palin made it okay for Tea Partiers to support Trump. With Christie's endorsement, it's now okay for mainstream Republicans to admit they hate the elites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glenn Reynolds wrote his column before Christi's endorsement making it&nbsp;somewhat prescient. I think Glenn is right, as usual. Trump is a natural leader in <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/02/22/donald-trump-reads-my-blog/">the new political dichotomy </a>and the perfect embodiment of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/02/20/this-is-the-gen-x-election/">the Generation X election</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For conservatives, it's time to stop the fatalism and start planning how to get the best possible policies from the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>
