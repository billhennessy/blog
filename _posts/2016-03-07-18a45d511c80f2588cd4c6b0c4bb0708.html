<p>William,<br />
I live in Ann  Wagner's district which is in St. Louis, MO.  She was one of the many republicans in the House that voted for the Omnibus bill that continued to find Obama's Liberal agenda. She has proven to be a typical "bought and paid for" politician who is more interested in aligning herself with the Washington elites than supporting her constituents - her voting record is proof of this.  She comes up for re-election in Jan. of 2017.<br />
How can we conservatives get the word out about her?  I have written her numerous times complaining about her record and only get a cookie cutter response.<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
