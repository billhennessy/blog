<p>Hi, I just thought I'd take you up on your bonus mental game because I like to think. So I don't know if you meant it seriously or not, or you were just trying to add flair to the article but here goes:-<br />
Rewrite of: Maybe he's not a conservative<br />
As far as I can tell, the hate for Eric Greitens given by the few conservatives who assume that he might not be conservative, is probably misplaced. In actuality it may be that he is more conservative than they think.<br />
With anything that culminates in a classification, the classification itself needs to be defined, before any such classification can begin. Is Eric Greitens a conservative? What are the rules that deem someone conservative or not?<br />
Thankfully, Hennessy provided a googled definition which dances to the tune of 'a person who is averse to change and holds to traditional values and attitudes, typically in relation to politics.' (I know not so much a rewrite rather than a reply but I'm using creative license as my excuse. Anyways lets continue).<br />
Hennessey argues that Greitens fails on the test for averseness, however this cannot be determined in the way Hennessey presented the information. Agreed that in order for something to qualify it needs to meet both criteria, however the problem arises from the term averse.<br />
Averse means to hold a strong opposition to something, however it doesn't necessarily mean that such actions would not be taken. One can be averse to something but still partake in the activity. As such, even though and can be seen that Greitens is championing change, it cannot be determined whether he likes that change or not. In life we are subject to many things that we don't like, but we do it anyway because we think the end justifies the means. It could be the case for Greitens where by the changes proposed are not something he would  admonish naturally, but he feels that it must be done in order to ( my haymaker punch is coming here) maintain the traditional values that he is accordance with. If so, if the changes are in his eyes a necessary evil in order to maintain traditional values, then he does indeed qualify as a conservative. How?<br />
He is trying to instigate change in order to sweep away opposition to his interpretation of traditional values. What?<br />
Looking at the list of things provided by Hennessey, we can see that none of the items are radical. They all fit into what most would consider traditional. Support veterans - not a radical idea, rather, a traditional one.<br />
Protect life - Traditional idea based on Christian theology.<br />
Protect faith - Haven't we as a species always tried to protect our faith thereby qualifying this as traditional.<br />
Restore the American dream - the use of the word restore should point something fundamental out.<br />
Radical would be something like: women to get paid more than men.<br />
In closing I think that I have shown that Greitens, even if some would think him not, is in fact, when we boil down to the base elements, is indeed, a conservative.</p>
<p>The end<br />
