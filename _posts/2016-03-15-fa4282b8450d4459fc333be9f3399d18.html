<p>Hi,My name is Dana Roberson and I&rsquo;m a producer at  New York Public Radio for a program called The Takeaway with John Hockenberry.  The Takeaway is a national radio program from New York Public Radio and Public Radio International and the New York Times.  We have over two million listeners on over 250 stations across the U.S.<br />
John Lamping suggested I reach out to you.  I was hoping you might be available to do an interview with us tomorrow morning to discuss Super Tuesday election results, Sen. Ted Cruz and a look ahead for his campaign.<br />
This is an audio interview, it can be done at a studio with an ISDN or via Skype.  The conversation would take around 10 minutes.   We would do the interview anytime between 7am-8:15am/ET or live between 9-10am/ET.  This would be for our program tomorrow (Wednesday) morning.   Please let me know if there is interest and availability.<br />
 Thank you in advance and I look forward to hearing from you.<br />
Best,</p>
<p>Dana</p>
