<p>My name is Eddie Adelstein. I am a medical examiner in Booneville. We did the autopsy on his publicity aid. It was consistent with a self-inflected gun shot wound.<br />
I would appreciate it if you would  read my article published in a local newspaper entitled "The mysterious death of Thomas Schweich". While your investigation  somewhat   supports his death a suicide, my investigation strongly suggests that either he was killed or forced to take his life to protect his family. If anything your article suggests that  suicide was highly unlikely and that there should be   further investigation.   Perhaps the things that really stress your credulity are as follows:<br />
1.  At 8:41 am he called the newspaper to confirm his appointment with them   where he was prepared to reveal the dirty politics of the republican party, his death acurred within in 7  minutes of the call.<br />
1.  He was the first auditor in 120 years when no one   ran against him.  He had 50  lawsuits pending against him by special interest groups<br />
3.  He clearly was capable of handling stressful situations as documented by his many successes.<br />
4.  I believe this to be the crime of the century<br />
5.  If you would like to contact me my cell phone is 573 999 7177 or  is you can give me your e-mail address I would send you copies of the article published and one that has not been published.  eddie adelstein M.D, Columbia MO<br />
