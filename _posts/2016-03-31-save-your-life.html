  content: "\nRight thinking folks, buy this book! Not only is Bill an exceptional
    writer, he is a \"you first\" kind of guy...unless there's a competition involved.
    This upcoming election quite possibly could be a good reason (if you somehow need
    a reason) to toss back a bevy or six, so why not do it without doing great harm
    to your body. "

    the finishing touches on a book.  I will purchase.

<p>My latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fight-To-Evolve-Governments-Secret-ebook/dp/B01DORSX0O?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=fight%20to%20evovle&amp;qid=1459474011&amp;ref_=sr_1_sc_1&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1-spell">Fight to Evolve: The Governments Secret War on NTX, is available for pre-order now at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>GET IT!</p>
<p>Folks, this is the war we're fighting. It's the war that pits innovation against entrenched incumbents. It's the too small to survive against too big to fail. And it's the reason we call ourselves conservatives.</p>
<p>Alcohol is killing your body, even if you're a casual drinking. (I'm 10x casual. Maybe 30x.) But there's a way of making alcohol that eliminates 93 percent of the damage. In other words, you can drink 10 drinks that have the effect of one. Why wouldn't you?</p>
<p>You wouldn't because bureaucrats in the U.S. government prohibited us from telling you about it. But we're fed up. We are telling you now. Bellion Vodka will save your liver.</p>
<p>Buy my book. You'll understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. I love you.</p>
