<p>It's a beautiful day in spring. The sky is radiant and wonderful blue. Birds singing, trees starting to bloom, grass an impossible shade of vibrant green. A cool and welcoming&nbsp;breeze licks your bare skin, your cheeks, and playfully ruffles your hair like a lover.</p>
<p>Your work is done, now, so you sit in your favorite outdoor chair and take in the relaxing, comfortable view. Smell the freshness of spring wildflowers. Let the sun gently warm your body from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. That's right, you deserved this.</p>
<p>Now you reach for a perfect vodka and cranberry juice to relax a bit more and damage your liver.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>I said "damage your liver."</p>
<p>Yes, it's true. Every sip of alcohol produces a measurable spike in liver stress just minutes after. Take a look:</p>

<p>Now you have something to think about, don't you, as you try to relax on this beautiful day in spring. You try to enjoy that delicious Cape Cod, but a little voice now whispers in your ear: "liver damage, my friend. Liver damage."</p>
<p>But it doesn't have to be that way.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">[<a style="color: #800000;" href="https://giveaway.amazon.com/p/36b7a4a06bae6f5c">Win a Free Copy of Fight to Evolve. No Purchase Necessary</a>]</span></strong></p>
<p>And maybe it isn't that way for you. If you happened to make your drink with vodka made with NTX, that 300% increase in DNA and liver damage is 93% smaller. Ninety-three percent safer. Almost completely safe. Almost no damage at all.</p>
<p>That's right, you might be drinking a safer drink and not even know. [continues below podcast]</p>

<p>The reason you don't know? It's not your fault. You don't know what's in your drink because some bureaucratic nerds at the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in Washington decided you don't deserve to know. These government weasels have banned discussion of NTX's health benefits in the United States. The TTB, as it's known, has ruled that the First Amendment does not apply to health and wellness.</p>
<p>And this isn't the first time the federal government has tried to prevent consumers like you from learning heath information that could save your&nbsp;lives or protect your children from crippling diseases. In the 1990s, Bill Clinton's administration tried three times to deny women safe access to information about folic acid and spina bifida. As a result, over 25,000 new, preventable cases of spina bifida occurred while the federal government censored information from the public.</p>
<p>That's disgusting, and every employee of the TTB should ashamed. And shunned. Do you know anyone who works at this secretive agency? If so, ask them why they won't let you know what's in your drink.</p>
<p>You've been drinking wrong all along, but you now you have a healthier choice. Demand your right to know what's in your drink. It could save you life.</p>
<p>[Tweet "You've been drinking wrong all along"]</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I will take part in a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington where Bellion Spirits, Chigurupati Technologies, Campaign for Liberty, the Coalition for Safer Drinking, and legendary First Amendment lawyer Jonathan Emord will announce plans to force the TTB to honor the Constitution and let you&nbsp;know what's in your drink. What you do with that information is up to you, but you have every right under the Constitution to have the information now.</p>
<p>Ponder that as you enjoy this beautiful spring day.</p>
