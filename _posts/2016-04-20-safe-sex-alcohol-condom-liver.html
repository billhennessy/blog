<p>Let's regress in time to the 1980s.</p>
<p>Remember C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon-General who launched the Safe Sex movement? Koop wanted to curtail the spread of AIDS.&nbsp;The Safe Sex movement started slowly and originally focused on non-monogamous gay men. By 1987, though, everyone was doing it. (Or not doing "it" as the case may be.) A February 17, 1987 New York Times headline declared "Safe Sex Movement Gains Favor Among Heterosexuals." The story said, "Caution is in. The one-night stand is out." And a woman in a condom ad said, "I'd do a lot for love, but I won't die for it."</p>
<p><strong>Think of the&nbsp;<a href="http://saferalcohol.com/blog/" target="_blank">Coalition for Safer Drinking&nbsp;</a>as the Safe Sex movement for alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;Chigurupati Technologies'&nbsp;<strong>NTX is like a condom for your liver and DNA</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="http://billhennessy.com/simple-strategies?tag=NTX">NTX prevents 93 percent of the liver damage&nbsp;</a>caused by drinking and about half of the DNA damage. (Yes, even one drink damages your DNA.)</p>

<p>In other words,&nbsp;<strong>we're facing reality on reality's terms</strong>. We know people drink, and we're not encouraging them to do so. We also know&nbsp;<strong>people care more and more about their health</strong>. Part of concern for health involves the stuff we put into our bodies, including alcohol.</p>
<p>So the Coalition for Safer Drinking wants you to know that regular alcohol is bad for your liver and your DNA, but&nbsp;<strong>alcohol made with NTX is nearly harmless to the liver</strong>&nbsp;and significantly safer for DNA. Right now, only <a href="http://www.bellionvodka.com/welcome#bellionvodka">Bellion Vodka contains NTX.</a> Bellion will be available throughout the United States this summer, so look for it. If you live in Texas, New York, or Connecticut, you can get Bellion right now.</p>

<p>I am the national spokesman for the Coalition for Safer Drinking and author of the book on NTX,&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/1QnRvVW" target="_blank">Fight to Evolve, which is available for Kindle</a>&nbsp;now and will be available in hardbound very soon. Look for it on Amazon.com. Contact me at bill-at-billhennessy.com. I'd be happy to schedule an interview for your radio program, blog, or podcast.</p>
