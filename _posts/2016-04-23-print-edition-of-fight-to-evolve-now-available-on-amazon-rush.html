<p>Most of my readers asked for a print edition of my new book, <a href="http://amzn.to/1SX2uY4">Fight to Evolve: The Government's Secret War on NTX</a>.</p>
<p>Great news! Your book is waiting for you on Amazon. It's just $17.99, and you'll be happy to know that I don't get a penny from the sales. All proceeds go to the Coalition for Safer Drinking and its fight to reduce alcohol's negative effects on health.</p>
<p>If you, like me, prefer electronic books, you can get the <a href="http://amzn.to/1ptvxe2">Kindle version of Fight to Evolve </a>for just $3.99 today, too.</p>
<p>If you know someone who drinks and you worry about their health, be a friend and buy a copy of Fight to Evolve for them, too. Two hardbound copies are about the same price as on bottle of good vodka. And you might save a life.</p>
