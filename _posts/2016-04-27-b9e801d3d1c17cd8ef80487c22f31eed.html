<p>I am the Executive Director of Legal Immigrants For America (LIFA). We have several speaking engagements in IL in mid-June at various tea party groups &amp; we would also like to speak to any St. Louis or MO groups in mid-June if possible. Visit our website at www.GoLIFA.com. We support promoting legal immigration, enforcing existing immigration laws, strengthening our borders, building a wall, opposing amnesty, defunding sanctuary cities, stopping H-1B visa abuse, prohibiting immigration from Muslim nations, &amp; halting the Syrian refugee program. Please let me know of any St. Louis area TP groups which might like to schedule a LIFA speaking engagement in mid-June. Thanks!<br />
