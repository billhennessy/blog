<p>You've probably found yourself saying words like "<strong>rigged</strong>" and "<strong>collusion</strong>" recently. <strong>They've become <em>sexy</em> words</strong>, haven't they. That's because Donald Trump's made rigged and collusion household words. He's put them in your head.</p>
<p>You might even use them wrong. "There was a collusion on highway forty-four." Or "I rigged my shorts." (BTW, Hillary sounds weak and hoarse, doesn't she? Grating.)</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed <strong>yourself saying rigged and collusion</strong>, <strong>pay attention tomorrow</strong>. I'm guessing you'll say rigged and collusion--both words--before you fall asleep. (But don't worry, you'll sleep like a baby.)</p>
<p>Scott Adams, the genius who creates Dilbert, pointed out <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/143431313681/the-unfavorability-illusion">Trump's remarkable ability to get in people's heads </a>long ago. Scott Adams is right, of course, and you knew it all along. Great cartoonists see people more accurately than psychologists.</p>
<p>But people are using the words "<strong>rigged</strong>" and "<strong>collusion</strong>" for another reason, independent of Trump. <strong>America&nbsp;<em>is</em> rigged</strong>. And the federal <strong>government&nbsp;<em>does</em> collude</strong> with big corporations to protect entrenched incumbents against innovation and creativity. People in St. Louis know how effectively government and big <strong>taxicab companies colluded to rig the market</strong> against rideshare companies like Lyft and Uber. Uber finally decided to ignore the riggers and colluders and offer to drive drunks home safely.</p>
<p>So if you're an inventor who can't catch a break, <strong>it's probably not your fault</strong>. The system is rigged. It's always been rigged, but it's more <strong>rigged</strong> now than ever before, isn't it? <strong>Just look around.</strong></p>
<p>When government and huge corporate interests rig the system, little guys get screwed. <strong>Sometimes people die</strong>. And the government just laughs, doesn't it?</p>
<p>You know I'm working with the <strong>Coalition for Safer Drinking to break the collusion</strong> racket of big liquor and big government. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fight-Evolve-Governments-Secret-War-ebook/dp/B01DORSX0O/">I wrote a book about it: <strong>Fight to Evolve</strong></a>. I love innovation, but I hate collusion and rigged markets. NTX technology makes drinking alcohol safer than eating some fast foods. But the government banned people from telling you these facts, because bureaucrats want&nbsp;to protect huge liquor companies and their profits. Screw them.</p>
<p><strong>I'm not supporting the colluding riggers anymore</strong>. I'm speaking for myself and saying what I believe, as I have most of the time since I wrote Conservative Manifesto in 1993.</p>
<p>And <strong>I think you're ready to throw off the mask of some rigged collusion</strong>&nbsp;and speak for yourself, are&nbsp;you not? You want to&nbsp;begin by ignoring the federal government's order to remain ignorant of NTX by <a href="http://amzn.to/1rzx44h">reading my new book Fight to Evolve</a>. You can defy the colluders.</p>
