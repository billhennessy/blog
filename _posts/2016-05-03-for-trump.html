  content: "To all you #NeverTrump people, did you feel the same way for Mitt Romney?
    \ It&rsquo;s funny; I do not recall any #NeverRomney during the 2012 election
    even though Romney was Obama like. There were no calls from Establishment RINO&rsquo;s
    to vote for Hussein Obama or to have someone run as a Third Party. Trump says
    he will deport illegals and stop the Muslim invasion, which RINO's and DemonRATS
    support, which is National suicide.  Again I ask these never Trump people, will
    the country be better off with Donald Trump as president, making America Great
    again, or Killary Clinton, who will continue on the path of destruction for the
    country with the DemonRAT'S policies. I will go with Trump! You should too. \n\nRemember
    at the first debate when all the candidates took an oath to support the nominee
    and not go Third party?  Trump did not take the oath that night, but did so later
    on. Now what? That is one of the reasons people are upset. Their words mean nothing.
    These politicians take an oath to uphold the Constitution and then fail at that."

  content: I have problems with some of Trumps positions on things in the past, but
    he has now "evolved" and is saying the right things, most importantly addressing
    the problem with illegal immigrants and the coming Muslim invasion. Can we believe
    him? I don&rsquo;t know, but I am willing to give him a chance considering the
    alternative. As for 2012 where millions of Republicans stayed home was because
    of the Establishment, which includes Romney, shut Ron Paul out. The Paulbots stayed
    home. Again, these never Trump people, which includes you, should ask themselves
    will the country be better off with Donald Trump, making America Great again,
    as president or Killary Clinton, who will continue on the path of destruction
    for the country with the DemonRAT'S policies. I will go with Trump! You and your
    friends should too.

  content: ENOUGH already! The nonsense between the Donald Trump and Trump supporters
    and Ted Cruz and Cruz supporters needs to stop. The goal is to keep a DemonRAT
    from winning the presidency, whether it is Killary Clinton, Berne Sanders or any
    other DemonRAT. The DemonRATS are for open borders and not enforcing the laws
    against illegals. They also support the Muslim invasion. Who do you think these
    people will be voting for with all the handouts the DemonRATS like to give out?  Trump
    says he will deport illegals and stop the Muslim invasion, which RINO's and DemonRATS
    support, which is National suicide.  DemonRATS support the abortion mill Planned
    Parenthood and the butchering of babies for profit.  Then there are the Supreme
    Court vacancies the next president will have to fill. What kind of justices do
    you believe a Clinton or Sanders would nominate? The focus should be placed on
    making sure Killary or Berne does not become the next president. So stop with
    the silliness from both camps.  Again I ask these never Trump people, will the
    country be better off with Donald Trump as president, making America Great again,
    or Killary Clinton, who will continue on the path of destruction for the country
    with the DemonRAT'S policies. I will go with Trump! You should too.

  content: Excellent commentary, Greg. Thanks.

<p>I'm for Trump.</p>
<p>I like stating the positive.</p>
<p>So I'm for Trump.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/01/22/trumps-conservative-critics-dont-get-it/"> NR Against Trump writers</a> can own it if Hillary wins and appoints <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/02/13/suddenly-2012-becomes-more-relevant-than-2016/">a Supreme Court justice who's to the left of Bader-Ginsberg </a>as Scalia's replacement.&nbsp;They'll take that&nbsp;to their graves.</p>
<p>For me, I'm for Trump. I'll admit <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/08/24/trump-good-bad-and-ugly/">he wasn't my first choice</a>, but he was far from my last choice. My first choice, Ben Carson, endorsed The Donald.</p>
<p>Trump&nbsp;seems to love America and Americans. His kids love him. His ex-wife endorsed him. And he has a history of accomplishing things everybody else thought hopeless.</p>
<p>A lot of people think America is hopeless, but Trump thinks he can fix it. Why not give him this chance? No one else has a plausible plan to fix our&nbsp;country. Trump's plan might be a little vague, but it's still viable. Everybody else's was dead on arrival. And who doesn't want to make America great again? Reagan did.</p>
<p>So I'm for Trump. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/02/24/why-so-many-conservatives-are-wrong-about-trump/">How bad could it be</a>?</p>
<p>I'm working on a longer post. Look for it on Sunday. But this one pretty much sums up my feelings and thoughts tonight, the night Americans rejected the political elite and took a&nbsp;chance on someone different from&nbsp;anything we've seen before.</p>
<p>I'm for America.</p>
<p>I'm for Trump.</p>
