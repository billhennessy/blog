  content: "My goodness, you are being pretty hard on George Will.  \n\nIf the federal
    government could get stuffed back into the Constitution, we wouldn't all be suffering
    from this massively toxic overdose of presidential election news.  POTUS wouldn't
    matter so doggone much.  Governor would be a lot more important; as it is, Missouri's
    gubernatorial race is absolutely eclipsed, because the presidential race is sucking
    up all the oxygen. \n\nDoesn't it make you weary?  Don't you just long for it
    to be over?"

  content: Yeah. I've said for years people should be able to name their town council
    rep before their member of Congress for the simple reason that local government
    should have more effect on their lives than some distant government in Washington.
    But the opposite is true today. Few people know anything about their local government.
    Or state.

  content: I agree on almost all of the problems Trump folk are reacting to; I cannot
    see how the worst perpetrator of New York City corruption is an answer. We're
    being ignored by the current folks who are supposed to be representing us; you
    see hope in the guy who routinely bought their attention and favor to the harm
    of us voiceless ones? You would reject a very honorable (and very smart) man who
    is totally committed to restoring our Constitution and right relations between
    government and the people, and to the principles that built us into an indomitable
    force for good in the world,  and instead embrace the one who has no values and
    no clue? His only "answers" are to shout down, bully, and threaten, even to death
    threats against those who would "dare" to represent those of us who disagree -
    and lie outrageously. No, I can't buy into that "solution". You think you want
    to "burn down" the GOP; I don't blame you. I deeply fear the result is going to
    burn down ALL of America, and the Communists are drooling in the wings. Remember,
    he's been with them a lot longer than "he's been with us."

  content: I'm actually rooting for both Trump and Clinton to  be in or their way
    to prison before either can do any harm :-) . But what has that argument gotten
    us over the past 24 years but an ever-more-corrupt and spineless GOP? And I'm
    not at all sure there's a difference between them (Trump just hired a Soros compatriot)
    except that he'd be waving a GOP flag over the mess. Then what?

  content: Lynn, I agree with you.  I will no longer be faced with voting for the
    lessor of two evils - this mess of an election has made me really think about
    my values and stand for what I believe.  Out of the original (what 17?) candidates
    - my top picks dropped out, one by one, with the GOP obviously trying to decide
    for me - I'm done.  I stood toe to toe with members of my family asking them to
    explain various Trump "policy", while trying not to offend and start a feud!  So,
    Bill . . . when someone accuses ME of putting Clinton in office (because I refuse
    to vote Trump), I can say, "No - YOU did that when you voted in the primary.

    your real name on that. You avoid responsibility for your passivity. As RUSH (the
    band) said, \"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.\" \n\nSo
    you've chosen to have an affair with the woman who killed 4 heroic Americans in
    Benghazi and compromised US security. \n\nYou don't have any children serving
    the country in uniform, do you? Pathetic. Weak."

  content: I've commented on your articles many times and most of the time, you have
    replied in agreement or a pleasant thank you of sorts - but, never a slam for
    not using my real name. Apparently my real name is only important if we happen
    to disagree.  I'm not avoiding responsibility and I am not passive - as I WILL
    be voting in the election.  I will just refuse to be a part of making a choice
    between two evils.  There are many months between now and November - and I am
    waiting to see what happens (I believe that God IS in charge, so you just never
    know what this will look like by November.)  And for the last of your points to
    somehow discredit my comment - No, I don't have children serving in the military
    - Just a Marine husband that received that "all expense paid vacation" in Viet
    Nam.  He NOT only got a tee shirt for attending - he got a couple Purple Hearts
    and a better understanding of politicians.

  content: "I have no doubt your husband is a remarkable man. You probably understand
    that I don't want my boys to earn Purple Hearts. Unless they have to. \n\nI'll
    be crass here, but I think my wife would prefer I took a bullet than one of our
    kids. Just sayin'. I wasn't talking about spouses. You know very well, don't you,
    that kids are different from spouses. Don't you? \n\nDo you want Hillary Clinton
    to fill Antonin Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court? Just to prove how RIGHT you
    are? \n\nYou're not that selfish and narcissistic, are you? \n\nNo. You want a
    Republican President to fill Scalia's seat, don't you? \n\nI realize you're hurting.
    But, come on. Donald Trump loves America. Hillary Clinton doesn't. Trump might
    not be a Constitutional scholar, but he's not against it. Hillary Clinton hates
    the Constitution, and you know it. \n\nDid you vote for Mitt Romney? He's to the
    left of Trump on almost everything. Did you  vote for John McCain? You don't believe
    Mitt or McCain thinks more like you than Trump thinks like you. \n\nLook, I don't
    have two purple hearts, but I've been sacrificing for this country since I was
    a kid in high school. I see a clear choice: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. I'm
    taking Trump. And I will hold to account every selfish Republican who helps Hillary
    Clinton. And will be ruthless in my prosecution of their error. Trust me."

    I stepped into this discussion hoping that you, of all people, might be able to give me a sane reason or two to trust a man from whom I have only seen third-grade level threats, lying, name-calling, and bullying; dizzying flip-flops on any actual policy issues; and profane rabble-rousing and incitement to violence and chaos. Instead, you have only echoed the shallow tribalism and hostility to any who would dare ask for some sign of an operative program that seems to define the Trump base.
    But those of us who would have liked a civil discussion of really important existential issues so that we could make intelligent, logical choices on who had the best plan going forward to recover from the mess both Dems and self-serving, faithless Republicans have left us are just threatened and insulted; "shut up, sit down and submit!" This is not acceptable leadership and not a whit better than I would expect from the communists on the other side. Tyranny is tyranny, no matter the label assumed.

    frequently. I don't, but I'm sure some do. Some bloggers contact other campaign
    staffers, too.

<p>If you've ever cheated on your spouse just to get back at your daughter for dating or marrying the wrong man, you're probably a #nevertrump person like George Will.</p>
<p>Suppose your daughter married a man you didn't approve of. You&nbsp;would probably respond by&nbsp;cheating&nbsp;on your own spouse, would you&nbsp;not? Having an affair would teach your daughter a lesson, right? And if your spouse and your friends and your other children suffered, too bad. Collateral damage is the cost of war.</p>
<p>Because Republican voters nominated a candidate the NeverTrumpers disapprove of, the NeverTrumpers say they'll politically sleep with a woman who intentionally built an email server to hide her Clinton Foundation money laundering operation from law enforcement. For example, NeverTrumper and conservative blogger <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/if-trump-is-nominated-the-gop-must-keep-him-out-of-the-white-house/2016/04/29/293f7f94-0d9d-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html">George Will plans to have an affair with Hillary Clinton</a>, the woman who pressured Obama to turn Libya into an ISIS breeding ground. Hillary Clinton, who publicly blamed the Benghazi attack on a video even after her illegal emails revealed she knew damn well it was an act of terrorism. <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/03/10/watch-hillary-clinton-call-the-mother-of-a-benghazi-victim-a-liar/">Then she called the families of Benghazi victims liars</a>. Will will sleep with Hillary Clinton who promised to put "a lot of&nbsp;coal miners and a lot of coal companies out of business," then <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-05-03/i-dont-know-how-explain-it-confused-clinton-cant-explain-own-comments-coal-miner">told an out-of-work coal miner&nbsp;h</a>e didn't hear what she said.</p>
<p>And George Will wants to sleep with this woman. Politically speaking, of course.</p>
<p>I realize George is an old man. He was old in 2009 when he warned that <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2009/04/21/George-F-Will-I-hate-jeans/stories/200904210230">blue jeans would lead to the downfall of Western Civilization</a>. Will wrote, "it is a straight line from the fall of the Bastille to the rise of denim." In the same post, Mr. Will prescribed a model of male dress that, in his view, should guide every man from here to eternity: "If Fred Astaire would not have worn it, don't wear it." (The 90 percent of you who have no idea who Fred Astaire was can look him up on Wikipedia. I guess.) That "jeans is devil-wear" column was&nbsp;the moment <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/04/16/george-will-stop-wearing-blue-jeans-you-juvenile-rabble/">level-headed people stopped taking Will seriously</a>.</p>
<p>On Monday, lead nevertrumper Bill Kristol said he'll "never say never" about voting for Trump after having said&nbsp;"never Trump" about two million times. Kristol's wisdom to walk back his never Trump statements will shine through as Donald Trump goes to work on Hillary Clinton. Benghazi and the emails will, finally, became household scandals. People old enough to remember the 1990s will sober up and realize the horrific danger to America Hillary presents.</p>
<p>Those Republicans who insist on sleeping with&nbsp;Hillary? Wear a condom. You don't want to get any on you.</p>
<p>I'm for America. I'm<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/05/03/for-trump/"> for Trump</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
