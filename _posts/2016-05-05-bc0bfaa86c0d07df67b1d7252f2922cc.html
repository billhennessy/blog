<p>Good Morning!</p>
<p>I just read some of your reviews on Amazon and appreciated your insight and candor. My name is Alyssa Puglise and I work with Robby Slaughter who is also an author of several business books. One I thought you might be interested in is The How-To Guide for Generations at Work: How Americans of Every Age View the Workplace, and How to Work Productively With Every Generation. I would like to mail you a complimentary softcover of the book or a digital copy (we have PDF, MOBI, and EPUB copies available), if you would be interested in doing an honest review of it. Of course there is no obligation to review it, but I would like to give it to you regardless. If you are interested, please respond with which copy of the book you would like and we will get the book to you ASAP. Thank you!<br />
