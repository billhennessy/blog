<p>Every prediction about Trump has been wrong. Except for two. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/05/flashback-june-19-2015-predicted-trump-win-liberal-audience-laughed/">Ann Coulter</a> and <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/131552504961/trumps-third-act-part-of-the-trump-persuasion">Scott Adams</a> predicted Trump would win the nomination and, eventually, the White House in a landslide. They were right.</p>
<p><strong>World leaders expect Trump to win</strong>, and they are lining up to make all his crazy assertions look like brilliant predictions.</p>
<p>Former Mexico president Vicente Fox apologized to Trump, and <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/05/donald-trump-vicente-fox-accept-apology/">Trump graciously accepted</a>. That's a sign that Mexicans expect Trump to become the next US president.</p>
<p>China's leaders urged everyone to treat Trump "with objectivity." That's a big change from just a few weeks ago when China was calling Trump names. China's afraid of Trump, and they want a fair deal from his administration. They know the days of conning American negotiators are coming to an end.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/05/cameron-joins-china-mexico-donald-trump-deserves-respect/">David Cameron admitted his "respect" for Donald Trump.</a>&nbsp;David Cameron realizes he'll need Trump's spine to keep England from falling to radical Islamists.</p>
<p>And House Speaker Paul Ryan demonstrated his respect for Trump by opening negotiations for a spot in Trump's cabinet. Ryan's opening position was brilliant. By saying <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/05/speaker-paul-ryan-disses-trump-im-not-ready-endorse-yet-video/">he's not yet ready&nbsp;to endorse</a> Trump, Ryan&nbsp;signaled to the master negotiator that Ryan knows how to deal. Trump earned a lot of respect for Ryan. That's why Trump responded with an official release saying that <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/05/brilliant-donald-trump-responds-paul-ryan-epic-statement/">Trump is not ready to endorse Ryan's agenda</a>. Negotiation students better keep an eye on&nbsp;this exchange. These two guys are about the top two negotiators on the planet, and Ryan will probably end up with the cabinet post of&nbsp;his choice.</p>
<p>This process will play out over the coming months. The leaders&nbsp;who've dissed and trashed Trump, now expecting him to win the White House, will join &nbsp;the negotiations Trump started last June. Those leaders with no leverage will simply fold the way Vicente Fox did. Those with some leverage will stake out a strong position like Paul Ryan. Not right away, but&nbsp;soon, all of Trump's "enemies" will be negotiating with The Donald through the media.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>everyone who doubted Trump's ability to win great deals for America will watch him practice his art on Twitter and TV</strong>. You'll love this. You'll want to help make America great again, won't you?</p>
<p>For the record, now that he is the only viable alternative to Hillary Clinton, I'm <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/05/03/for-trump/">for Trump</a>. And the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/05/04/an-affair-to-dismember/">never Trumpers are having an affair to get back at their daughters</a>.</p>
