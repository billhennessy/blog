<blockquote>You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice<br />
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice<br />
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill<br />
I will choose a path that's clear<br />
I will choose freewill</p>
<p>--RUSH, <em>Freewill</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Last July and August and once in September, I was down on Donald Trump. I predicted that a Trump nomination would be the last nail in the coffin of conservatism.</p>
<p>I was right. The<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-gop-has-a-hard-truth-to-face-conservativism-doesnt-matter-2016-5"> brilliant Ed Morrissey agrees</a>.</p>
<p>But I was wrong, too. I totally underestimated Donald Trump.</p>
<p>I read (scanned?) The Art of the Deal back in the 1990s. Had I read it carefully, I might not have made that error last July. Or I might have. I don't know.</p>
<p>But I re-read The Art of the Deal recently and realized something amazing: <strong>Donald Trump gets things done.</strong> More importantly, Donal Trump gets things done that everyone thought couldn't be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Commodore Hotel.</li>
<li>Central Park Ice Rink.</li>
<li>Trump Tower.</li>
<li>Trump Taj Mahal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The smartest executives in the industries involved said all of those magnificent projects could not possibly be completed.</p>
<p>Trump completed them.</p>
<p>Under budget</p>
<p>On time.</p>
<p><strong>Trump gets things done.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>And now he's getting this election done.</p>
<p><strong>Hillary should run in fear</strong>.</p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned Ed Morrissey. Now I'm going to share with you something Ed wrote. Something you should memorize.</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatism has to be more than a debating society. It has to offer practical improvements, and in order to do that it has to engage people where they live. <strong>For too long, the conservative movement has mainly argued philosophy and employed obstructionism while assuming the rest of country understood the stakes. As this primary has demonstrated, even many self-identified conservatives have tired of ideology and all-or-nothing politics.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Until the conservative movement rolls up its sleeves and does the hard work of engaging voters and applying solutions rather than slogans, the reaction from voters they desperately need will continue to be, &ldquo;Who cares? We have to straighten out the country.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Holy crap! That's it! That's why<strong> I don't call myself a conservative any longer</strong>. Conservatism&nbsp;has no meaning.</p>
<p><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/05/04/an-affair-to-dismember/">Look at the comments on this post</a>.&nbsp;So many members of&nbsp;the conservative debate society. Do they&nbsp;give a crap about anybody's real life problems? Sad. They can't win votes. They hate America if America stands in the way of their narrow, shallow, weak visions. Sad.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want America to be GREAT again.</li>
<li>I want my boys, who serve our country in the US Navy, to come home alive.</li>
<li>I want a military so huge that it deters aggression.</li>
<li>I want two decades without a war.</li>
<li>I want a vibrant economy.</li>
<li>I want men to be men.</li>
<li>I want women to feel safe.</li>
<li>I want a civil society.</li>
<li>I want to speak my mind.</li>
<li>I want my grandchildren to believe life only gets better.</li>
<li>I want good jobs for people who don't have&nbsp;advanced degrees.</li>
<li><strong>I want America to be great again.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <strong>I endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States</strong>. Because&nbsp;he's the only sonofabitch&nbsp;in this race who wants those things to happen.</p>

<p>Now, before you hate on me, watch this. Watch it to the end:</p>
