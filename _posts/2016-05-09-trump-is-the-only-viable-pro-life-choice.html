  content: "Let's flashback to 2008...\n\n\"Chances are Congress won&rsquo;t introduce
    any major abortion laws in the next four years. That means the abortion battle
    will remain in the courts.\n\nNow, we can&rsquo;t say for sure whether the GOP
    or Democrats will control the next Senate. But we can accurately predict this:
    if Obama is the next president, the Supreme Court will be mostly liberal for a
    generation.\n\nObama is a big fan of abortion on demand, and he&rsquo;s vowed
    to appoint judges and justices who will overrule state and federal laws that restrict
    abortions. I know Obama lies a lot, but I bet he&rsquo;s telling the truth about
    this.\n\nA McCain win keeps the high court mostly conservative.\n\nI have no way
    of knowing how many more abortions will happen if Obama wins, but I&rsquo;m pretty
    confident in predicting that an Obama win mean more unborn babies will die than
    if McCain wins.\n\nIf you&rsquo;re pro-life, the choice is pretty simple: support
    McCain or the baby gets it.\"\n\nI'm as pro-life as they come, but this is the
    same line of reasoning we've had to swallow for the past two election cycles whilst
    holding our noses and casting a vote for a so-call \"conservative\" GOP nominee
    \"because at least we would get pro-life justices.\" That turned out so very well.
    At least those guys had some (albeit limited) conservative credentials. Only thing
    was, we were never really given much of a choice to begin with in '08 and '12.
    \n\nThis time around there were more than a dozen solidly conservative AND pro-life
    GOP candidates to choose from, and we're left a fatcat New York liberal who's
    the only one on record saying great things about Planned Parenthood and that women
    should be punished for having an abortion. Trump makes Romney (who himself flip-flopped
    on abortion) look like Fr. Frank Pavone.\n\nWe had our chance to choose a strong
    pro-life nominee in 2016 and we blew it. You can do all the mental gymnastics
    you want to justify your support for Trump. Just don't hurt yourself on your backflip.
    As for me, I'm out. The pro-life issue is just the start of my qualms with Trump.
    But it's a non-starter in this case.\n\nOh, and you're assuming Trump even has
    a chance. One look at the electoral map and it's shaping up to be a landslide.
    Just like '08. Just like '12. But probably worse.\n\nSo, it's a false dichotomy
    to say Trump or dead babies. What you've done is arrive at an invalid conclusion
    stemming from two false premises.\n\nAs your new-found \"conservative\" standard
    bearer would say: \"Sad!\""

  content: Was there a vacancy on the Supreme Court in May 2008? And, if so, was the
    vacancy caused by a reliable pro-life justices departure? If not, I don't get
    your point, Gabe. It's late, I'm on the road, and I'm not necessarily the sharpest
    tool in the shed.

<p>Some pro-life activists like Erick Erickson are plotting ways to sabotage Donald Trump's candidacy for president. They probably haven't stopped to think. If they succeed in defeating Trump, they will be culpable in many, many abortions. That's a lot of guilt for a guy like Erickson to carry around, isn't it?</p>
<p>Chances are Congress won't introduce any major abortion laws in the next four years. That means the abortion battle will remain in the courts.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is made up of four relatively conservative justices and four relatively liberal ones. That means there's a vacancy on the court. Antonin Scalia died in February, leaving an open seat. Scalia was probably the most conservative justice. (For a breakdown on <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/04/02/strategist-looks-supreme-court-nomination/">the Supreme Court's ideological future, click</a>.) President Obama appointed a replacement for Scalia, but the Senate probably won't vote on that nomination.</p>
<p>That means <strong>the next president will appoint Scalia's replacement</strong>, and that appointment will decide whether the court goes mostly right or mostly left.</p>
<p>Now, we can't say for sure whether the GOP or Democrats will control the next Senate. But we can accurately predict this: <strong>if Clinton is the next president, the Supreme Court will be mostly liberal for a generation</strong>.</p>
<p>Clinton is a big fan of abortion on demand, and she's vowed to appoint judges and justices who will overrule&nbsp;state and federal laws that restrict abortions. I know Hillary lies a lot, but I bet she's telling the truth about this.</p>
<p>Donald Trump says he's working with the Heritage Foundation to create a list of excellent conservative jurists to replace Scalia and any other vacancies that occur during his presidency. He's even open to appointing Ted Cruz to the Supreme Court. That probably means a Trump win keeps the high court mostly conservative.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing how many more abortions will happen if Clinton wins, but I'm pretty confident in predicting that <strong>a Clinton win mean more unborn babies will die than if Trump wins</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're pro-life, the choice is pretty simple: support Trump or the&nbsp;baby gets it.</p>
