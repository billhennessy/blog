    I like Jonah Goldberg's writing. He's funny and intelligent. His emotions are in control right now, but he'll be back before long.

    If Trump wins, we'll need Jonah's brilliant pen to keep him in line and to encourage Congress to send President Trump bills that advance conservative solutions to problems Trump raises in the campaign.

  content: I hope Cruz NEVER endorses this pathetic Liberal Hack Trump. Trump is a
    Con man with zero principles. He lies daily and media never calls him on it. I
    will be Writing in CRUZ. I personally would be upset see a principled man such
    as Cruz endorse this FRUAD. Trump has tried to tarnish CRUZ name, His wife's name
    and his Fathers name. I doubt Bill would "endorse" such a liar if his own family
    was attacked. WOW just can't believe I am reading this garbage here.

  content: I'm 100% with you. Jonah Goldberg's list of principles is highly disordered?
    What about Trump's list of principles? Does he have a list? Does he even have
    one single principle? I don't see how any intelligent, principled person can support
    Trump.

    when he was attacked first and no one lied as much as Cruz did ever.

    What has Jonah Goldberg contributed to the world? My guess is not much.

    Ted Cruz has indeed broken his pledge to the GOP. He should be expelled where he can go on to start a new party. A good name for the new party is Butthurt Loserheads.

  content: "I wanted a principled conservative also. But it seems no matter how i
    vote, it never happens anyway. I voted for a few principled conservative last
    election. What did i get? A republican house and senate that could not do anything.
    Obama-care stood and was even funded. This crazy AG who the republicans confirmed
    is part of a group trying to use racketeering laws against those who speak out
    against climate change, the largest fraud of out time. She is also part of the
    transgender bathroom BS now. I watch time and time again, waiting for them to
    make a stand and draw a line, and it never happens. I have voted conservative
    for years, and i never get a conservative. I always seem to get something else.
    \n\nThinking about it, trump is no worse than what i already have gotten. Do i
    know exactly what he is going to do? No. Can he keep his word on what he said
    he would do? I have no idea, but if he does with 10% of it, he had a better record
    than those who won last election. At least he is a proud nationalist, something
    that seems to have become a bad word these days. He is also a capitalist. Thats
    a start for me. What i do know is what Hillary and Bernie will do. I will take
    trump any day over those 2. If these are my choices so be it. so please be my
    guess than write in Cruz. But if the democrat wins your state by a real close
    margin, remember you wasted your vote.  I myself am more concerned with Hillary
    and Bern."

  content: I supported Ted Cruz until Trump became the presumptive nominee. Also,
    Trump can win states that Cruz could not. So, I am now supporting Donald Trump,
    who was my second choice, because I truly care about the direction this country
    is headed. I do not want to hear from any anti-Trump people about how Conservative
    they are or how concerned they are with the direction this country is headed if
    they would rather see a corrupt, liar in Killary become president. Trump or Killary?
    You choose. Will the country be better off with Donald Trump as president, making
    America Great again, or Killary Clinton, who will continue on the path of destruction
    for the country with the DemonRAT'S policies? I will go with Trump! You should
    too. Wake up!

    the nominee and not go Third party?  Trump did not take the oath that night, but
    did so later on. Now what? That is one of the reasons people are upset. Their
    words mean nothing. These politicians take an oath to uphold the Constitution
    and then fail at that. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/QRiy4YAwXlM"

<p>You've probably been hearing a lot about "principles" lately. Ted Cruz's entire campaign centered "conservative principles" and being a "principled conservative."</p>
<p>Lately, though, most of that "principles" talk is about how Donald Trump has caused good conservatives to abandon their principles.</p>
<p>Maybe that's true. In fact, I'm starting to believe it.</p>
<p><strong>The one principle that many conservatives have abandoned and encouraged others to abandon: keeping your word.</strong></p>
<p>The lead advocate for abandoning this principle of keeping one's word is Jonah Goldberg of <em>National Review</em> and the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Every Republican candidate for president signed an oath to support the party's nominee</strong>. An oath. The oath-signing ceremony was a knee-jerk reaction to Donald Trump's insistence that he might not support the nominee. Isn't it ironic that the oath meant to keep Trump from running as an independent now morally obligates all of his opponents to support him?&nbsp;And all 17 Republican candidates &nbsp;signed the oath which reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>I (name) affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is. I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, the oath is not legally binding. But another principle that many conservatives admire is the principle of doing what's right, not just what's legal.&nbsp;That promise was not made to Donald Trump; it was made to the Republican Party and to the people. While the oath is not legally binding, it is morally binding.</p>
<p><strong>I thought conservatives believed in moral principles.</strong></p>
<p>Now, Jonah Goldberg and other conservatives want the Republican candidates to break their oaths. Goldberg seems to believe that it's okay to abandon a lower principle to defend a higher principle. That's probably true. But I think Jonah and many other conservatives operate from a disordered list of principles.</p>
<p>In my thinking, <strong>principles of personal conduct rank far above principles of political philosophy</strong>.</p>
<h3>Principles of Government</h3>
<p>When people talk about "conservative principles," they're usually talking about principles of government or political philosophy. "That which governs least governs best," is a conservative principle of governance.</p>
<p>Those principles of government, while important, provide almost no information on how men and women like you and me should behave. The only information about personal behavior is in how we instruct our governments. Because&nbsp;we live in a democratic republic, it's our job to cajole the government to govern least.</p>
<p>In all other ways, principles of government cover how other people should behave, not us. That's a pretty low set of principles.</p>
<h3>Principles of Personal Conduct</h3>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum are principles of personal conduct. These are the highest principles, not the lowest. Politicians who lack principles of personal conduct cannot be trusted with limited government. We teach children to keep their word long before we teach them principles of government. That's telling, is it not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="slide-title">"Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power."</p>
<p class="slide-title">&mdash; Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, now we're told&nbsp;to break our written vows to promote a philosophy of government? The great philosophers would be appalled. From Aristotle to Epicurus to Seneca and beyond, the great philosophers taught us that <strong>men must govern themselves before attempting to govern others.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>"it is more important for you to keep the resolutions you have already made than to go on and make noble ones."</p>
<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Seneca</p></blockquote>
<p>These principles of personal conduct, then, are clearly superior to principles of government. Yet Jonah Goldberg encourages men like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to break their pledges. He exalts men like Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham for violating the contracts they signed. And <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/05/14/rick-perry-attacked-keeping-word/">Goldberg&nbsp;ridicules men who keep their word, like Rick Perry</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Jonah Goldberg's list of principles&nbsp;is highly disordered.</strong></p>
<p>I'll leave you with this: For two years I've heard from friends that we can trust Ted Cruz to keep his word because he's never broken his promises. <strong>Cruz's&nbsp;PACs were called "Keeping the Promise."</strong> Yet, if Ted Cruz fails to endorse Donald Trump, his honesty streak will end. What have we gained if we promote our philosophy of government by abandoning our philosophy of personal conduct?</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Some commenters on Twitter seem to believe Cruz is free to break his pledge because of Trump's behavior after Cruz signed it. But Ted Cruz disagrees with that thinking. He told reporters in March (via <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/03/14/ted_cruz_vows_to_honor_his_pledge_to_support_gop_nominee_despite_violence_at_donald_trump_rallies_on_one_condition/">Salon</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shocking concept to members of the media,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that an elected official actually does what he says, [but] at the outset of this campaign,<strong> I committed [to] support[ing] the Republican nominee, and I honor my word</strong>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Cruz did allow one exception: "If&nbsp;he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump," Cruz said. As far as I know, Trump hasn't shot anybody on Fifth Avenue.</p>
