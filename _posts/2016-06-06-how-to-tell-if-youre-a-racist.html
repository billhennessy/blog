  content: Trump banning Muslims. It is just not Trump calling for banning Muslims.
    It is the security heads in the Obama Regime that said there is a threat of ISIS
    infiltrating the Syrian "refugees, &ldquo;endangering American citizens. It is
    the Obama Regime, along with the RINO's, that want to let them in unvetted. BTW
    The banning of Muslims has happened before in this country. Furthermore, Muslims
    will not assimilate into the American culture and Sharia Law is not compatible
    with the US Constitution. Islam is a political and military system masquerading
    as a religion. Muslims can lie to the infidel to promote Islam. The Muslim Brotherhood
    calls for a &ldquo;Civilization-Jihadist Process,&rdquo; in which they would destroy
    the Western civilization from within. They said they would use the Constitution
    against the US to further their agenda. Their goal is World Islam. Muslims believe
    the infidels will have to convert to Islam, be enslaved or be killed. They state,
    we do not want to democratize Islam, we want to Islamize democracy. That is what
    we want. &ldquo;We Will Raise The Flag Of Allah In The White House&rdquo; I believe
    it has already been raised from the actions of Barack Hussein Obama as president
    and his Muslim Brotherhood advisers. Their prophet Mohammed was a pedophile rapist
    and mass murderer. And they will try to push Sharia law if the American people
    do not wake up. Again, Islam is not compatible with the US Constitution and the
    American culture. Look at what has been happening in Europe with the invasion
    of Muslims into the various countries.

    The original comments were not "is it possible." He said it is "absolutely a conflict" and that the conflict of interest was because, "I'm building a wall. It's an inherent conflict of interest." Implicitly, he is saying that a Mexican judge cannot be impartial against him. Not, as you prognosticate here, this individual (not actually Mexican) judge. This is stupid on two levels: (1) Suggesting that someone who has taken an oath of office to actually BE a judge does not understand the need to stay impartial is insulting them professionally. (2) Aside from that, Trump's assumption that no Mexican or Mexican descendant could care about strong borders or Making America Great Again. He jumps straight over that and into Nixonian paranoia that his political rhetoric will affect the outcome of the trial SOLELY BASED on the race of the judge.

    A more cynical person (such as myself) might say this is actually strategic damage control. Trump knows he is going to lose, and needs a scapegoat his supporters can believe in. By planting the seed that the judge is biased, he's already anticipating the opponents' next move and moved to counter it. This way, even though Republicans are head-first diving out of the way of this comment, Trump can play the victim card after he loses to say, "I told you this judge was biased. Of course we are going to appeal and have this overturned. And I'l win that appeal because I'm a winner." And the appeals process will take much longer than November. He will probably also proclaim all of the people that are not standing with him now, like Ryan and Graham, were "spineless" or "didn't look at the facts," or whatever he says at that point. He's giving himself an out, whether legitimate or not.

    Conversely, if he wins the case, he will be, "Really proud of Judge Curiel" for "rising above" all the "haters."

    After a few months of watching this guy, you can kind of write it, yourself, honestly. That's why I despise him. He has played the race card on behalf of white folks, and it is working. People who for years deplored the racial identity politics of the Left and Obama have simply fallen for the same gag when the racial identity benefits rich white dudes. Everything the Left has said for two generations about the racism of the Republican Party - accusations I fought for decades! - is manifest in Trump.

    Vote for Gary Johnson - the only adult voice on the ballot in November.

  content: "Zack,\n\nJudge Curiel is 100% racist. He works for La Raza, which is Spanish
    for The Race. Curiel dreams, breathes, and eats racism. And he's okay with being
    a racist. He admits it. Hell, Curiel brags about being a racist. \n\nSo Trump
    was brilliant to call out the racist judge who should totally be removed from
    the bench and probably disbarred. \n\n\nThanks for agreeing with me."

    Bill,
    You are better than this. Come on. "La Raza" also means "community" in context, and he belongs to a Hispanic association of Lawyers, not a street gang. He was born in Indiana. How do you get more whitebread than Indiana?

    You wouldn't fall for this triangulating BS with ANY other politician of ANY political stripe. Why Trump? I hate to see to original Tea Partiers carrying water for this blowhard. In 2009, it was about liberty, the Constitution, and Founding Principles. Trump doesn't embody ANY of that - he's a dictator-in-waiting. You are a student of history. You should know that he sounds every authoritarian alarm bell, flag, and siren we have ever been warned about. From Orwell to Bradbury to Lincoln to Madison all the way back to PLATO. He embodies 6 of the 7 deadly sins. I just don't get how conservatives have one toe aboard the Trump Train, much less have jumped all-in.

    Sorry, that got a little ranty.
    Peace.

<p>You've probably heard the news that Donald Trump believes it's possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly. Do you think Trump is wrong about this?</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter if Trump believed it would be possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly, Trump answered, "It&rsquo;s possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely."</p>
<p>Notice that Trump didn't say, "all Muslim judges are unfair to me." Nor did he say all Hispanic judges are unfair. He said it's possible for some judges to treat him unfairly, even they're Muslim or Hispanic.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/06/06/muslim-judge/">Read more on this subject here.</a>]</p>
<p>Let's drop the modifier "Muslim" and talk about judges for a moment.</p>
<p>Do you believe any judge has ever been unfair to anyone who came before their bench? If you know a couple who got divorced, I'll bet at least one of that pair says the judge was unfair. Maybe both. Christian conservatives tell me the judges on the Supreme Court were unfair in deciding gay marriage and ObamaCare. And a ton of people think judges sometimes sentence black defendants more harshly than white defendants in nearly identical cases. And there's more.</p>
<p>My Irish friends believe judges in the United States treated their ancestors unfairly when it came to property law, labor law, and criminal law. Some Italians believe judges treat them harshly because of the Mafia. And every time an appeals court reverses a lower court ruling, the judges on the appeals court believe the lower court did something unfair. That happens a lot, you know. Also, judges have been removed from the bench for things like taking bribes and colluding with police to hide evidence. And some people believe <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra?utm_term=.uavDL9zEW0#.go4mRLXW2a">a judge was unfair for giving a tiny sentence to a rapist</a> because a longer sentence might have hurt the rapist's swimming career.</p>
<p>At this point, any reasonable person would agree that it's possible for judges to treat people unfairly.</p>
<p>Now, then, are some judges immune to unfairness? In other words, let's say we sorted all the judges in the United States into two buckets: one bucket of judges who've never been unfair, and another bucket of judges who have been unfair. Next, let's look at various traits these judges have and see if we can find any strong correlations. In other words, do the fair judges share any traits that the unfair judges do not? Try to imagine what those traits might be. Height, weight, time on the bench, law school, etc. Just for kicks, let's do like the government does and consider race, ethnicity, sex, and religious preferences, too.</p>
<p>[Tweet "If you believe Donald Trump is wrong about Muslim judges, you're probably a racist."]</p>
<p>What are the chances that a not single unfair judge would be Muslim or Hispanic? I have no idea if it's true, but the people who believe Trump was wrong must believe Muslim judges and Hispanic judges are genetically incapable of being unfair. There's no other explanation. People who are upset at Trump believe&nbsp;that all Muslim and Hispanic judges are genetically fair to everyone.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the dictionary definition of racism:</p>
<blockquote><p>a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race</p>
<p>[source <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism">Merriam-Webster</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>So Donald Trump believes that Muslims and Hispanics are capable of unfairness, just like everybody else. Supreme Court Justice Sonia <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/us/15judge.html">Sotomayor also believe a judge's ethnicity influences her rulings</a>, so she agrees with Trump. People who are mad at Trump believe Muslims and Hispanics possess traits and capabilities, like fairness, primarily attributable their their race. Who's the racist here?</p>
<p>If you believe Donald Trump is wrong about Muslim judges, you're probably a racist.</p>
