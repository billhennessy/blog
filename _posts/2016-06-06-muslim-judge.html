  content: A Muslim Judge takes an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, but
    they also take an oath to Islam and Sharia law.  Muslims will not assimilate into
    the American culture and Sharia Law is not compatible with the US Constitution.
    Islam is a political and military system masquerading as a religion. Muslims can
    lie to the infidel to promote Islam. The Muslim Brotherhood calls for a &ldquo;Civilization-Jihadist
    Process,&rdquo; in which they would destroy the Western civilization from within.
    They said they would use the Constitution against the US to further their agenda.
    Their goal is World Islam. Muslims believe the infidels will have to convert to
    Islam, be enslaved or be killed. They state, we do not want to democratize Islam,
    we want to Islamize democracy. That is what we want. &ldquo;We Will Raise The
    Flag Of Allah In The White House&rdquo; I believe it has already been raised from
    the actions of Barack Hussein Obama as president and his Muslim Brotherhood advisers.
    Their prophet Mohammed was a pedophile rapist and mass murderer. And they will
    try to push Sharia law if the American people do not wake up. Again, Islam is
    not compatible with the US Constitution and the American culture. Look at what
    has been happening in Europe with the invasion of Muslims into the various countries.

<p>Has any judge, anywhere, ever presided unfairly over a trial?</p>
<p>The leftist press is making hay over Donald Trump's reasonable assertion that a Muslim judge might not be able to fairly adjudicate a case involving Trump.</p>
<p>The answer to my opening question is "yes." Many judges have presided unfairly&nbsp;over trials. For example, many blacks were sent to prison when the same evidence would have exonerated a white defendant. We all know that. So we all know that judges are capable of unfair treatment at trial.</p>
<p>Are Muslim judges immune from unfairness? If you say they are, you're kind of a racist, are you not? To say that all judges are capable of unfairness except Muslim judges is like saying all accountants are capable of math errors except Jewish accountants.</p>
<p>Could you be more bigoted?</p>
<p>Donald Trump has broken the rules of political correctness when it comes to Muslims and Hispanics. It's reasonable to assume that Muslim and Hispanic judges would treat Mr. Trump unfairly in their courtrooms. In fact, many people would expect them to. Some vile people even encourage them to.</p>
<p>Besides, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/12/09/america-is-for-americans/">most Muslims in America believe they should be subject to sharia law</a> instead of the US Constitution. So most Muslims admit they'd be unfair to Donald Trump, a Presbyterian.</p>
