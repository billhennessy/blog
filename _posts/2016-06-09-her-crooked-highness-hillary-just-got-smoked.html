<p>Trump is now running unopposed for president because his only opponent is an empty pantsuit.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton uses other people's money to surround herself with nearly 1,000 paid staff. Direct paid staff. That a HUGE support team for a crooked sexist like Hillary.</p>
<p>Donald Trump spends his own money, so he hires only enough people to get the job done. Trump understands money and people, while Hillary understands comfort.</p>
<p>Tonight, Hillary Clinton exposed herself as an amateur in the world of communication. Just read this and enjoy:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama&mdash;but nobody else does!</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/740972317191352320">June 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Crooked Hillary's response:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p>
Delete your account. <a href="https://t.co/Oa92sncRQY">https://t.co/Oa92sncRQY</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/740973710593654784">June 9, 2016</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Next President's response:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted? <a href="https://t.co/gECLNtQizQ">https://t.co/gECLNtQizQ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/741007091947556864">June 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Hat Tip to <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/06/trump-gets-last-laugh-crookedhillarys-snarky-swipe-twitter/">Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit, for this great exchange</a> that probably ended Hillary's political career.</p>
<p>Watching Trump battle Hillary is like watching Sugar Ray Leonard fight a high school kid. It's not even a fair fight. It's embarrassing.</p>
<p>Trump is the Einstein of persuasion, and Hillary couldn't even persuade her husband not to rape women. It's not fair.</p>
<p>That's why <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/05/13/how-to-predict-trumps-landslide-win/">Trump will win in a landslide</a>, probably before November.</p>
