<p>Good morning, Bill!</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Laura and I work with the US Tax Center, a company serving as an educational hub for people with tax questions and providing e-filing services.</p>
<p>It seems like we&rsquo;ve been talking about the 2016 presidential election for a while now, but there are only a few months left until voters select the nation&rsquo;s next president. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been sparring on a variety of issues for months, including the topic of taxes.</p>
<p>Both candidates recently proposed tax plans meant to help the middle class, but what they don&rsquo;t talk about is how those plans might actually impact your paycheck. Luckily, our team has put together an infographic highlighting that information, and the results in one candidate&rsquo;s words could be &ldquo;YUGE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me know if you&rsquo;d like to take a look at the graphic and I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>Have a great day,<br />
