<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A friend and colleague paid me a huge compliment recently. A compliment I didn't deserve. He said something about trying to mimic my writing style. That's an ego-booster, for sure, but, well, I don&rsquo;t really have a writing style. I cheat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">See, I experiment with every writing tool I hear about, and I stick with the ones that measurably improve my writing. Especially when they work as I write (because I hate editing and revision, as you can tell).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://gram.ly/nXBV">Grammarly</a> is a tool I started using recently. It&rsquo;s awesome.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, I used <a href="http://gram.ly/nXBV">Grammarly</a> as a lazy citation tool. I&rsquo;d write my paper, then run it through their plagiarism checker, which would point me to all the great research that I accidentally referenced. Then I&rsquo;d grab the citations, mark up my copy, and produce a sickeningly well-documented paper that actually just expressed my own opinion. Like I said, I cheat.</span></p>
<p class="p1">But now I've found their Chrome plug-in that monitors my writing even while it's in progress. Since I do most of my writing in a browser, <a href="http://gram.ly/nXBV">Grammarly</a> never stops correcting me. And that's a good thing.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you use Chrome and write in the browser (even Outlook online), <a href="http://gram.ly/nXBV">Grammarly</a> will give you real-time feedback and great suggestions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plus, it&rsquo;s gamified. Every week I get a scorecard that shows me how my writing compares to tens of thousands of other <a href="http://gram.ly/nXBV">Grammarly</a> users. (If I&rsquo;d been in the bottom 50 percent of anything, I wouldn&rsquo;t have posted this. Trust me.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19716" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-20-23.39.39.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-06-20 23.39.39" width="553" height="781" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19717" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-20-23.40.22.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-06-20 23.40.22" width="554" height="212" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So if you really want to mimic my writing (and you probably shouldn't), you have to use all the cheats I use. (<a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Editor </a>is another.)</span></p>
<p class="p1">P.S. I get a free month of <a href="http://gram.ly/nXBV">Grammarly</a> Premium if you try <a href="http://gram.ly/nXBV"><strong>Grammarly</strong></a>. I hope you do, for my sake. :-)</p>
