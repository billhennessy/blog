  content: Great persuasion question. You're probably right. I don't care. I care
    about the things that matter, namely preserving the culture that made limited
    government possible. As long as he does that, I'll happily debate the fine points
    later.

  content: "Great podcast. \n\nIt's probably likely that Trump is more liberal in
    some areas than he portrays. What do you think those areas might be?"

  content: Thanks! You must know a lot about persuasion judging by the way you set
    up your question. I'm mostly concerned with Trump's broad understanding that the
    American culture is under attack and we need to conserve our way of life. Once
    we're secure, we can get back to the finer points of policy. But if we lose the
    battle for our cultural core, the other points won't matter.
