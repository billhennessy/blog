<p>A lot of people are mad at FBI Director James Comey. Comey read a list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, then announced he couldn't recommend prosecution for those crimes. On its face, it sounds like Comey caved.</p>
<p><strong>Let's play the imagine game</strong>. Imagine Comey decided to refer Hillary Clinton's crimes to the Department of Justice for prosecution. What would happen?</p>
<p>First, you'd never hear about it. The FBI and the DOJ don't discuss active criminal investigations. There would be no official statement of any kind. Disgruntled FBI agents would probably leak some of the details to the press, but most people would dismiss these leaks with the help of <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/07/06/why-youre-mad-at-trump/">brain manipulation by the press</a>. Loretta Lynch, the <strong>Attorney General who was ambushed by Bill Clinton</strong>, would have no incentive to act on the recommendation. Lynch would also have no reason to dismiss it. Lynch's best strategy, had Comey recommended prosecution, would be to do nothing, saying nothing. It'll all be over in a few months.</p>
<p>Had Comey recommended prosecution, you'd probably never hear about the matter again except for conservative talk shows and blogs. <strong>That huge pool of voters who don't pay much attention to politics wouldn't know that Hillary put American lives in grave danger in violation of federal law.</strong></p>
<p>But Comey took a different path. Comey recited, point by point, each of <strong>Hillary's crimes</strong>. He left absolutely no doubt about <strong>Hillary's guilt</strong>. James Comey <strong>convicted Hillary Clinton of crimes</strong>&nbsp;without the burden of a prosecution. And Hillary has passed up her chance to refute any of the charges. She made one feeble attempt to lie about Comey, but she got caught on that, too.</p>
<p>Comey's reputation is taking a beating, but Comey might have done something heroic. If you saw his Congressional testimony, Comey agreed with every point Trey Gowdy made. <strong>That damning video is below. You will want to watch it in a moment.</strong></p>
<p>Comey did not seem angry at Gowdy's questioning. Comey did not act like Lois Lerner, the IRS bureaucrat&nbsp;who tried to have Tea Partiers arrested as part of a political war on conservatives. Instead, Comey seemed very cooperative. He seemed to want people to<strong> conclude that Hillary&nbsp;Clinton is guilty as sin.</strong> After Comey's testimony, a reasonable person must conclude that either Hillary Clinton is a crook or Hillary Clinton is an imbecile.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm being too nice to the FBI Director. Or maybe <strong>James Comey just threw the election to Donald Trump</strong>. Either way, even Hillary's most ardent supporters privately admit <strong>she's a corrupt and crooked person.</strong></p>
