<p>You know how this game goes. You make a wish, I'll do my damnedest to grant it. Because I am just that <del>kink</del>&nbsp; kind of guy.</p>
<p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg, aka Notorious RBG, made a&nbsp;wish last week. Being a lawyer, her wish came with a contingency.</p>
<p>I just launched a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg">GoFund.</a>Me<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg"> project to grant her that wish</a>. And why not?</p>
<p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a true Horatio Alger story. Born to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, raised in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, RBG rose the highest legal position in the United States: Supreme Court Justice.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>She wasn't quite the first woman. Republican Sandra Day O'Connor beat her. But she was a woman. And a very, very liberal woman at that.</p>
<p>Now, she's asked for America's help. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg"><strong>She wants to retire to New Zealand</strong></a>. Hell, who doesn't. But on a government pension and in advanced years, golden years&nbsp;in the land near Oz is a bit of stretch for the daugther of immigrants.</p>
<p>You have a chance to grant this old woman's dream. But there's a catch.</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg imposed a contingency on her dream retirement: she'll only move to New Zealand if Donald Trump wins.</p>
<p>I can help. As usual.</p>
<p>My GoFund.Me project seeks to aim $25,000 to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg">move RBG to New Zealand</a>. Every penny over $25,000 will go help elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>If we raise $50,000, $25k goes to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's move and $25k goes to Trump.</p>
<p>Please give generously. Our republic could depend on it.</p>
