  content: He does not support SJR 39, I do.  &ldquo;The economic fear tactics are
    not going to work on us,&rdquo; said Curtman, adding that those worries are &ldquo;unsubstantiated.&rdquo;
    He echoed sentiments expressed on one supporter&rsquo;s sign, which read &ldquo;The
    First Amendment is not for sale.&rdquo;  you should not have to bake a cake for
    something that is truly against your religion.

  content: I agree with you and with Curtman . . . but that's not my number one priority.
    My number one priority is blowing up the establishment, and only Greitens will
    do that. Only Greitens.

  content: That remains to be seen.  In the meantime people all over this country
    are losing their religious freedom and may be gone forever if something isn't
    done expeditiously.  People have lost their business, their money, and even some
    their home threatened all because they are targeted and then sued by gay activist.

  content: And every Missourian loses freedom every through government corruption.
    Every dollar that's taxed away from you and given to politician's favorite company
    is a theft of freedom and property. That is my number one concern.

  content: 'You don''t *know* that Trump and Greitens will blow up the establishment.  You
    *hope* they do.  Nearly all who enter the DC boundaries become seduced by power,
    influence and money.  Is Donald immune to the seduction of power (hint: he''s
    clearly more drawn to it than most of us)?  How well do you*know* Mr. Greitens
    and those who fund him?  We all have a choice to make but let''s be clear eyed.'

  content: "The hope that the likes of Greitens and Trump will \"blow up\" the political
    establishment is about as naive as the belief so many held that Obama would promote
    positive \"change.\" We can be cautiously optimistic (maybe), but when all other
    options become the complete death and destruction of American culture/the economy/freedom/whatever,
    and when refusing to support your candidate is akin to working towards the collapse
    of liberty, we start to lapse into the hero worship that the left devolved into
    in '08. \n\nYour article has all the makings of the weird pseudo-worship, intellectual
    dishonesty, and general panic that fuels so many Trump supporters, only projected
    onto Greitens:\n\n1. Reagan comparison\n2. Over-the-top metaphor concerning the
    imminent collapse of America (we will survive a Brunner or Kinder governorship,
    as well as four years of Hillary) \n3. Hurried and shallow dismissal of any shortcomings
    or blemishes in his record \n4. Dramatic rhetoric to appeal to emotion (labeling
    Americans as \"slaves\" to the political class--yawn)\n\nThis brings me to a broader
    point: I get it--you've decided Trump is the one to beat Hillary, and it's worth
    sacrificing your principles for the off-chance that an entrenched elite decides
    to blow-up Washington, D.C. But you don't have stoop this low. This kind of formulaic
    article isn't going to convince anyone. In other words--don't try to convince
    people Donald Trump is a good guy and a good conservative, because no one worth
    your time really thinks he is. This is about stopping Hillary; don't demean our
    collective intelligence by editing biographies and leaning on bombastic rhetoric.\n\nEDIT:
    A final thought. Time and time again, throughout this article, the comments, and
    other posts, you assert that your goal is to \"destroy the political establishment.\"
    Ok, that's all well and good. But you understand that there will never *not* be
    a political establishment, yes? There is always an establishment, and always an
    opposition. When does your crusade end? When you like the establishment? When
    you become the establishment? How will you keep the new establishment honest,
    and why will it work on the new one, but not the current one? You warn against
    becoming a permanent remnant, but it seems like if you're not the opposition,
    you're the establishment. Let's move beyond vague buzz words."

  content: I see nothing in this man's past that assures me he can correct corruption.  I
    think my religious freedom trumps the very small amount of money I give to to
    the state of Missouri thru taxes.  Iowa just announced they will consider churches
    as public thus turning their bathrooms over to perverts.

<p>I believe the greatest threat to human freedom and thriving is the political class. That smirking political class infects both Washington, DC, and Jefferson City, Missouri. And I believe only one candidate has the courage, the brains, and the commitment to destroy that political class in Missouri. That candidate is Eric Greitens.</p>
<p>Do you want to live as a slave to that smirking political class? Or do you want to live free and thrive?</p>
<p>Three Republican candidates for governor have crawled to the political class for help. One has not. That one is Eric Greitens.</p>
<p>Some of my friends attack Mr. Greitens, even on the St. Louis Tea Party blog, which I operate and fund. I let their attacks go out, under my name, not because I agree, but because I trust the people.</p>
<p>We have a simple policy for the contributors to that blog: write what you believe. If other contributors disagree, they can write what they believe. The people will sort it out. So, now, it's my turn.</p>
<h3>Remnant No More</h3>
<p>Many Tea Partiers want to remain political remnants. Political martyrs. Slaves to a self-imposed conformity. Self-righteous worshippers at the altar of the smirking political class. I know their feelings because I was a remnant for most of my life.</p>
<p>The president of the American Enterprise Institute, Dr. Arthur C. Brooks, explained the phenomenon in his book <a href="http://amzn.to/29y8HPz"><em>The Conservative Heart</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tea Party rebellion, and the conservative grassroots it has energized, thus have some choices to make: Does it want to remain at step one, settle for 19 percent support (and falling), and become a permanent political remnant&mdash; capable of setting political brushfires, but too weak to bring about real lasting change in our nation? Or does it want to make a run at majority status and build a popular social movement that changes our country forever? <strong>Do Tea Party activists want to remain little more than the guardian of fiscally conservative orthodoxy holding the Republican establishment&rsquo;s feet to the fire?</strong> Or can the Tea Party become something bigger&mdash; a transformational, majoritarian force in American politics that does not simply rebel against American decline, but reverses it?</p>
<p>The truth is, <strong>if we want to reverse American decline, and not just rail against it, then we do in fact need a conservative majority to prevail</strong>. That requires that Tea Party patriots start thinking like a majoritarian social movement.</p></blockquote>
<p>A vote for anyone other than Eric Greitens is a vote for permanent remnant status.</p>
<p>Yes, Eric Greitens began life as a Democrat, just like Ronald Reagan did. Yes, Eric Greitens applauded Democrats' speeches, just like Ronald Reagan did. Yes, Eric Greitens wrote in support of big government programs, just like Ronald Reagan did.</p>
<p>But Eric Greitens has seen fit to move to the right because he's seen the damage done by the policies he once endorsed. Sensible people would help him make those corrections. Eric Greitens is fully equipped and prepared to fix Missouri.</p>
<p>The more Eric sees government in action, the more he seeks to restrain government.</p>
<p>Just like Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>And <strong>Greitens is the only Republican likely to beat the Democrat in November</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Political Class Bleeds and Chokes Conservatism</h3>
<p>Eric's opponents in this race have two things in common:</p>
<ol>
<li>They're (mostly) good people who love America and recite the conservative credo by heart.</li>
<li>
<p>They've all pledged allegiance to the smirking political class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as that smirking political class holds sway in Jefferson City, our limited-government movement&nbsp;will remain a remnant, a faction, of frustrated grassroots activists waving signs that no one else reads or understands.</p>
<p>That's why I believe Americans have a duty to blow up the political class first.</p>
<h3>Combat First Aid</h3>
<p>In military first aid class, we learned a three-step system for treating seriously injured shipmates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the bleeding.</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p>Start the breathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treat for shock.</p>
</li>
<p>The smirking political class is a sucking chest wound on this country. It's bleeding us dry. Until we stop that bleeding, nothing else helps.</p>
<p>Crony capitalism sits on the chest of the American economy, suffocating growth. Until will corral crony capitalism, our solutions will fail.</p>
<p>And government-first thinking has shocked our constitutional, limited government system, almost beyond recognition. But our solutions will be wasted on a patient who's bleeding, not breathing, or dead.</p>
<p><strong>If your priority is anything but blowing up that smirking political class</strong>, then you're going to kill the patient. He'll bleed to death.</p>
<p><strong>If you tolerate crony capitalism</strong>, then you're going to kill the patient. He'll suffocate.</p>
<p><strong>The only way to save the patient</strong> is to stop the bleeding by blowing up the political class, start the breathing by destroying crony capitalism, and then start the breathing of limited government.</p>
<p>All four Republican candidates say they'll treat for shock, but three of the candidates would be performing mouth-to-mouth on a corpse. <strong>Only Eric Greitens will follow the proven, lifesaving method of field first aid.</strong></p>
<p>Without reservation or purpose of evasion, <strong>I wholeheartedly and proudly repeat my endorsement of Eric Greitens for governor of Missouri. And I ask you to join me in saving our country.&nbsp;</strong></p>
