<p>I am a medical examiner in Columbia Mo. I have been doing this for over 25 years.  The pressure of the Republican Party and especially Rex Sinquefield cannot be ignored in his death. As you know he called the newspaper at 9:41 am and died 7 minutes later. His wife tell different stories. I strong believe that his death is not an uncomplicated suicide. His last words "I just have to be dead" might suggest that his family (children) were threatened.  If interested please googl "The mysterious death of Thomas Schweich". If you send me your e-mail I will send you the second article which has not yet been published.  I do not believe that he could have been bullied to take his life, nor was his health the issue, since at the autopsy of which I obtained he did not have any Khron's disease nor was we taking drugs except for some prescribed THC derivative.<br />
