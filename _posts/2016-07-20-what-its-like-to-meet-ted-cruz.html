  content: Good Story. I too started as a Cruz supporter, and was until tonight. He
    was my first choice. I am crushed to see the real him tonight. No wonder people
    are so cynical.

  content: Ted Cruz, what a DISAPPOINTMENT!! Ted you LOST the campaign and showed
    you are a sore loser. I supported Ted Cruz until Trump became the presumptive
    nominee.  I am now supporting Donald Trump, who was my second choice, because
    I truly care about the direction this country is headed. At the first debate all
    the candidates, including Ted Cruz took an oath to support the nominee. Cruz supporters
    believe, &ldquo;principle before party voters.&rdquo; Here is the problem with
    that position, Cruz took an oath to support the nominee and then did not live
    up to that oath. Cruz did not endorse Trump, thus going against his WORD, which
    is an UNPRINCIPLED stance. It was a classless act and shows his word is meaningless.

  content: While Tucker Carlson and others were lamenting that Trump broke tradition
    by not vetting Cruz's speech, I was thinking "This is another example of Trump's
    respect for people by giving them free reign, enabling them to achieve their own
    success or failure."  And Cruz clearly failed, as he has so often in the Senate
    and during the primaries. OTOH, Newt came out and ad-libbed a brilliant repudiation
    of Cruz's self-serving advice to conservative voters.

  content: "Cruz is a terrible strategist. You might expect a lawyer of his stature
    to be be better at strategy, but I'm beginning to think that legal strategy is
    very different from real life strategy. This probably owes to law being a closed
    system with defined boundaries while life is an open system with infinite confounding
    variables. \n\nBut look at Cruz's strategic record:\n1. His shutdowns, which I
    initially supported, accomplished nothing, but they gave Democrats sanctimonious
    talking points. Most people blamed Republicans, and conservatives in Congress
    lost stature and influence.\n2. His Evangelical strategy was fundamentally flawed
    from the start and would have resulted in a massacre in November. If the key to
    the White House was to activate non-voting or casually voting Evangelicals, he
    would have swept the South. But Trump dominated the South.\n3. He played nice
    with Trump through Iowa hoping to pick up Trump's supporters after Donald faded.
    Cruz called Trump \"terrific,\" \"energizing,\" and said he \"speaks the truth.\"
    But if Trump hadn't faded by Iowa, why would anyone think he'd fade then? \n4.
    Cruz wrote off the Northeast, except for Maine. He even dissed New York values.
    I think that was an attempt to shore up his base, but his personal base never
    wavered.  A better approach would have been weakening Trump in Trump's own backyard.
    \n5. Cruz repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to honoring the pledge he signed
    to support the Republican nominee, including Donald Trump by name. These reaffirmations
    came after Trump's call for temporary ban on Muslim immigration. \n6. Cruz didn't
    just dis Trump at the RNC--he dissed everyone who voted for Trump. This morning
    he criticized Trump supporters while speaking to the Texas delegation. \n7. Cruz
    foolishly admitted that his refusal to endorse stems from personal animosity,
    not philosophical differences. He said, \"I still haven't gotten an apology.\"\n8.
    Cruz told the Texas delegation, \"I will not throw rocks at Donald.\" Two questions
    later, he threw rocks at Donald, saying, \"Can any of you imagine our nominee
    answering questions from ordinary people like I am?\" \n\nBeing philosophically
    right is not that same as being strategically effective. In war, you want to be
    on the side that wins, not that side that marches best. The Brits learned that
    during our Revolution. When it comes to strategy, Ted Cruz is Cornwallis and Trump
    is Francis Marion."

  content: Egomaniac?  Both of them, plus Hillary, Obama and most politicians are
    Ego...it's how they get there I guess.  To your point, if Cruz was more personable
    he probably would have won.  Politics is show for too many.  However, Trump is
    just petty and prone to be a bully in my opinion which doesn't sit well with me.  I
    don't think he is evil or the next Hitler but if he wins it's going to be a sh!t
    show because the left will push it and he'll eat up the attention.  If Hillary
    wins, it will be even worse.   I've been trying to be positive but the arc of
    recent history is downward.  It will take all of us to fight against the downward
    spiral with positive energy, but I fear I and most others don't have the strength
    to affect change.  Negative energy begets negative results.  Hold on.

  content: "They all have tremendous egos, of course. That's necessary for politics
    at that level. \n\nFrom what I've learned this week, though, Trump sounds like
    a guy who listens to a lot of people before he makes a decision. For instance,
    he listens to construction workers, not just architects. He listens to his kids,
    not just consultants. He listens to voters, which is why he was so well tuned
    to their angst and frustration. \n\nThere's a risk in choosing Trump, I agree.
    But there's also great opportunity. If Mike Pence influences him, if Donald Jr.
    and Eric influence him, I think we're going to be alright with President Trump.
    But if conservatives turn their back on him, others will rush in to influence
    President Trump. Or Hillary wins. \n\nOur best strategy is to use President Trump
    to advance our cause. That requires, of course, there is a Trump presidency."

  content: "And today Cruz proved himself Lyin' Ted again. \n\nAfter swearing that
    his non-endorsement was all about \"freedom and the Constitution,\" he admitted
    that he broke his oath to support solely because Trump insulted his wife and his
    father. This was just personal, not business. \n\nTed could have said that. He
    could have said, \"If I don't endorse Donald, I'll break my vow to my party and
    to my country. If I do endorse him, I'll break my vow to love, honor, and obey
    my wife. Because I made my vow to my wife first, and I hold that vow and relationship
    above all others, I will not endorse Mr. Trump. But I will eagerly vote for Trump
    and Pence on November 8, and I beg you to follow my example.\"\n\nThat would have
    brought the house down and made Cruz look like both a genius and a great man.
    As we learned, though, Cruz is neither."

    him, and let him speak. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/755972015249645568\n\nNow
    you could say he was magnanimous in letting Cruz move forward. I could buy that.
    \n\nYou could watch the speech. Look at Trump look like sour puss as if he had
    no clue what was happening and listen to the boos while Cruz is actually speaking
    about the Constitution. \n\nI get it Bill. Hillary is bad, scary! Roger that.
    It's like your in a mental pretzel convincing yourself you took the moral high
    ground. "

  content: 'It is called INTEGRITY! Ted Cruz pledged to endorse the nominee no matter
    who it was and then went against his pledge. Then took the stage and did not endorse
    Trump. And went out of his way when he used the phrase "vote your conscience"
    which was the mantra of the #NeverTrump Unbound rabble rousers, who were looking
    for a way to thwart the will of the people who voted for Trump in the primaries.
    I supported Cruz and championed him during the process up until the time Trump
    won and became the presumptive nominee. Cruz should have been the better man and
    honored his pledge and UNIFIED the party, but he did not. And today he doubled
    down on his non endorsement. That is why I posted the following immediately after
    his speech.'

  content: To you SILLY anti-Trumpers, You do know what the country will get if Killary
    is elected, don't you? I challenge you anti-Trumper's to go to his site, check
    on his positions and then make an argument that those positions are not Constitutional
    and Conservative. You would lose that argument because they are. Then you say
    you can't believe him, but I say you do not know that for sure. So, if you truly
    care about where this country is headed you should give trump that chance to make
    believers out of you. Again, the alternative would be disastrous for the country.

  content: "You're right. Trump did vet the speech and let Ted speak. \n\nI think
    Trump is amazingly perceptive. He knew that letting Cruz speak would destroy Cruz's
    credibility. So he gave Ted enough rope to hang himself. And Ted did.\n\nWith
    all of Cruz's education, he doesn't understand people. Trump does understand people
    like a great behavioral psychologist. \n\nCheck out these stories, also on Hennessy's

    This Instead?\nHow Donald Trump Destroyed Ted Cruz"
---
<p>In case you didn't hear, Donald Trump invited Ted Cruz to speak at the RNC in prime time with no expectation that Cruz would keep his word by endorsing Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz immediately accepted the prime time speaking spot.</p>
<p>In case you didn't hear, Donald Trump waived his right to review Senator Cruz's speech in advance, the first time that's happened in our lifetimes according to Tucker Carlson. Mr. Trump respects Senator Cruz enough to let the senator say whatever he wants.</p>
<p>How Senator Cruz handled the kindness shown him reminds me of the time I met Ted Cruz, one one one.</p>
<p>I met Ted Cruz in September 2015. We both came off the stage of an event at the same time. I stopped and said, "Senator Cruz, I'm Bill Hennessy. As a founder of the tea party movement, I want to thank you for fighting for our freedom."</p>
<p>I don't know what I expected of him. I've met presidents. I've met senators. I've met supreme court justices (before they were supreme court justices). I've met many members of Congress and lots of state legislators. I've met admirals and generals. Some of them were glib, some were sincere, but all were friendly. Especially the admirals and generals. <strong>All made me feel like they were happier to meet me than I was to meet them.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Here's what happened as I introduced myself to Ted Cruz.</p>
<p>First, as I spoke, Senator Cruz stretched his neck and took a deep breath without saying a word. He watched me with his chin up.</p>
<p>Then, I noticed that my right hand was hanging between us. He made no attempt to accept the handshake I was offering.</p>
<p>Next, Senator Cruz dropped his gaze slowly down my body to my feet, then slowly back up to my eyes. I felt like I was back in Navy boot camp in PR inspection. Then Senator Cruz slowly waved his right hand between us, right to left, signaling that my time was up, move on.</p>
<p>I'm lucky that I don't need a senator's approval to feel good about myself. Twenty years ago, Senator Cruz's cold dismissal might have crushed me. Not this time. I was actually amused.</p>
<p>For weeks I mulled the incident in my mind. I told very few people about it, and I didn't blog about it. I was not afraid that my story would affect the primaries. But it was a private moment, and I meant what I told him. I am truly grateful for his work in the Senate, even if his strategies usually fail.</p>
<p>But over time I came to understand what Senator Cruz told me about himself that night. He told me he's a small man.</p>
<p>I know enough about body language to know why Senator Cruz straightened and puffed his chest. Males of all mammal species stretch and inhale to appear larger. It's a dominance move. I am three or four inches taller than Senator Cruz. Maybe he was trying to match my height.</p>
<p>Before you read too much into that, most men do this subconsciously in situations where they perceive a threat to their status or safety. Some men feel threatened more easily than others. I have no idea what I did or said to trigger Senator Cruz's dominance stature. Maybe I sounded more threatening than I meant to. Maybe I startled him. Maybe Cruz practices looking tough in a mirror. I don't know. But I do know that most senators, most politicians, don't react this way to my presence. They use very subtle signs of dominance, like putting their hand on my elbow or standing too close, but that usually comes after a few pleasantries to break the ice.</p>
<p>Senator Cruz didn't want the ice broken. He made no attempt to win me over. Cool, I guess. Some politicians seem glib because they need to be liked. Senator Cruz&nbsp;has no desire to be liked.</p>
<p>My experience may explain why Senator Cruz failed to click with evangelicals and many other conservatives he expected to dominate. Ted Cruz is cold. He lacks warmth. And studies show that people judge warmth even more critically than competence.</p>
<p>If you are a&nbsp;regular reader, you know that between September 2015 and February 2016,&nbsp;my feelings about Donald Trump turned. My feelings about Ted Cruz turned, too. Maybe my growing dislike of Senator Cruz resulted from my experience with him. Probably his rudeness affected me. His dismissive rudeness motivated me to look very critically at the Senator. And the more I looked, the less I liked.</p>
<p>As you know, I analyzed Senator Cruz's campaign strategy. My analysis showed that Cruz's strategy was flawed from the start. The details are <a href="http://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/">in my book</a>, so I won't waste words here. But by January I knew that Cruz was unlikely to win the nomination and had almost no&nbsp;chance of winning a&nbsp;general election. There just aren't enough true believers, and Senator Cruz lacks the warmth to win over casual voters. I question whether he even wants to win over others.</p>
<p>So why am I writing this now?</p>
<p>Because tonight Ted Cruz tried to emulate Ronald Reagan of 1976. Like most of the senator's political strategies, this one failed. And it failed because his ego got in the way as it always does.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of Reagan '76, Ted Cruz became Ted Kennedy '80.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>They say the measure of a man is how he treats people who can't do a thing for him. I can't do a thing for Ted Cruz, and&nbsp;he let me know it.</p>
<p>Tonight, Donald Trump gave Ted Cruz free reign of the RNC stage to say whatever he wanted, and Ted Cruz rudely dismissed Mr. Trump, just as Cruz rudely dismissed Bill Hennessy last September.</p>
<p>Now I ask: who's the egomaniac?</p>
