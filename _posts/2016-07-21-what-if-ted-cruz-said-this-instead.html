  content: Ted took the bait.  He was so setup.  Trump is an evil genius.  Unified
    the party in a chorus of boos.  Thank you for your service Ted.

  content: "I am confused. Ted called Mr. Trump a fraud, liar, serial philanderer
    and pathological liar. He constantly, lied about Mr. Trump at his rallies, telling
    his cult like audience, Mr. Trump was going to take their guns and not pro-life
    and keep Obamacare. Cruz and his wife knew these were blatant lies, yet continued
    to say it time and time again. Cruz was the one who started the attacks on Mrs.
    Trump, not the other way around. \nIt started when their friend Andrea McWilliams
    of Texas, appeared on FOX. She stated, Melania was not fit to be a First Lady
    because, \"she was a former model, married a divorced man and foreigner not born
    in America\". Mr. Trump never said a word about it, and Mr. Cruz never denounced
    her hateful and bigoted comments. \nThen, Cruz suggested he had no knowledge of
    Liz Mair's Pro-Cruz/Anti-Trump Super Pac, who ran a mean spirited and nasty ad
    using Mrs. Trump's picture pose from 18 years ago. It stated, Is this what you
    really want as your First Lady?  It was incredibly cruel. \nIt was then and only
    then, Mr. Trump tweeted- a picture is worth a thousand words. \nBoth men were
    wrong, but Ted Cruz needs to stop pretending this was one sided and claiming it
    started with Mr. Trump."

    Ted Cruz is simply delusional. Period. He has no grasp on reality, political or otherwise.

    If his political principles precluded him endorsing Trump, he should have said so. If personal principles were at stake, he should have said that. Standing on principle requires above all articulating said principles.

    No articulated principle in Ted Cruz' speech precluded an endorsement of Trump. Not a one. Indeed, the speech appeared to have been crafted to make the non-endorsement all the more conspicuous by framing its absence in a speech that arguably would have been a good wind up to that endorsement.

    So immediately the claim of standing on principle is seen to be false. Ted Cruz did NOT stand on principle, rather he stood on stagecraft. He employed rhetorical legerdemain to give a rousing speech about Constitutional principles while noticeably withholding the all-important endorsement of Trump. The calculation was that a few stolen news cycles now would position him well in 2020 for another run, presumably without Trump to muck up his plans.

    That's a political calculation. That's a gamble. It might even be a shrewd one (although I tend to doubt that), but what it is not is a stand on principle.

  content: '"nasty ad using Mrs. Trump''s picture pose from 18 years ago"  I do not
    think it was a nasty ad. Melania is BEAUTIFUL, but it was meant to be a cheapshot
    at her and Donald. So, Trump counter-punched. Ted blamed it on the Super-Pac and
    he has no control over what they do.(wink-wink)'

<p><em>Parts pulled from <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/07/21/how-donald-trump-destroyed-ted-cruz/">comments to this post</a>:</em></p>
<p>Today Cruz proved himself to be Lyin' Ted again.</p>
<p>After swearing that his non-endorsement was all about "freedom and the Constitution," he admitted today that he broke his oath of support solely because Trump insulted his wife and his father. For Ted, this was personal, not business.</p>
<p>Ted could have told us it was personal last night. But he lied instead. He could have said something else, too. And if I were his speechwriter, I'd have offered him something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Republican elephant in the room is looking at me, and you all know it. That elephant is asking, "will he endorse or won't he?"</p>
<p>Let me address that once and for all.</p>
<p>If I don't endorse Donald, I'll break my vow to my party and to my country, and I pride myself on keeping my word to voters.</p>
<p>But if I do endorse him, I'll feel in my heart that I'm breaking my vow to love, honor, cherish, and obey my wife. Because I made my vow to Heidi first, and because I hold that vow and her love above all other commitments, I will not endorse Mr. Trump tonight. But I will, by the grace of God, eagerly vote for Trump and Pence on November 8, and I beg every one you to follow my example.</p></blockquote>
<p>That would have brought the house down and made Cruz look like both a genius and a great man. As we learned, though, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/07/20/what-its-like-to-meet-ted-cruz/">Cruz is neither</a>.</p>
