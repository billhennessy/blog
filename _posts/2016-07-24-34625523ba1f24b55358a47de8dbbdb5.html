<p>I guess you can make anything you want to of a speech  if you don't like the person to begin with.  This, in my opinion, is how I saw your entire take on Mr. Cruz's speech.  I was disappointed to see the Tea Party endorse Donald Trump in the primaries, since after attending some of the rallies, thought you were a conservative group.     Even after researching Mr. Trump and then dropping him from 2 or 3 on my list of candidates to last, I was prepared to vote for him "for conscience sake"  until I saw him on Meet The Press today.  For him to say he would contribute to a super pac to defeat, Mr. Cruz in his run for senate has made me see his true character. Someone that vindictive certainly does not deserve the highest office in the land.  In light of that, I will not be voting for Mr. Trump in November.  As someone best said it, "The lesser of 2 evils is still evil"  I'm sure there is someone better to receive my vote<br />
