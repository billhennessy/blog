<p>After the DNCLeak stories, I think Bernie fans deserve a break.</p>
<p>Since you're probably looking for someone to vote for&mdash;someone who's anti-establishment and outside the political class&mdash;you might be thinking about Trump.</p>
<p>This might help: 25% off<a href="http://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/"> the ultimate guide to turning from anti-Trump to . . . voting for Trump.</a></p>
<p>I did it. You can, too. My book will help.</p>
<p>To get the 25% discount (that's like $2.50 in your pocket), just give me your email address and vouch that you Feel Berned. I'll email you the discount code and link.</p>
