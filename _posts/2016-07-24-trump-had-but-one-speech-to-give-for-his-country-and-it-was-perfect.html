  content: "I have long admired your work, Bill, as well as the level headedness you
    generally manage to keep. But this post reads like a very purposeful attempt at
    self-delusion in an effort to avoid confronting the harsh (and clear) reality
    that Trump does not care about you, me, or liberty--at all. \n\nThe mental gymnastics
    in this post are a sight to behold. Let's look at a few of them together: \n\n1.
    \"Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;I alone can fix it&rdquo; line wasn&rsquo;t an egomaniacal
    rhetorical flourish. Trump alone can fix it.\" Most Trump supporters I know--or
    at least the ones I respect--know to take Trump's rampant egomania in stride.
    \"He's earned it,\" they claim, or \"that's the confidence we need right now,\"
    they offer. But to pretend that he's not grossly narcissistic? To close-read his
    words like you're reading a novel, as if he doesn't just spout out whatever comes
    to mind without much thought? Trump told you who he is with his \"I alone can
    fix it\" line. You should listen. He's an egomaniac. He himself said he's never
    asked God for forgiveness, because he hasn't done anything that warrants God's
    grace. Does this sound like a grounded individual to you? Besides, no president
    can fix anything alone. He needs the cooperation of Congress, he needs to understand
    bureaucracy, he needs to work with a team in the White House. But this is the
    Trump show, and that's all his campaign has been since day one.\n\n2. \"Trump&rsquo;s
    speech was realism in an age of snowflake fakery, and the contrast makes you blink
    with shock. After two decades of hiding our trash, the garbage pails are overflowing
    into America&rsquo;s living room.\" What? Are you writing this from an alternate
    reality? This *isn't* an age of \"snowflake fakery\"--at all. The media sensationalizes
    every act of violence, every potential threat, and every natural disaster because
    they have to sell the news. The opposite of what you claim is going on is what
    is actually going on. The media incites panic constantly, and paints pictures
    of doom and gloom because they need viewers to tune in. The fact is that fewer
    lives are being lost in war than ever before in the recorded history of man, millions
    have been lifted out of extreme poverty across the world by the forces of capitalism,
    and crime in the United States is at a low. I'm not trying to gloss over the tragedies
    that do occur, and I'm not ignorant to the immense suffering in the world. But
    Trump isn't delivering a dose of reality, he's engaging in the same fear tactics
    the media engages in on the regular. This shouldn't surprise either of us: he's
    a media mogul, and he knows what will get people to keep listening. \n\n3. \"Donald
    Trump could be enjoying life at 70 as a billionaire. Instead, he&rsquo;s trying
    to fix what no one else bothered to fix.\" He *is* enjoying life at 70 as a billionaire.
    In fact, he's engaging in the most self-indulgent activity he has ever taken apart
    of, made possible by the fact that he *is* a billionaire: he's running for the
    presidency. He has all eyes on him, millions hanging on to his every word, and
    he's within reach of the most powerful seat of authority in the entire world.
    Do you really think he's sacrificing himself? Do you truly see him as a martyr?
    He's a hedonist, and he is loving every minute of the attention that is lavished
    on him daily. \n\n4. \"In 2012, he endorsed and supported Mitt Romney. Somehow
    Romney convinced Trump that the Romney-Ryan team would fix it. But they didn&rsquo;t.
    \ Romney couldn&rsquo;t even run an effective campaign.\" What's truly laughable
    about these lines is a bit more subtle, but it shows the depths of your delusion.
    When you say \"somehow Romney convinced Trump,\" you pitch it as if Trump was
    bamboozled by Mitt, or lied to, or nefariously deceived. As if Trump did not come
    to the conclusion on his own. Do you not see how this contradicts the image of
    Trump you peddle in your articles? We're supposed to believe he only supports
    winners, he has fantastic judgement, he will hire all the best people. So you
    skate over the clear evidence of a really important endorsement that reveals bad
    decision making, and frame it as if he was actually duped by Romney? Indeed, your
    willful ignorance has seeped into the grammar of your blog posts. Well done.\n\nI
    get it. You wrote a book about why Trump has to be The One, and now you have to
    see it through. But if he's The One, I want no part of your religion. I'm disappointed
    at your willful self-delusion, and I'm sad that someone who used to go against
    the grain is now closely following the narrative set forward by a corrupt elite."

<p>Now it makes so much sense. I don't know how I missed it. Trump's campaign is so perfectly consistent, it's almost scary. No, it is scary. It means we're down to our last hope.</p>
<h3>When I Turned On Trump</h3>
<p>I put this in my book, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/"><em>Turning On Trump</em></a>. I remember the night. I wrote late. Something hit me like wolves howling in the distance. Telling me something had changed. Or some ancient truth, long buried, had been uncovered. What I wrote on December 20, 2015:</p>
<blockquote><p>Donald Trump donated lots of money to the Clintons. He said nice things about Barack Obama. He promoted socialized medicine. He built his real estate business with crony capitalism. And Phyllis Schlafly is endorsing <em>him</em>?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t question Mrs. Schlafly&rsquo;s judgment. So I have to ponder the message.</p>
<p>Trump is the &ldquo;last hope for America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last hope. Last hope. Last hope.</p>
<p>The phrase ricochets around my brain like a ping pong ball shot into a Pringles can. &ldquo;Last hope.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Today I figured it all out. Things are really, really bad in America. Trump's "I alone can fix it" line wasn't an egomaniacal rhetorical flourish. Trump alone can fix it. You'll want to walk through this discovery with me. Follow closely, and it will be easy.</p>
<p>To put everything into context, we have to start with reactions to Trump's acceptance speech.</p>
<h3>Criticism of Trump's Speech</h3>
<p>Here are some of the words used to describe Trump's acceptance speech: dark, dystopian, desperate, angst-ridden, pessimistic, strong man.</p>
<p>It was all of those things, but it was much, much more. Trump described America and the world accurately. We are living in a dark, dystopian, desperate time, folks. Just look at the news. ISIS killed 80 people in Kabul on July 22, and it won't even be a headline. Public and corporate debt are at Depression-triggering levels. The central bankers have no idea what to do. Cops are targets for marauding&nbsp;gangs of race-motivated killers. Here's the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trumps-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-america/2016/07/22/0d508ca8-4ffe-11e6-aa14-e0c1087f7583_story.html">Dana Milbank's breakdown</a> of Trump's major themes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="U1100797431243y5F">&ldquo;Violence in our streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243f5B">&ldquo;Chaos in our communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243UpF">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243FO">&ldquo;One international humiliation after another.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243IgC">&ldquo;Forced to their knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243Z4G">&ldquo;Disasters unfolding.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243W8G">&ldquo;In ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243BwD">&ldquo;Helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243cXH">&ldquo;Worse than it has ever been.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243JzF">&ldquo;Poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243TiE">&ldquo;Ignored, neglected and abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U11007974312435AG">&ldquo;Communities crushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243QNH">&ldquo;Horrible and unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U11007974312430WD">&ldquo;Corruption has reached a level like never, ever before.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243wKD">&ldquo;Brutally executed.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243rUG">&ldquo;Men, women and children viciously mowed down.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243cS">&ldquo;Families ripped apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243taD">&ldquo;Damage and devastation.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243IiH">&ldquo;Such egregious crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="U1100797431243BfD">&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Trump concluded, &ldquo;is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump's speech was realism in an age of snowflake fakery, and the contrast makes you blink with shock. After two decades of hiding our trash, the garbage pails are overflowing into America's living room.</p>
<p>It's time to choose because we're down to our last hope as a nation and as a civilization. What began with the Renaissance will end with Hillary if anyone other than Donald Trump wins, even if it takes 200 years to see it.</p>
<p>And if things were not so bad, would Donald Trump would run as if his life depended on it? Billionaires five years past retirement age don't run for president for shits and giggles. As you read, you will see that Donald Trump is totally serious and totally consistent. Just read on and you'll see.</p>
<h3>1988 Foreshadowing</h3>
<p>In 1988, Donald Trump appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show. He was pumping his book, <em>The Art of the Deal,</em>&nbsp;but the conversation veered off into politics.</p>
<p>Trump explained that the only way he'd run for president is if America was down to its last hope&mdash;only if all other "leaders" had failed. Pay close attention to every word of this exchange between Trump and Oprah, set up by Eric Trump's remarkable RNC speech.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/99qn5BnC-es</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's so important, folks. Donald Trump said two things you must remember.</p>
<ol>
<li>I won't run for president unless things get so bad that no one else can fix them.</li>
<li>If I run, I'm running to win.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you thought Trump was mean and unfair to his primary opponents, remember those two things. No one else fixed the problems, and Trump plays to win. Always to win.</p>
<blockquote><p>If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what&rsquo;s happening with this country. We&rsquo;re really making other people live like kings, and we&rsquo;re not.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it. "If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it [running for president] out."</p>
<p>That was 1988. Ronald Reagan was president. Many Americans were convinced that Japanese firms would soon dominate America. <em>Back to the Future 2</em> predicted we'd be servants to Japanese masters. You might want to check out this <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/japans-eighties-america-buying-spree-2014-9?op=1">Business Insider </a>slide show<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/japans-eighties-america-buying-spree-2014-9?op=1"> about the era</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, Trump waved off talk of running for president himself. He trusted that political leaders would fix the problem before it got "so bad."</p>
<h3>What Happened Since</h3>
<p>It got so bad.</p>
<p>If you think Trump showed contempt and disdain for his opponents, it's because they let things "get so bad." Things are bad, and Hillary Clinton was at the center of making them so.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Trump is running like his life depends on it? Is it any wonder that his amazing kids are in this 100 percent? Is it any wonder that Phyllis Schlafly endorsed Trump, the only candidate with the balls to say, "we are down to our last election?"</p>
<p>Donald Trump could be enjoying life at 70 as a billionaire. Instead, he's trying to fix what <strong>no one else bothered to fix</strong>. What most politicians won't even admit. Hillary Clinton won't even say "Islamic terrorism." It's so bad that Donald Trump is willing to live out his remaining years restoring American greatness and preserving Western Civilization.</p>
<p><strong>But it's Trump's remarkable consistency that blows me away</strong>. He flirted with running for president in 2000 with the Reform Party and in 2012 as a Republican. He dropped out saying the professional politicians seemed like they knew what needed to be done. In 2012, he endorsed and supported Mitt Romney. Somehow Romney convinced Trump that the Romney-Ryan team would fix it.</p>
<p>But they didn't. &nbsp;Romney couldn't even run an effective campaign.</p>
<p>And the bad things in America and around the world got worse and worse. At some point, Trump figured, "it has to be me."</p>
<h3>It Had to Be Him, It Had to Be Now</h3>
<p>You might say Ted Cruz saw the same problems and could have fixed them. But Ted Cruz could not even energize Southern evangelical Christians enough to beat Trump. Cruz didn't want it as badly as Trump. And Cruz has absolutely no track record of accomplishments that Mr. Trump has. Winning a few legal cases is far different from turning a million dollar loan from your father in a $10 billion company.</p>
<p>Of all the people in politics today, Donald Trump is the only one who recognizes the desperate state our country is, has a history of doing the impossible, and shows the willingness to set aside the business he loves to fix the thing we all love more: the United States.</p>
<p>Now it all makes sense. Trump's run isn't some narcissistic pleasure cruise. It's a last-ditch effort to save the country that Donald Trump loves even more than the company he built.</p>
<p>Now you know the job must be done and only Trump can do it, you can do your part by reading <a href="http://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/">my new book</a>.</p>
