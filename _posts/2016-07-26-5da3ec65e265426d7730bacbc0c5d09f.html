<p>Mr. Hennessy - I consider myself a member of the St. Louis TEA party and enjoy all of your contributions.  Was just wondering if the St. Louis TEA Party Coalition was going to put out any sort of endorsement or recommendation of Missouri candidates who embrace our conservative and TEA party values?  Please keep up the good work.   Warm Regards   Bob<br />
