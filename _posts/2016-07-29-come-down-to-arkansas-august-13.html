<p>It's a great honor to be invited to speak at the Arkansas Tea Party Convention August 13 (details in a bit). It's a bigger honor that they've invited me back for a second consecutive year.<strong> I'd love to see familiar Missouri faces in the crowd.</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to talk about how we can be way more persuasive. Persuasion is what wins elections. Not facts. Persuasion. The more you know about persuasion, the more your side will win. It's that simple. That's why the left dominates the persuasion fields: advertising, movies, TV, journalism, education, psychology. Our side has pretty much abandoned those fields, haven't we?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So I'm going to talk about persuasion. When you walk out of the Doubletree Hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas, on August 13, you'll be armed with killer persuasion tools. You can use these tools to advance our cause, but you can also use them to get your kids to go to bed. They're that powerful.</p>
<p><strong>And I might have a very exciting surprise announcement. You won't want to miss that surprise because the balance of the Supreme Court could depend on it.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Here are all the details:</p>
