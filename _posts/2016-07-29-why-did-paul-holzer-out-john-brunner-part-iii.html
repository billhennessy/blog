<p><em>This is part III of a four-part series. Here's <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=20091">part</a><a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=20091"> I</a> and <a href="http://hennessysview.com/?p=20152">part II</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p><strong>Why did Holzer choose last week to out himself?</strong> Why show himself now, putting his old boss, John Brunner, in such a bad light? And right before the August 2 primary?</p>
<p><strong>Holzer has damaged Brunner's reputation and credibility.&nbsp;</strong>And Brunner spent a ton of his own money in the process, including paying $100,000 to the guy who made the video, then squealed about it.&nbsp;<strong>It almost looks like Paul Holzer meant to take out Brunner</strong>, does it not?</p>
<h3>Who Pushed Holzer to Show Himself?</h3>
<p>You, like me, probably don't believe Holzer did this on his own<strong>. Who told Holzer to show himself two weeks before the election?</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at all the major missteps in the Brunner campaign so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brunner's former campaign staffers, Eric McLean and Paul Holzer, set up a PAC that launched a fake EricGrietens.com website to smear Greitens, denying they received any compensation for the site.</li>
<li>Brunner consistently denied any connect to the fake smear site, even after the press reported the site's links to the Brunner campaign.</li>
<li>Brunner secretly recorded a phone call with Eric Greitens, a dirty trick that Jane Duecker and Mark Reardon of KMOX both called "sleazy."</li>
<li>Brunner then leaked that audio recording. &nbsp;(You'll want to read&nbsp;<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/11/29/fredo/">I Know It Was You, Fredo</a>.) Even sleazier.</li>
<li>Brunner pushed an anti-Greitens video released anonymously, again claiming to have no idea who made the video. We now know that Paul Holzer, Brunner's former chief of staff, made the video.</li>
<li>Now it looks like the Brunner camp took Paul Holzer on a media tour in Missouri, more or less admitting Brunner had been lying about connections to the video all along.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the&nbsp;casual observer, it seems Holzer's media tour was intended to take out Brunner, not Greitens.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>Here's my hypothesis.</p>
<p>Peter Kinder and Catherine Hanaway are both political insiders and known quantities. The Republican establishment in Missouri will always prefer the devil they know to the devil they don't know.</p>
<p>It's reasonable to assume that the establishment, in the form of Missouri's political consultants, used Brunner's money and campaign to hold Greitens down. They've done a good job getting a lot of conservatives freaked about Greitens' conversion to conservatism. In fact, the many lies and innuendoes about Greitens have driven a lot of conservatives to flat-out hate the guy. I never thought I'd see my friends from the Tea Party mocking and denigrating someone's military service, but that's exactly the depth a lot of them have sunk to.</p>
<p>When you look the polls, you find that all four candidates hover around 20 to 25 percent with Greitens holding a slight lead. Because of the animosity, Brunner's supporters feel toward Greitens, the party's consultants assume that disaffected Brunner supporters will defect to Hanaway or Kinder, but not to Greitens.</p>
<p>In other words, I think the Missouri political class used Brunner as a stooge, and now they're done with him. To ensure the GOP nominee is acceptable to the political class, they set Brunner up for a late fall. That political will probably work for Chris Koster in the general election just to keep their power. Koster's an elitist, too.</p>
<p>All this could happen without Hanaway's or Kinder's knowledge. Certainly, the operatives had to keep Brunner in the dark. <strong>I bet John Brunner was as surprised as anyone when Paul Holzer showed up for a series of interviews two weeks ago.</strong> Brunner is smart enough to know that exposing Holzer this late would destroy Brunner's credibility, not Greitens's because Brunner denied any connection to the video&nbsp;for months.</p>
<h3>Will Brunner Sing?</h3>
<p>John Brunner was pretty bitter and angry after that 2012 defeat. He told friends he'd never again fund his own campaign, and he'd never again work with a consultant. Those were, of course, empty promises. <strong>But if Brunner felt used after 2012, how do you think he'll feel this time?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>If I were a reporter,<strong> I'd stay very close to John Brunner on August 2.</strong></p>
<p>For the record, I endorsed Eric Greitens because I believe breaking up the state's political establishment is the most important thing for Missouri. I also think Greitens is the Republican candidate who can beat Chris Koster.</p>
