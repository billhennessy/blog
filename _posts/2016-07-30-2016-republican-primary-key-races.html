  content: 'Bill, I certainly agree with all of your choices except #5. I know Rick
    Stream.  He has a proven record in Missouri politics, a veteran and has integrity
    is above reproach.  Either one would be good, but this choice is a no-brainer
    for Senate District 15.  "At the end of the day" you must vote for Stream.'

  content: "I like Rick Stream. I agree with your character assessment completely.
    His record in the Missouri House, though, was less than stellar for a tea party
    type. He consistently voted party line, often voting for favoritism for GOP donors.
    That's crony capitalism, and it destroys innovation. \n\nAndrew Koenig, on the
    other hand, has a record as a fair arbiter over a level playing field. He doesn't
    do favors for the Missouri Chamber of Commerce. And Andrew will help Bill Eigel
    form a new Senate firewall. Stream will not. I guarantee it."

  content: "I sleep 9 to 5 every day ;-)\n\nThanks. I try to answer all my comments
    if they're thoughtful and shorter than my original post. I love getting comments.
    I learn a lot. \n\nLast week I learned that I sometimes go on the attack when
    the commenter was asking an honest question. I've also learned that I forget that
    everyone doesn't know the same things I know, and I don't know the same things
    they know. So I have to define some of my \"inside baseball\" political stuff.
    \n\nThank you, so much, for reading and commenting. You shouldn't be surprised
    that I responded. I should be surprised that you did."

  content: "Thanks! I appreciate it. \n\nBTW, I was at Eric Greitens's rally in Crestwood
    last night. He told us only 50 hours remained until the primary. Then he reminded
    everyone that SEAL training proved that you can work 50 hours straight. \n\nI
    learned the same thing on a submarine during the Cold War. You might not be at
    your peak after 50 hours, but you can be effective. \n\nI got a lot of sleep Friday
    night and last night. But there's a country to make great again. I can't do much,
    but I can do more awake than in my rack. \n\nWe're gonna do this, my friend."
