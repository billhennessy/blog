<p>From Dr. Ben Carson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>President Obama and his allies are trying to hijack the Republican primary in Missouri by attacking my good friend Eric Greitens.</b></span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Like me, Eric is a conservative outsider, and that means the political establishment is terrified of him. Obama and his allies are now spending a million dollars falsely attacking Eric Greitens and trying to fool the people of Missouri. </span><span class="s3"><b>Don't fall for it.</b></span><span class="s4"></p>
<p><a href="http://airmail.calendar/2016-08-02%2012:00:00%20CDT"><span class="s5">This Tuesday</span></a></span><span class="s1">, I hope you will send President Obama and every corrupt political insider and politician a message by voting for Eric Greitens. </span><span class="s3"><b>He's pro-life, pro-gun, and conservative to the core.</b></span><span class="s4"></p>
<p></span><span class="s1">Take it from me: there's a reason Eric is the only candidate in this race Barack Obama is afraid of. Don't let Barack Obama and the Democrats steal another election in Missouri.</span><span class="s4"></p>
<p></span><span class="s3"><b>I hope you'll join me in supporting my friend, Eric Greitens.</b></span><span class="s4"></p>
<p></span><span class="s1">Dr. Ben Carson</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3">Dr. Carson recognizes leaders when he sees them. I feel so good about his endorsement because it validates my complete faith in Eric Greitens for Governor.</p>
<p class="p3">The Democrats just tipped their hand and confirmed what I've been saying all along: Eric alone can beat Koster in November.</p>
<p class="p3">If you want four more years of a Democrat governor who vetoes every bill that worth the paper it's printed on, for for one of Eric's opponents. They'll let you down gently.</p>
<p class="p3">If you want to finally get your money's worth out of the Republican super majorities in the legislature, the only rational vote is Eric Grietens.</p>
