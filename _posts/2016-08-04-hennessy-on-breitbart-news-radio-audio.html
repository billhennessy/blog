<p>I was a guest of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM channel 125 yesterday. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/08/03/tea-party-leader-hennessy-you-cant-be-never-trump-and-never-hillary/">Dan Riehl wrote this very nice story about my appearance</a> on Breitbart News:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Tea Party activist Bill&nbsp;Hennessy chronicled his transition from Donald Trump opposition to Trump supporter in the&nbsp;book&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turning-Trump-Evolution-William-Hennessy/dp/1533313598" target="_blank">Turning on Trump</a></em>&nbsp;and shared some of his insights with<em>Breitbart News Daily</em> SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon Wednesday.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I started off very anti-Trump,&rdquo; said Hennessy, &ldquo;and over the course of the primary season, I did a complete one-eighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hennessy called the so-called Never Trump movement &ldquo;silly,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really be Never Trump and Never Hillary. One of the two will be the next President of the United States.&rdquo; Hennessy sees Trump as the more anti-establishment and conservative choice.</p>
<p>Concluded Hennessy, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to play this cutesy game&ndash;I&rsquo;m being true to some principles that allows me to do things that throw the election to Hillary Clinton&ndash;you&rsquo;re going to bear responsibility for what she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Dan.</p>
