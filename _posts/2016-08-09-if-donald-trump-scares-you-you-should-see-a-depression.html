<p class="p1"><span class="s1">America&rsquo;s fiscal year is <a href="http://airmail.calendar/2016-08-09%2007:32:06%20CDT"><span class="s2">October 1 to September 30.</span></a>&nbsp; With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs.&nbsp; (That&rsquo;s $381 Billion)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm"><span class="s2">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The average interest rate was just over <b>2%</b>.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm"><span class="s4">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">It is expected that the last two month&rsquo;s of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion.&nbsp; The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">In FY11, the Treasury paid creditors a record $454,393,280,417.03.&nbsp; (That&rsquo;s $454 Billion)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">With the debt at $19.4 Trillion (that&rsquo;s 19,400 billions of dollars) what do you suppose the interest costs to the Treasury will be when the annual interest rate returns to normal?&nbsp; (Normal would be 4% to 6%)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">In fiscal year 2015, the federal budget was $3.8 trillion.&nbsp; Of that amount only $1.11 Trillion was spent on what budgeters call discretionary items; food and agriculture, transportation, social security &amp; unemployment &amp; labor, science, energy &amp; environment, international affairs, housing &amp; community, veteran&rsquo;s benefits, Medicare &amp; health, education, government, and military.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">The other $2.69 Trillion was spent on interest and what budgeters call mandatory items; spending on programs that are required by existing law.&nbsp; Medicare and Social Security are the two largest mandatory spending programs.&nbsp; They are about 40 percent of the federal budget.&nbsp; Agriculture, Defense, Education, and Veterans Affairs, also require mandatory spending.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">As interest costs increase, either discretionary spending decreases or the annual deficit increases.&nbsp; Mandatory spending is unaffected unless Congress changes the law.&nbsp; Those mandatory checks always go out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">So, when interest goes from $426 Billion per year to $600 Billion per year, $174 Billion in programs that serve you and your neighbors must be cut.&nbsp; Or, Congress can increase the money supply to continue paying for the programs, which, as you would expect, will lower the purchasing power of your paycheck.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">Of course, we could vote in new leadership and change the trajectory of government expenditures.&nbsp; But, for most of you, that&rsquo;s way too scary.&nbsp;</span></p>
