<p>We're having a Tea Party.</p>
<p>It's time. Everybody's onboard. Now, we need you at the<strong> Tea Party for Trump, Sunday, August 28 at 4;00 p.m. at Surdyke Harley Davidson in Festus, MO</strong>. (Hey, hey, hey&mdash;it's only 20 minutes from South County.) &nbsp;And the band is getting back together (mostly). Expect <strong>many simultaneous Tea Party for Trump events across the country.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>FREE TICKETS ARE LIMITED. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tea-party-for-trump-rally-tickets-2832864173?utm-medium=discovery&amp;utm-campaign=social&amp;utm-content=attendeeshare&amp;aff=escb&amp;utm-source=cp&amp;utm-term=listing">GET YOUR FREE TICKETS NOW</a></p>
<p><strong>Ed Martin</strong>, <strong>Michelle Moore,</strong> <strong>Dr. Gina Loudon</strong>, and the <strong>world famous Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft</strong>, are founding members of the<strong> nationwide<a href="https://teapartyfortrump.org"> Tea Party for Trump</a>.</strong> And I am one of <a href="https://teapartyfortrump.org">Tea Party for Trump's</a> national spokespersons. (I know, but they couldn't afford union rates.)</p>
<p>We are committed to raising<strong> ground troops to knock doors and make calls in key battleground states</strong> like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and wherever we can make a difference.</p>
<p>(The South County Republican Club Picnic, originally scheduled for the same time, has been postponed. Again, I apologize for stepping on that event.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tea-party-for-trump-rally-tickets-2832864173?utm-medium=discovery&amp;utm-campaign=social&amp;utm-content=attendeeshare&amp;aff=escb&amp;utm-source=cp&amp;utm-term=listing">GET YOUR FREE TICKETS NOW</a></p>
<p>The Festus Tea Party for Trump will <strong>energize support in the St. Louis area</strong>. But we need <strong>volunteers</strong> at the event. If you can help, please <strong>fill out the brief form below</strong>. We will get in touch.</p>
<p>This is coming together fast, so accept my apology if I left something out. It's going to be okay. We will not let Hillary Clinton pick Antonin Scalia's replacement. We will not let Crooked Hillary eliminate the Hyde Amendment. &nbsp;And we will not debate anyone about the merits of the Republican nominee.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are the people who powered the Republican takeover of the <strong>House of Representatives in 2010</strong>.</li>
<li>We are the people who propelled Republicans to take over the <strong>Senate in 2014</strong>.</li>
<li>We are here to take the <strong>White House in 2016</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's as simple as that. Check out the <a href="http://teapartyfortrump.org/#team">Tea Party for Trump Founding Members board</a>. It's a who's who of original Tea Party organizers from February 2009. In addition to our St. Louis all-starts, there's Michael Patrick Leahy, Christina Botteri, Lloyd Markus, Eric Olsen, Tom Zawistowski, and more.</p>

<p>On a recent conference call, a senior executive with the NRA said, "I've worked alongside the Tea Party, and I've worked against the Tea Party. I can tell you, I don't have any desire work against you folks again.</p>
<p>And that's from one of our friends! Imagine how the other side must feel.</p>
<p><strong>We're gonna do this, folks. We're gonna do this.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>And we're going to start with this call for volunteers to help at the <strong>Tea Party for Trump at Surdyke Harley on August 28 at 4:00 p.m</strong>. No excuses.</p>
