<h3>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h3>
<h1>St. Louis Area Tea Party for Trump August 28 at 4:00 at Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus</h1>
<h2>St. Louis Tea Party Co-founders Reunite to Take White House</h2>
<p><em>St. Louis, MO, August 16, 2016:</em> &nbsp;Four St. Louis area Tea Party leaders who launched the local tea party movement announced a Tea Party for Trump Rally scheduled for 4:00 p.m. Sunday, August 28, 2016, at Surdyke Harley-Davidson, 2435 Highway 67 South in Festus, Missouri.</p>
<p>Ed Martin Jr., Michelle Moore, Bill Hennessy, and <strong>the world famous Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft</strong>&mdash;all original St. Louis Tea Party co-founders&mdash;have joined the nationwide <a href="https://teapartyfortrump.org">Tea Party for Trump</a> team along with Dr. Gina Loudon and John Loudon. The Festus rally will kick off St. Louis area tea party activities to provide grassroots support for Donald Trump in key battleground states and their home states. Among confirmed speakers is <strong>Jamie Allman of the number one morning radio show in St. Louis</strong> Allman in the Morning on KFTK 97.1 FM and The Allman Report on ABC KDNL 30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preventing Hillary Clinton from choosing Antonin Scalia&rsquo;s replacement on the Supreme Court should be all the motivation any Tea Partier needs to work hard for Donald Trump,&rdquo; said Hennessy. &ldquo;This is a no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked about the location of the event, Hennessy said, &ldquo;Tim Surdyke is a dedicated patriot, and Jefferson County is a perfect location for a Trump rally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like past tea party rallies, plans for the Tea Party for Trump on August 28 include a roster of local activist speakers, music, and sign-ups for volunteers. Organizers will contact Tea Party leaders across Missouri and southern Illinois to fill out the roster of speakers. The group has also contacted recording artist Kid Rock with a quirky pitch to entice the hip-hop and rock star to speak or perform at the rally. (Kid Rock has not yet responded.)</p>
<p>Tea Party for Trump&rsquo;s goal is to provide the teams for phone banks and door-to-door operations. The project will work with other organizations and their strategies in each state.</p>
<p>Tea Party for Trump will begin with Ohio, a state ripe for Trump's picking, and add additional battleground states as funding and time permit.</p>
