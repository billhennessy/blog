  content: Reading the FBI Summary of their interview with Killary Clinton points
    out that she is not fit nor qualified to be president. She cannot recall why she
    did anything and does not know why she had the private servers at her residences.
    She also does not know about classified information even though as Secretary of
    State she would have had the highest security clearance and she admits to being
    aware that she had that authority called the Original Classification Authority
    (OCA). She said she was briefed on Special Access Program (SAP), but she did not
    know how to handle that HIGHLY CLASSIFIED (only certain people with highest clearance)
    information. Meaning she would be a threat to National Security and thus should
    be disqualified from running for office. These new revelations are further proof
    that Killary Clinton committed perjury and should be indicted by the Justice Department
    for her crime, but don't hold your breath with this unjust Justice Department.
    Also, this interview was a retake of her interview when the Clintons were in the
    White House, where she could not remember anything.

<p>The FBI dumped its Clinton criminal investigation report today, and it's full of bombshells. Bombs are exploding like the 4th of July, especially the way Clinton lied about Gen. Colin Powell.</p>
<p>Clinton has maintained that Powell advised her to use a private email and cell phone instead of using secure systems provided by the US government.</p>
<p>Hillary lied.</p>
<p>Here's what the FBI found:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinton contacted former Secretary of State Colin Powell via e-mail to inquire about his use of a BlackBerry while he was Secretary of State . . . . In his e-mail reply,<strong> Powell warned Clinton that if it became "public" that Clinton had used a BlackBerry, and she used it to "do business," her e-mails could become "official record[s] and subject to the law."</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Remarkable.<strong> Hillary lied again and again.</strong></p>
<p>Sickly Hillary admitted to severe memory loss due to "head trauma."</p>
<p>Crooked Hillary admitted to losing numerous cell phones containing highly classified information.</p>
<p>Crooked Hillary denied any knowledge of security briefings or instructions.</p>
<p>It's clear that the people who wrote the FBI report thought Hillary would be indicted. They were stabbed in the back by the Obama administration in its attempt to keep Hillary out of the prison cell she earned.</p>
