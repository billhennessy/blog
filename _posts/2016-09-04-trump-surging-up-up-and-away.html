<p>Politico announced Tuesday: <strong>Clinton's Advisors Tell Her to Prep for a Landslide</strong></p>
<p>Inquisitor said the same day: <strong>Hillary Clinton Campaign Preparing for a Landslide</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-20639" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0795.PNG.png" alt="IMG_0795.PNG" width="327" height="583" /><br />
The stories beneath those headlines spoke of the intense hubris inside the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign. Their "experts" declared the race over on Tuesday. Assured of a landslide, Clinton stopped campaigning and turned to what the Clinton's do best: extorting money from the ultra-rich.</p>
<p>(Politico toned down its exuberant headline after Trump's triumph in Mexico City.)</p>
<p>You have to wonder if Hillary's minions are still popping champagne.</p>
<p>Two major polls, the LA Times and <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/trump-leads-hillary-clinton-3-points-latest-revelations-corruption-lies/">Reuters</a>, now show Trump surging up, up, and away from her crookedness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump's remarkable surge follows the best week by a Presidential candidate in living memory.</li>
<li>alongside Mexican President Enrique Pe&ntilde;aNieto on Wednesday</li>
<li>Trump gave the most detailed policy speech by any candidate so far this election cycle on Wednesday evening</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/video-donald-trump-receives-standing-ovation-detroit-great-faith-ministries-church/">Trump received a standing ovation</a> from the congregation of a black church in Detroit on Saturday</li>
<li>Trump hosted numerous rallies for ordinary folk in between</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, weak and crooked Hilary convalesced at her mansion and made a few trips out to take money from celebrity millionaires like a No&euml;l Coward character. Hillary dodged indictment by the FBI, again, after a holiday weekend document dump of portions of the FBI report on Hillary's unindicted crimes against national security.</p>
<p>Another week of contrasts this stark, and people will be saying <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/09/03/just-pretend-for-a-moment/">Trump is effectively running unopposed</a>.</p>
