<p><strong>UPDATE: The <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/breaking-donald-trump-attend-phyllis-schlafly-funeral-express-condolences/">Gateway Pundit has confirmed Donald Trump will attend Phyllis Schlafly's funeral</a> in St. Louis.</strong></p>
<p>If you're glad Ronald Reagan was once President, you should thank Phyllis Schlafly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mrs. Schlafly passed away, so you can't thank her personally. But you can celebrate her life and her swift entrance to heaven.</p>
<p><strong>This Saturday at 2:00pm, the ones she left behind will gather at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis (New Cathedral), 4431 Lindell Blvd. St. Louis, MO 63108, for her funeral mass.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Even the huge and ornate Cathedral seems too small and plain to celebrate Phyllis's life properly. The GOP convention seemed a better fit. She was there, of course, cheering on Donald Trump as she had since last December.</p>
<p>As I wrote <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2015/12/20/its-time-to-choose/">here</a> and <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/09/05/phyllis-schlafly-rip/">here</a>, Phyllis's support for Trump was instrumental in turning me. Who knows&mdash;maybe the Donald will pop by the Cathedral to pay his last respects. He owes her so much, really. She lent him legitimacy with the conservative base.</p>
<p>If you can't make the mass, you might want to <a href="http://amzn.to/2c3zrKf">read her last book</a>, co-authored with my friend Ed Martin. It's wonderful.&nbsp;<em><a href="http://amzn.to/2c3zrKf">The Conservative Case for Trump</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>
