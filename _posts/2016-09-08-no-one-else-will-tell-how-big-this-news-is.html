<p>&mdash; American Beauty, 1999</p></blockquote>
<p>As you watched Donald Trump destroy Hillary Clinton on NBC's Commander in Chief forum, something big happened.</p>
<p>And you didn't even know it.</p>
<p>A woman who lives her life advancing conservatism, fighting cronyism, and promoting the best of the Republican Party won the chairmanship of Missouri's 2nd Congressional District Republican committee.</p>
<p><strong>Renee Artman personifies the happy warrior of the right</strong>. She makes sure Republican Lincoln-Reagan Day events work just right. She organizes meetings so people can learn what's really going on in government and in campaigns. She recruits great candidates for office.</p>
<p>And she does all this almost no public recognition.</p>
<p>It's time to change all that.</p>
<p>Renee, who's <strong>never shy about holding Republican office holders accountable</strong> to their core principles, is now <strong>the most powerful woman in the 2nd Congressional District in Missouri.</strong></p>
<p>You might be thinking, "what about Ann Wagner?" Sure, Ms. Wagner's in the US House leadership and she's a friend to the cronyest cronies in America, but <strong>political parties run on the people who show up and work</strong>. Renee's now in charge of those people in Ann's district. It's like that scene from American Beauty when Kevin Spacey tells Annette Benning, "Well, actually, Janine is Senior Drive-thru Manager so you are on her turf."</p>
<p><strong>The Republican establishment is now on Renee's turf.</strong> Me, too, since I live in the 2nd District.</p>
<p>And all our property values just went up.</p>
<p>And, speaking of people who show up and work, I hear that Jen Bird's efforts made a big difference in Renee's landslide.</p>
<p>We owe both of these ladies a big thanks.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Renee. It's a win for the people.</p>
