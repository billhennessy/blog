  content: "More Morons on MSNBC, Morons Speaking Nothing But Crap, acting as a propaganda
    arm of the DemonRATS and the Killary Campaign making excuses for Killary Clinton,
    claiming there is nothing wrong with her health. She was just overheated. Anyone
    watching the video knows it was/is more than that. She was completely out and
    had to be dragged into the van. Also, this is not the first time she had to have
    assistance being held up and walking. So, what are the excuses for those incidents?
    Recurring pneumonia? More heat exhaustion? Then again siding with Killary is to
    be expected especially when the email dump during the DNC convention showed the
    so-called Mainstream Media is in collusion with the DemonRATS and the Killary
    campaign to steal the election. \nIn New York 40 minutes before the video showing
    Killary collapsing and being dragged into the van it was 79 degrees, 54% humidity
    and dropping, with a 9 mph wind."

<p>Earlier I said <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/09/11/suddenly-you-feel-sorry-for-hillary/">the press has covered up Hillary Clinton's horrible health problems</a>. The press (or media as some call it) now admit as much. But they're trying to weasel out of their culpability. See this line from an otherwise sound article on <a href="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/politics-ideas/campaigns-elections/a-conspiracy-theory-no-longer-health-hillary-clinton/">Commentary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;While <strong>most serious people dismissed the rumors</strong> <strong>about Clinton&rsquo;s health</strong> that were being circulated by Donald Trump&rsquo;s supporters, what happened Sunday morning will deepen suspicions both about her health and whether her campaign has been telling the truth about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The thing is, Hillary's 9/11 seizure or collapse or fainting spell is <strong>NOT an isolated incident</strong>. Her collapse into the van wasn't a one-off. <strong>Hillary stumbles, passes out, faints, falls, collapses All. The. Time!</strong> She coughs All. The. Time! We were not imagining this.</p>
<p><strong>The "serious people" were wrong</strong> all along. Even if you were one of them.</p>
<p>You call people who point out Hillary's obvious health problems "conspiracy theorists." WRONG! We're just pointing out the obvious.</p>
<p>Look, I know about confirmation bias. Your brains told you that only fit, healthy people run for president. <strong>So your brains blocked out images that contradicted your bias</strong>. If candidates are sound and steady, then the images that show Hillary as weak and sickly must be wrong. Must be doctored.</p>
<p><strong>But that was just your brain lying to you</strong>. And your brain got a lot of help from the press.</p>
<p>Hillary is sick, and winning in November would probably make her even sicker. She is not physically fit to stand up to Putin and Black Lives Matter and China and North Korea. Hell, she can't even stand up long enough for the car door to open.</p>
<p><strong>Stop calling everything you don't want to be true a "conspiracy theory."</strong> And start doubting everything you believe to be true. Because truth is nothing more than what you believe at the moment.</p>
