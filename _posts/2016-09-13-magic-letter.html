<p>Just pretend that this letter is sort of magic. You don&rsquo;t have to be aware of how it&rsquo;s magic. Just pretend that you&rsquo;re reading a magic letter. In a moment you'll find out how it works.</p>
<p>You might find yourself rolling your eyes and thinking you&rsquo;re too old and too smart for magic letters, but the more you read, the more you might wish this letter really is magic.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still reading, you might even laugh a little at how stupid this sounds. You don&rsquo;t have to believe in magic to pretend you&rsquo;re reading a magic letter, though, do you? If you want to pretend you can. No one can stop you.</p>
<p>If this really were a magic letter it would grant your wishes, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Like a genie in a bottle. You&rsquo;d read the letter and your wishes would come true. You can pretend, anyway, just for a little while.</p>
<p>A real magic letter would probably tell you to close your eyes and make three wishes. But this is a different kind of magic letter. This magic letter gives you only one wish, and it has to be a wish for someone else. Its magic won&rsquo;t work for you. It&rsquo;s a kind of karma magic, not genie magic.</p>
<p>Still, magic&rsquo;s kind of neat, and you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to waste a wish, even if the wish is for someone else. Why not make somebody else&rsquo;s day, right?</p>
<p>One other thing: the wish has to be something that actually helps that person or makes them happy somehow. Wishing ill on someone won&rsquo;t do any good.</p>
<p>If this were a real magic letter, here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;d activate the magic powers:</p>
<ol>
<li>You&rsquo;d have to&nbsp;say the name of the person you&rsquo;re wishing for out loud. At least whisper.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;d have to close your eyes and picture that person in your mind. Right in front of you.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;d have to speak your wish for them out loud.</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing, too. You have to repeat those three steps every day for three days.</p>
<p>If this were really a magic letter, the wish would eventually come true, would it not? You can test it and see. You make a wish and start to feel better about that person, too.</p>
<p>And even if this letter isn&rsquo;t magic in that way, you&rsquo;ve made a wish for someone. It took you only a few seconds total, and you did something nice for someone even if they never know about it. You should feel good about yourself.</p>
<p>What if there was even better news?</p>
<p>If you get a magic letter, you can bet other people get them, too. And if enough people get these magic letters, someone&rsquo;s bound to make a wish for you. Someone somewhere will say your name, close their eyes, imagine your face in their mind, and make a wish that something great happens for you.</p>
<p>The more people get these letters, the more likely someone&rsquo;s wishing good for you. Someone could be making a wish for you right now. And if someone's wishing good for you, you might have a great day tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking there&rsquo;s another catch. In a movie, you know that catch would go something like this: the other person&rsquo;s wish for you won&rsquo;t come true unless you&rsquo;ve made a wish for somebody else.</p>
<p>This letter didn&rsquo;t say anything about that, though. Maybe it&rsquo;s true. You&rsquo;re free to believe either way.</p>
<p>When you get to this part of the letter, you might start to feel good about the positive changes you&rsquo;ve already made in our life. That&rsquo;s a kind of magic, too, isn&rsquo;t it. You don't have to believe in magic for the magic to work on you, do you?</p>
<p>Congratulations for reading this far. You&rsquo;re on your way to something good happening. Not all good, maybe, but some good. It's just the way magic letters work.</p>
