<p>If you thought the government never made a mistake, this story might surprise (via <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/19/feds-mistakenly-grant-citizenship-800-immigrants/">Breitbart</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (AP) &mdash; The <strong>U.S. government has mistakenly granted citizenship to at least 858 immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security</strong> or with high rates of immigration fraud, according to an internal Homeland Security audit released Monday.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Department&rsquo;s inspector general found that the immigrants used different names or birthdates to apply for citizenship with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and such discrepancies weren&rsquo;t caught because <strong>their fingerprints were missing from government databases</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or maybe it wasn't a mistake. Is it possible that the Obama Administration or miscreants in the government "disappeared" those fingerprint records? It's worth pondering, people. It's worth pondering.</p>
<p>Obama and Hillary are campaigning for open borders and huge floods of immigrants from places like Somalia and Syria. After each Islamic terrorist attack, Obama and <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/07/22/hillary-wants-americans-to-suffer-european-style-terrorism/">Hillary rebuke the victims </a>and demand <em>even more</em> immigration from countries with terrorism problems.</p>
<p>Further, the <strong>FBI and the Justice Department clearly took steps to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution</strong> for the crimes she certainly committed as Secretary of State. For example, they redacted incriminating information from unclassified documents released to Congres. The FBI, DOJ, and State Department have routinely violated court orders.</p>
<p>If our chief law enforcement officers routinely&nbsp;break the law, how can you trust any government agency? It seems to me <strong>all government officials and employees are tainted</strong>. Every last one of them. &nbsp;I'm not saying they're all criminals. I'm saying the government is so corrupt it's impossible to sort out the crooks from the decent people.</p>
<p>The New York/New Jersey bomber&nbsp;Ahmad Khan Rahami&nbsp;should have been on the terror watch list. He wasn't. But <strong>his own father reported Rahami to the FBI as a terrorist years ago</strong>. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/21/known-wolves-several-terrorists-were-under-investigation-before-attacked.html">The FBI told his dad, "Nope. He's a good guy."</a> So the father believed them.</p>
<p>Is the FBI that corrupt or that incompetent?</p>
<p>Rahami&nbsp;traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan at least three times after immigrating to the United States. One of those trips lasted nearly a year, and his official destination was the hometown of Taliban headquarters.</p>
<p>But the FBI gave the all-clear to this <em>summa cum laude</em> valedictorian of Radicalization University.</p>
<p>Maybe the FBI was too busy obstructing justice in the Clinton case.</p>
<p>As your kids board that bus in the morning, remember this: our government is more concerned with covering up Hillary's felonies and shielding terrorists from deportation or prosecution than in making sure your kids get home alive.</p>
<p>Who are you going to vote for?</p>
