<p>I talked with the Trump Headquarters in Fenton, MO.  They suggested I contact Bill Hennessy. I was told Mr. Hennessy is putting together a large group of administrative type people. I am interested in the group you are putting together to help the right people get into office. Trump Headquarters told me you are looking to put together a group of people regarding conservative principles.  I have always worked with large corporations, large ministries --anything involved in organizing projects combined with people.  My husband and I live in the Branson, MO area but would be willing to relocate. Could someone please contact me and I will be happy to send you a copy of my resume. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Pamela Tucker 417-561-1241.<br />
