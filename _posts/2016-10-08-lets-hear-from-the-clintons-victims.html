<p>Today, Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) abandoned her party's nominee to support a rape accomplice for President. <strong>Ann Wagner has lost her moral authority </strong>on<strong> all matters outside of her own home</strong>. I call on Mrs. Wagner to resign from the House of Representatives and to retire gracefully from public life.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wagner seems to believe that being a woman gives her some unique moral vantage point. She forgets that she's not the only woman in America.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/clinton-vs-trump-on-women/">click here to read my take on Trump's Access Hollywood remarks</a>.</b></p>
<p>The women who really have a unique moral vantage point on Trump and the Clintons are the many, many women Bill Clinton has raped, molested, and abused. <strong>These women were also abused, threatened, belittled, intimidated, and bullied by Mrs. Clinton.</strong></p>
<p>Here's what a few of these women have to say:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hillary calls Trump's remarks "horrific" while she lives with and protects a "Rapist". Her actions are horrific.</p>

<p>Those are some thoughts from Bill and Hillary Clinton's sexual abuse victims. Compared to their voices, Ann Wagner spews meaningless, selfish babble.</p>
<p>Finally, I see that Senator Roy Blunt is sticking with Trump. Good for Roy. I am glad I endorsed him.</p>
