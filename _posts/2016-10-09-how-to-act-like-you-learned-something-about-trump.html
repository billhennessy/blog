<p>People in the media and the GOP are acting like they learned something on Friday. That's when the Washington Post released <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/clinton-vs-trump-on-women/">an audio (later conjoined with video) of Donald Trump talking </a>lewd about his exploits with women.</p>
<p>I say media people and <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/lets-hear-from-the-clintons-victims/">Republicans are &nbsp;"acting" like they learned something</a>, because they didn't. We didn't. <strong>Everybody who's paid attention to the race (or pop culture) already knew how Trump is</strong>. Everybody knows Trump brags about his sexual prowess and how women melt around him. There's nothing new, but a few very emotional people who have trouble separating their feelings from their thoughts give into the impulse to&nbsp;<em>act</em> like they've learned something. No one's that ignorant.</p>
<p>But something bigger remains the same. <strong><a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/09/25/if-you-want-mike-lee-on-the-supreme-court-you-have-to-vote-for-roy-blunt/">Antonin Scalia is still dead</a>.</strong> The first significant act of the new Congress and the new administration will be to fill that empty seat on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>Scalia's seat will be filled by someone like Elena Kagan or someone like Mike Lee.</strong> The person who appoints that replacement will be someone who covers up her own crimes and her husband's rapes, or someone who brags about women desiring him because he's a wealthy star.</p>
<p>Again, nothing's changed.</p>
<p><strong>If you want a Supreme Court that rules like Elena Kagan, vote for Clinton. If you want a Supreme Court that thinks like Mike Lee, vote for Trump.</strong></p>
<p>You've learned nothing, so don't act like you have.</p>
