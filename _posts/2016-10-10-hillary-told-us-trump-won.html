  content: "Wise, I think in debate one. Trump was suffering from a sinus attack and
    was not the Donald.\nLast night, his A game was on. If it had not been for a biased
    moderator, he would have succeed in destroying her.\n\nNext time I want him to
    cover her beloved \"Arab Spring\" which has killed hundreds of thousands, destabilized
    the middle east, has the potential of bringing us to war with Russia or Iran...
    and many other consequences.\n\nI want him to revisit her \"supports the second
    amendment\" with a \"after you go to the new revised liberal dictionary to define
    the second amendment\". She no more supports the second amendment as Bill is sorry
    he sodomized Monica..\n\nI would ask her if she agrees with the six draconian
    gun laws that California passed now there is no way to get the Supreme Court to
    support the 2nd amendment with a tying number of liberals on the court. Ask her
    if she would push for those 6 laws to be national laws.\n\non the emails. \n1.
    She committed spoilation when she deleted the emails. \n2. She could never get
    a security clearance as a DOD employee as a result of her transmitting and receiving
    classified information on her personal mail server.\n3. As she has been read in
    over 100 times. She KNOWS or was not paying attention in the security briefings
    where she is told EVERYTHING on this or that topic IS considered classified until
    cleared by the security officer. Thus her statement that it was not marked classified
    is a red herring and NAIL her for it.\n4. If I were Trump, I would send a public
    letter to the major world security services, asking each of them for their copies
    of the 33,000 deleted emails. As certainly each one of them has complete copies
    of her mail server."

<p>I really want to go to bed, but my brain won't &nbsp;sleep until I type this out.</p>
<p><strong>Hillary Clinton told us Trump won the debate with her final answer</strong>. Final answer.</p>
<p>An audience member asked the closing question. He challenged the candidates to say something nice about their opponents. Hillary went first.</p>
<p><strong>The right way to answer those screwball questions is to say something nice and sit down</strong>. I'll explain why in a moment.</p>
<p>Hillary began by talking briefly about Donald Trump's great kids. She got that part right.</p>
<p>But then Hillary went on the attack about negative campaigning. She talked for over two minutes, beyond her allotted time. This time, though, I don't think Trump minded.</p>
<p>When Trump's turn came, he nailed it. He called his opponent "a fighter," and he piled on about her refusal to give up.</p>
<p>We all know Trump respects the hell out of fighters. His compliment was sincere as they get.</p>
<p>And then Trump sat down.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Here's why Hillary's answer was so bad and <strong>why she knew she lost.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When a voter asks a softball question, people want and expect a softball answer. We all wanted to feel good about something. We all know this race is nasty. <strong>We wanted a tiny respite from that nastiness. But Hillary just reminded us</strong>. She turned a softball question into an ugly answer. Because she had to try something.</p>
<p><strong>Trump knew he'd won</strong>. He didn't need to land a punch after the bell. He knew it, and he went to his corner. Like a champion. Like a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>Hillary knew she'd lost.</strong> She needed to try something to even the score, so she took a chance with a cheap shot after the bell, over the ref's shoulder. She was cheap and ugly. And her gambit failed.</p>
<p>B<strong>y hitting after the bell, Hillary told us all she lost</strong>. <strong>She telegraphed the outcome.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Trump is back on top. Watch him rise. <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/151599421561/quick-debate-reactions-from-switzerland">Greatest 3rd Act ever</a>.</p>
