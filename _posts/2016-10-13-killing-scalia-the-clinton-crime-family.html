    The following are two more of the Clinton body count:
    Barbara Wise
    Commerce Department Staffer
    died: 11/29/96 - As the scandals continued to swirl around the John Huang, one of Huang's associates, Barbara Wise, was found dead in her locked office on the fourth floor of the Department of Commerce, partially nude (by one report completely nude) and covered with bruises. No cause of death has ever been announced even though an autopsy was conducted (prior to next of kin being notified). Calls to the D.C. autopsist, Dr. Jaardemal have gotten an assurance that the bruises were not from being beaten but nothing else. Despite claims of ongoing illness, no record of a hospital visit in the months leading up to her death has surfaced. Oddly enough, following the discovery of her body, Bill Clinton made an unscheduled return to the White House from Camp David, claiming he needed a book of poetry in order to complete his inauguration speech.

    Unanswered Questions Haunt Family of Oklahoma City Bombing First Responder.
    By: Wendy S. Painting, October 2, 2009
    On May 11, 1996, the New York Times ran a story with the headline &ldquo;A Policeman Who Rescued 4 in Bombing Kills Himself.&rdquo; Sergeant Terrance Yeakey, Oklahoma City Police Department, was 30 years old and was about to receive the police department&rsquo;s Medal of Valor for his heroic rescue efforts the day of the Oklahoma City bombing, which occurred on April 19, 1995.
    Yeakey was the first to arrive on the scene that terrible day and saved the lives of countless people from the rubble of the building and the horrific effects of the explosion. The article says Yeakey committed suicide, claiming that he was living in emotional pain because he could not do more to help the people injured in the bombing, and that he was suffering from intense survivor guilt which he was unable to manage. But others in Oklahoma City, including the family of Terrance Yeakey, claim that his death was not a suicide at all, but a brutal murder, and indicate that local law enforcement were complicit in covering up this murder.
    On September 26, 2009 the Yeakey family spoke out for the first time on video for an interview with journalists from Radio Free Oklahoma and an American Studies PhD student from the University of Buffalo who is writing her dissertation on the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. What these researchers found was that the facts surrounding Yeakey&rsquo;s death are quite disturbing, and that the treatment of the Yeakey family in the aftermath of the death was beyond appalling.
    [Terry Yeakey and family. 1995]
    It is important to note how, exactly, Yeakey is supposed to have killed himself. He was said to have slit his wrists and neck, causing him to nearly bleed to death in his car, and then miraculously climbed over a barbed wire fence. He then was purported to have walked over a miles distance, through a nearby field, eventually shooting himself in the side of the head at an unusual angle. Startlingly, no weapon was found at the scene of the body, no investigation was conducted, no fingerprints taken, and no interviews with family members or friends were had to try and determine why Yeakey would have been suicidal, or if he had, in fact, been suicidal at all. Instead, the conclusion that Yeakey&rsquo;s death was a suicide was reached immediately, without an autopsy. Yeakey had witnessed things during his response to the bombing which did not agree with the &lsquo;official version&rsquo; of events touted by the national media and law enforcement at that time. Yeakey was in the process of collecting evidence which supported and documented the inconsistencies he witnessed the morning of the bombing at the scene itself.

<p>Do you think the Clinton Crime Family whacked Antonin Scalia? You will soon if you let yourself read this and all the links. But first, a strange call I had last week.</p>
<h3>Something Unrelated</h3>
<p>At the end of our talk, the reporter said, "do you mind if I ask you about something else? It has nothing to do with my article, and I won't write about it."</p>
<p>"Uh, sure," I said. I was a little apprehensive.</p>
<p>"Do you believe <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/10/02/killing-ron-brown/">the Clinton's killed Ron Brown</a>?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p><em>Here we go</em>, I thought.&nbsp;<em>I'm&nbsp;going to &nbsp;get called a conspiracy whack job</em>.</p>
<p>"I have no idea," I said. "I do know reporters who have looked into the case and no longer call the idea crazy. Even some skeptics trying to debunk the assassination story have come away uncertain. And I&rsquo;m sort of a libertarian. I really don't trust the government."</p>
<p>"I don't trust the Clintons," the reporter said. &ldquo;I covered them back in the early nineties in Arkansas. During the campaign in ninety-two. And in Washington some."</p>
<p>We talked a little more. The reporter knew Ron Brown and liked him. "He told you the truth." And she knows the Clintons. They are not like Ron Brown. The Clintons are mean people. And they lie to reporters. They lie to everybody.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/10/02/killing-ron-brown/">Read more about the assassination of Ron Brown here</a>]</p>
<h3>Conspiracy Theory</h3>
<p>I expected to be called a conspiracy theorist when I posted the Ron Brown story. Instead, I've received only worried acknowledgments that the Clintons are capable of anything, including assassination.</p>
<p>The reporter is a veteran, serious, established journalist. You'd know her name if I told you.&nbsp;Like all good reporters, she's skeptical and meticulous. She checks things out.</p>
<p>And like everyone who's checked into the Ron Brown assassination, she's not sure. She doesn't believe it was an accident, but she can't prove it wasn't.</p>
<h3>Scalia Wet Work</h3>
<p>Then today we learned that Hillary associates John Podesta and Steve Elmendorf&nbsp;exchanged<a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wikileaks-uncover-murder-plot-podesta-documents-suggest-scalia-assassination/"> emails that appeared to reference an assassination </a>the day before Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead with a pillow over his head at a remote lodge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20876 size-full" src="http://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-2016-10-13-20.16.39.png" alt="screenshot-2016-10-13-20-16-39" width="622" height="552" /></p>
<p>"Wet works"&nbsp;is spy-talk for "assassination."</p>
<p>Scalia died in a lodge owned by a well-connected Democrat. Alex Newman wrote in The New American, February 16, 2016:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suspicions and unanswered questions surrounding the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/22544-justice-antonin-scalia-found-dead-at-a-west-texas-ranch">surprise weekend death</a>&nbsp;of pro-Constitution U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia are swirling around the Internet and beyond. Many of the concerns center on the fact that the man who found Scalia's body, <strong>businessman and Democrat donor John Poindexter,</strong> said the late justice was discovered with &ldquo;a pillow over his head.&rdquo; Also sparking alarm among some commentators and suspicious citizens are reports and official statements indicating that no autopsy will be conducted, despite contradictory claims surrounding the cause of death. Even the establishment press, apparently unfamiliar with the definition of the term &ldquo;conspiracy theory,&rdquo; has started reporting on the concerns and questions, albeit generally with a dismissive tone. <strong>Cries for an autopsy and congressional probe are growing louder</strong>, too, even as the White House, Democrats, and leftists waste no time in plotting to name a successor and tip the balance of power. The atmosphere is getting very tense.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Suspicious Death</h3>
<p>You probably remember that a lot of suspicions surrounded Scalia's death.</p>
<ul>
<li>He showed no signs of health problems at dinner the night before</li>
<li>He went to be at 9:00 p.m.</li>
<li>According to Democrat John Poindexter, owner of the lodge where Scalia died, Scalia "refused" a security detail for the night</li>
<li>John Poindexter discovered Scalia's body the next morning</li>
<li>Scalia was dressed with a pillow over his head</li>
<li>Scalia's bed looked unused, as if he took a nap on top of the blankets</li>
<li>But he had a pillow over his head</li>
<li>And there was no autopsy</li>
</ul>
<p>The government refused to allow an autopsy on Ron Brown's body, too, after a US Marshall determined cause of death over the phone, via <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/22555-scalia-death-with-pillow-over-his-head-sparks-suspicion">The New American</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another top media personality asking questions was Michael Savage, among the top five most influential and most widely listened to talk-radio hosts in America. &ldquo;Was [Scalia] murdered?&rdquo; Savage asked during his program. &ldquo;We need a Warren Commission-like federal investigation.... This is serious business.&rdquo; He also called for an immediate autopsy, according to media reports. In a follow-up post on his website, Savage also wondered how the left would react if anti-U.S. Constitution zealot Ruth Bader Ginsburg died under similar circumstances with a pillow on her face in the final year of a Republican administration at a property owned by a mega-donor for the GOP.&nbsp;And in an interview with Savage on Tuesday, leading GOP presidential contender Donald Trump, when asked whether the candidate would support a Warren Commission-style probe, noted that "they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow.&rdquo; Trump did not say whether he would support a commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no medical examiner present. There was no one who declared the death who was there. It was done by telephone from a U.S. Marshal appointed by Obama himself,&rdquo; Savage said, outlining some of the many reasons why suspicion, whether warranted or not, is spreading like wildfire across America. &ldquo;The question is, is it a conspiracy theory to ask questions that are so obviously in need of answer, or is it just common sense. And where is the common sense both in the press and the Republican Party. The answer is nowhere.&rdquo; Of course, questions, by definition, cannot be a &ldquo;conspiracy theory, despite the establishment media's misuse of the term.</p></blockquote>
<p>It looked in February like Scalia was assassinated, and it looks now like Team Hillary conducted the murder. Why else would "wet work" make Hillary Dems "buckle up and double down?"</p>
<h3>The Clinton Body Count</h3>
<p>The more you read about the Clinton body count, the more you believe it's possible that the Clintons have ordered the assassinations of many, many people. Not just enemies, but people with information. People in the way.</p>
<p>Scalia was in the way. Now he's not.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but that conversation with a veteran reporter tells me the Clintons are capable of anything, including assassinations. And I think they could have killed Scalia.</p>
<p>P.S. If you're wondering what <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wikileaks-uncover-murder-plot-podesta-documents-suggest-scalia-assassination/">Vineyard they're referring to, see The Gateway Pundit</a>.</p>
