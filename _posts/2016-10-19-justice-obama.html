  content: "SO TRUE SO TRUE..  Vote on the issues not the person.\nHIllery lied in
    the last debate..she \"volunteered\" she \"supports the 2nd amendment\" .. she
    got an F from the NRA. What does that mean????\n\nThese will be Hilleries first
    \"reasonable gun laws\"\n\nStage 1:\nCome january hundreds of thousands of law
    abiding citizens will be forced to choose between turning in thier guns which
    they registered with the promise they would never be taken... \nGuns were added
    every year to the list so more and more had to be registered.\n\nIf I bring back
    across that border the 100 rounds of .22 in one pack I bought there. I will be
    a criminal...an illlegal ammunition importer.\n\nMy Ruger 10/22, every boys rifle
    is classified as an illegal assault weapon because it has a removable magazine...
    and the magazines I legally bought there are no criminal to possess.\n\nIf I want
    to loan my son any handgun I legally own at a firing range or on vast private
    land there... I must go to an FFL give him $20 and my son can pick it up in 10
    days.  Then shoot it \nBut if I give him 51 rounds, I am an illegal ammunition
    dealer.\n\nthen he takes it back to the gun store, and because I am not a resident.
    I have to pay $20 +$120 to fedex to ship it home to another FFL who also charges
    me $20 (so I am unarmed  on my drive home)\n\nStage 2:\nReasonable gun laws\nIf
    you pay the exorbinate license fees, you might be allowed to keep it at the range
    or hunting club. But you are NEVER allowed to use a firearm for self defense (england
    and austrialia). That is Hilleries gun laws.\n\n\nNext, she will bring in hundreds
    of thousands of Muslims who HATE infidels...All non Muslim US citizens are infidels.
    So they can molest your wife or daughter for walking around unescorted like in
    France."

<p>If Hillary Clinton wins, Barack Obama will take Antonin Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>You NeverTrump cowards need to go read everything you've written about Barack Obama. Read what you said about his sick dream to fundamentally transform America. Read everything you've written about his hatred of American exceptionalism.</p>
<p>But go deeper. Stop being cowards for ten minutes and recall what you've said and thought about Barack Obama. In private conversations. While reading an article in National Review or Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>And then admit that your vote for Hillary or for some loser 3rd party candidate is a vote to replace Scalia with Obama.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Why is Obama using the full power of the United States to help elect Hillary? They hate each other.</p>
<p>Obama wants the court, and Hillary will give it to him.</p>
<p>On this measure, Hillary is 10 times the deal-maker Trump is.</p>
<p>Trump has honor.</p>
<p>Trump is a patriot.</p>
<p>Trump would never make that deal.</p>
<p>But Hillary would.</p>
<p>And you would if you don't vote for Trump.</p>
<p>NeverTrumpers sicken me.</p>
