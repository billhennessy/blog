<p>Donna Brazile colluded with Hillary's campaign and Roland Martin to feed debate to questions to Hillary before a debate.</p>
<p>Hillary personally ordered violent protesters to disrupt Trump events.</p>
<p>Hillary, Brazile, and PACS broke the law by colluding on disrupting Trump events.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton trashed and intimidated the women her husband raped.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton stole classified material and her minions offered bribes the FBI to help cover up the crimes.</p>
<p>And now people tell us her criminal deeds are less bad than Trump's words.</p>
<p>I don't buy it.</p>
<p>I'm not going to tell you you're un-American if you don't vote for Trump, unless you have a soul. Unless you've read the Wikileaks. Unless want to live free.</p>
<p>Maybe you're okay with a felon for President, but I'm not. And for all his flaws, Trump has a plan that looks a lot like a plan I'd write.</p>
<p>America fell for Bill Clinton's lies in 1992. Now, I'll leave it to The Who.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'll tip my hat to the new constitution<br />
Take a bow for the new revolution<br />
Smile and grin at the change all around<br />
Pick up my guitar and play<br />
Just like yesterday<br />
Then I'll get on my knees and pray<br />
We don't get fooled again</p></blockquote>
