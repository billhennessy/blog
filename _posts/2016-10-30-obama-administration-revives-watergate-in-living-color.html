<p>Everyone knows that the White House is interfering with the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton's criminal conspiracies. We know this because <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/corrupt-obama-doj-moved-spike-comey-investigation-went-rogue-notified-congress/">the Justice Department is stonewalling the FBI's request for a warrant</a> to search the hard drive Huma Abedin shared with her ex-husband Anthony Weiner.</p>
<p>For those of us too young to remember those black-and-white days of Watergate, here's a brief timeline via <a href="http://watergate.info/chronology/brief-timeline-of-events">Watergate.info</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>July 13, 1973:</b>&nbsp;Alexander Butterfield, former presidential appointments secretary, reveals in congressional testimony that since 1971 Nixon had recorded all conversations and telephone calls in his offices.</li>
<li><b>July 18, 1973:</b>&nbsp;Nixon reportedly orders the White House taping system disconnected.</li>
<li><b>July 23, 1973:</b>&nbsp;Nixon refuses to turn over the presidential tape recordings to the Senate Watergate committee or the special prosecutor.</li>
<li><b>October 20, 1973:</b>&nbsp;Saturday Night Massacre: Nixon fires Archibald Cox and abolishes the office of the special prosecutor. Attorney General Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus resign. Pressure for impeachment mounts in Congress.</li>
<li><b>November 17, 1973:</b>&nbsp;Nixon declares, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a crook,&rdquo; maintaining his innocence in the Watergate case.</li>
<li><b>December 7, 1973:</b>&nbsp;The White House can&rsquo;t explain an 18 1/2 -minute gap in one of the subpoenaed tapes. Chief of staff Alexander Haig says one theory is that &ldquo;some sinister force&rdquo; erased the segment.</li>
</ul>
<p>That "sinister force" might have been Hillary Rodham. Maybe that's why the <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2008/04/60962/">Democrats fired her from the investigation's legal team</a>. Or maybe those honorable Democrats of yore simply recognized Hillary's rank corruption, her soulless evil, her selfish paranoia, and decided they'd rather die than risk contracting the virus that plagues her.</p>
<p>In RE: United States vs. Hillary Rodham Clinton, we know now that the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/10/30/clinton-foundation-fbi-investigation-confirmed-former-assistant-fbi-director/">FBI has merged the email investigation with the criminal probe of the Clinton Foundation</a>. We also know that Attorney General Loretta Lynch has stonewalled FBI requests for search warrants. It's pretty clear that Obama is protecting Clinton the same way Nixon protected himself.</p>
<p>Saturday night is over, but if Comey keeps pursuing the Clinton Crime Family, there will be another massacre. Nixon simply fired a meddlesome special prosecutor. The Clintons kill their problems another way. <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/10/02/killing-ron-brown/">They kill them</a>.</p>
