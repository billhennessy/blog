<p>Yesterday I speculated that <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/10/31/seems-like-obama-is-tired-of-hillarys-s/">Barack Obama had grown sick of Hillary's corruption</a>, lies, and criminal disregard for the rule of law.</p>
<p>A lot of people thought I was nuts, that I was reading too much into the White House statement that discredited Hillary's primary talking point about&nbsp;James Comey.</p>
<p>But today the <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/rats-jump-ship-michelle-obama-scrubs-hillary-clinton-twitter-history/">Gateway Pundit reports that <b>Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references</b></a><b> to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter timelines</b>. This seems to confirm my speculation that the Obamas are washing his hands of Crooked Hillary.</p>
<p>When you think about it, it's easy to see that <b>Hillary hurt Obama's legacy</b>. Her tenure as Secretary of State was a disaster. Wikileaks confirms what Obama might have suspected all along&mdash;that Hillary used her office as Secretary of State to shake down foreign and domestic actors for her private gain.</p>
<p>Expect Obama to throw Hillary under the bus before Tuesday.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Senator Elizabeth Warren has scrubbed Hillary from her @SenWarren timeline, too. It's down to one tweet from January, 2012. (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Hillary%20OR%20Clinton%20from%3ASenWarren&amp;src=typd">Here's the search</a>) Warren's old <a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/elizabethforma">@<span class="u-linkComplex-target">elizabethforma</span></a>&nbsp;timeline was also scrubbed back to 2012. Clearly, these Democrat women know something CNN doesn't.</p>
