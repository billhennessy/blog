<p>If your favorite player hits a home run or scores a goal, but your favorite team loses, what have you accomplished?</p>
<p>If an athlete you despise makes a horrible error but the hated team he plays for wins the championship, how do you feel?</p>
<p>In several races across Missouri, some people seem willing to lose the war if it means they can win their private battles. That&rsquo;s pretty sad, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>In the race for governor and the race for US Senate, I hear people working against their own interests for extremely selfish reasons. But the only way to show you're a consistent person is to elect Trump, Blunt, and Greitens on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>US Senate</h3>
<p>Suppose Donald Trump wins but Roy Blunt loses. And a few other Republican Senate candidates lose. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;possible that President Trump could face a Senate controlled by Democrats. In that case, you won&rsquo;t get a single piece of legislation you want. You&rsquo;ll get only what Mitch McConnell compromises with Chuck Schumer. Have fun with that.</p>
<p>Plus, Jason Kander is a far left progressive. He&rsquo;s opposed to the 2nd Amendment because he will get to keep his assault rifles and side arms. That&rsquo;s how elitism works, and Kander&rsquo;s all for different rules for different castes. And Kander loves the lobbyists as much as the lobbyists love Kander. It&rsquo;s a regular affair with those two.</p>
<p>If Hillary wins, don't you want every possible Republican Senator to form a firewall?</p>
<p>If you want Trump and Trump&rsquo;s policies, you have to give Trump a Senate that will enact those policies. Kander won&rsquo;t do that. Roy Blunt will. So vote for Blunt on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Missouri Governor</h3>
<p>Suppose Chris Koster wins. You won&rsquo;t ever see Right to Work in Missouri. All the good bills that Nixon vetoed, Koster will veto. All the favoritism Nixon showed, Koster will show. Missouri&rsquo;s embarrassing fall to the bottom of the economic barrel will continue. That fall might even accelerate. Who knows.</p>
<p>In Chris Koster&rsquo;s Missouri, failing schools and falling bridges will remain the norm. Fortune 1000 companies will continue to flee our state. And rioters will be allowed to control your streets. If Chris Koster was afraid to do something about Ferguson as the state&rsquo;s chief law enforcement officer, imagine how cowardly he&rsquo;d act as governor.</p>
<p>Or you can show consistency by voting for Eric Greitens. Greitens started off as a Democrat, but he realized his philosophy was out of sync with that party&rsquo;s beliefs. So he embraced the GOP and some of the most conservative GOP leaders embrace Greitens.</p>
<p>As governor, Eric Greitens will sign Right to Work. He will lead his party to make Missouri great again by getting us out of the bottom quintile of economic despair. Greitens will confront riots with all the determination and courage you&rsquo;d expect from a Navy SEAL war veteran. And he&rsquo;ll elevate our political discourse like no one else.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>Most people want to be seen as consistent. We want people&nbsp;to think we&rsquo;ll do the right thing even if it hurts. Maybe it hurts you to vote for Blunt or Greitens, but deep down you probably know voting for Blunt and Greitens is the right thing.</p>
<p>Trump will win Missouri by 15 percentage points if you vote. If Missouri voters do the right thing, Blunt and Greitens will win by 15 points, too. If they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s because many Missouri conservatives would rather lose the war for America than lose a skirmish for their pride. And that would be so sad.</p>
