<p>Jim Hoft. Ed Martin. John Burns. Dottie Bailey. Ben Evans. Gina Loudon. Lee Presser. Ben Murphy. Phyllis Schlafly.</p>
<p>Those are my friends who were on the Trump Train long before me. If not Day One, Day Two.</p>
<p>I resisted.</p>
<p>I wanted a kinder, gentler conservative. I was for Dr. Ben Carson.</p>
<p>But my friends opened my eyes.</p>
<p>Over time, they reminded me that the Tea Party was never about R vs. D or conservative vs. progressive.</p>
<p>The Tea Party was about the people vs. the elites.</p>
<p>Trump was the&nbsp;champion of the people.</p>
<p>Everybody else was with the elites. Almost everybody.</p>
<p>Once my eyes were opened, I saw.</p>
<p>I see that the American people are wiser than I ever gave them credit for.</p>
<p>Jefferson would be so proud. Reagan, too.</p>
<p>The shining city on the hill glows on.</p>
<p>Well done, America. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>Make America great again.</strong></p>
<p>Praise the Lord. Thank you, Saint Phyllis.</p>
