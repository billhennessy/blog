<p>Every day<a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/student-paddled-writing-trump-blackboard-school-banned-election-talk/"> teachers beat students who like Trump</a>.</p>
<p>Every day anti-Trump social justice warriors (SJWs) <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/high-school-girl-pummeled-scratched-thrown-ground-stomped-supporting-trump-video/">beat</a>, <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/atlanta-man-shot-dead-outside-bar-telling-hispanic-man-trump-going-deport/">shoot</a>, and <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/young-father-4-year-old-dies-anti-trump-protesters-block-roads-hospital/">kill</a> Trump supporters.</p>
<p>Every day, anti-Trump SJWs <a href="http://wtop.com/prince-william-county/2016/03/local-trump-supporter-says-shes-facing-harassment-vandalism/slide/1/">vandalize and harass businesses.</a></p>
<p>Every day, anti-Trump reporters lie.</p>
<p>And the anti-trumpets better change. Fast. Or there will be hell to pay.</p>
<p>People will put up with harassment and violence only so long.</p>
<p>People eventually push back.</p>
<p>People who fight as a last resort fight for their lives.</p>
<p>Stop the harassment or suffer the consequences of your evil decisions, Democrats. It's that simple.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating or endorsing violence. I'm telling you how it is. &nbsp;I'm old enough to know how this shit works. And you're working against yourselves right now.</p>
