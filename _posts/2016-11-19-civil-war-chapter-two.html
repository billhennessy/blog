<p>Roger pulled into the parking garage near St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital. Midday, the garage was packed. Roger parked on the roof and sprinted to the stairs. He crossed the short bridge to the third-floor reception area and approached the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Roger Thompson. My son David was brought here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The woman at the desk smiled at him, then typed on her keyboard. &ldquo;Can I see your driver&rsquo;s license please?&rdquo; she asked Roger.</p>
<p>Roger dug his wallet out of his back pocket and handed the woman his license. She looked at it, glanced at her computer monitor, and looked up to Roger. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the emergency room, 14. It&rsquo;s on one. The elevators over there will take you there. Follow the signs when you get to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger hurried to the elevator. He was still seething at the school and that bitch Flanders. When the elevator doors opened, he saw half a dozen sullen faces looking out at him. He joined them.</p>
<p>On floor one, Roger exited the elevator and looked for the signs.</p>
<p><-- RADIOLOGY<br />
URGENT CARE --></p>
<p>He followed the signs to the right through green tiled walls. That cottony smell of hospital struck him. Ridiculously wide double doors led to the emergency room. Roger plunged through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Thompson?&rdquo; he said to the nurse at the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a relative?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his dad,&rdquo; Roger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in 14. You may go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; He just turned and looked for room 14. Roger walked into the curtained room.</p>
<p>David lay on the gurney covered in a white blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; Roger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, dad,&rdquo; David said. He looked toward his father but made no attempt to smile. &ldquo;My head hurts. Can they turn the lights down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask. Anything besides your head hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David took a deep breath and looked at the ceiling. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. My mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s upper lip was swollen and bruised. Dried blood covered his arms. His hands were cut up. His hair was greasy and unkempt.</p>
<p>Roger felt pity and rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Roger said.</p>
<p>David looked at his father. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have said anything, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Roger asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just said I didn&rsquo;t think Trump was so bad. And Miss Mateo told me I was out of line. She said I could be expelled for supporting Trump. She said it&rsquo;s a hate crime. Intimidates people. It&rsquo;s a threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said it&rsquo;s a threat to say you don&rsquo;t think Trump&rsquo;s so bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David looked down at his bloodied hands. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. When she told me to go to Miss Flanders&rsquo; office, I just got up and walked down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger tried to imagine his son&rsquo;s perp walk to the principal&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;What happened there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I was just sitting outside her office and Kyle and a bunch of dudes walked up and started kicking me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They kicked you? Did they say anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They kicked me first. They were saying &lsquo;white supremacist&rsquo; and &lsquo;homophobe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they wouldn&rsquo;t stop, I stood up to get away from them. Somebody stabbed me with a pen. In my arm.&rdquo; David pointed to the puncture wound on his right forearm. &ldquo;Then they just jumped on me punching and kicking. I tried to fight back, but I fell and hit my head on the chair arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they stop then? When you hit your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David closed his eyes. &ldquo;No. They kept kicking and punching and calling me a racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Ms. Flanders come out and stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came out. She just stood there watching, though. She didn&rsquo;t say anything until I stopped trying fight back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger let that sink in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, son. You know that Ms. Flanders was wrong, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David looked at Roger. &ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger looked around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make her pay. Those boys, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dad. No. They&rsquo;ll do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ll be in jail. Or juvie or whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dad. Leave it alone. Miss Flanders told me that it will get worse if I tell anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David? Oh, my God,&rdquo; said Natalie Thompson.</p>
<p>Natalie rushed to the gurney and hugged her son. Then she looked at her husband and said, &ldquo;Roger, what the hell?&rdquo;</p>
