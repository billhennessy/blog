<p>Roger, David, and Natalie, drove home from the hospital in relative silence. It was already dark at six-thirty. Traffic was still snarled as drivers got used to the end of daylight savings.</p>
<p>When they arrived home, David went to his bedroom and Natalie followed. The post-concussion protocol called for lots of rest, no electronics, and soft lighting. David went straight to bed.</p>
<p>Roger walked into his home office with a glass of whiskey. He sat in his desk chair, leaned back, and took a sip of the booze. After a minute, he slid his phone from his pocket and dialed Jack Murphy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, man, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serious shit,&rdquo; said Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David got beat up at school for saying Trump isn&rsquo;t such a bad guy. The principal let the other boys beat him. He has a concussion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy shit! God almighty, Rog. What the fuck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; Roger asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sue! Sue their asses,&rdquo; yelled Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure the police reports are accurate. A police sergeant told me the cops who responded wrote one thing in their reports and told him something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious? How can that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger shook his head. Jack&rsquo;s the lawyer. Why wasn&rsquo;t he telling Roger how that can be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I need your help. Start the clock. I want that bitch fired and charged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got it. But if the cops won&rsquo;t cooperate, it&rsquo;ll be pretty tough. Teachers have a high level of credibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Cops do, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Roger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean. Let me handle this. I know you want to do something, but schools and cops need to be dealt with in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger knew what Jack was talking about. The idea of vengeance crossed his mind a hundred times since he took that call at work. He&rsquo;d imagined himself visiting those punks who beat his son, one by one. He saw himself ringing their doorbells. He saw their doors swing open. The culprit opens the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the kid says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to step outside?&rdquo; The kid steps outside closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>Roger looks at the kid. The kid seems half Roger&rsquo;s size, but the kid sees himself as Roger&rsquo;s equal. Maybe Roger&rsquo;s superior.&ldquo;You m&nbsp;with David. I&rsquo;m fucking with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You messed with David. I&rsquo;m messing with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kid&rsquo;s eyes grow wide.</p>
<p>Roger imagines himself driving his open palm into the kid&rsquo;s cheek in a violent, sideways swoop the brat never sees coming. He feels the kid&rsquo;s weight accelerate to his left. He imagines the kid crumpling down, folding up like a cheap suit. Roger, in his fantasy, turns and walks away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his fantasy. One by one they all go down. They all crumple under Roger&rsquo;s mighty right hand.</p>
<p><em>Jack&rsquo;s right,</em> he thought. <em>They&rsquo;re little kids. Get a hold of yourself, Thompson!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me the cop&rsquo;s info,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him and see what kind of case we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll take a picture of his card and send it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Roger, this will work out. Be patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you, Jack. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
