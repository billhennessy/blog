  content: President Elect Donald Trump said during the campaign that he would be
    and is the &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; candidate. Now, the media is saying Trump
    is walking back his call to prosecute Killary and Bill Clinton and the Clinton
    Foundation. Some people are jumping on that report claiming Trump is already breaking
    his campaign promises. First off, Trump does not take the job until January 20,
    2017. Second, it would be the FBI and the Justice Department that would do the
    investigation and prosecution. It would be the new Attorney General who would
    request a Special Prosecutor IF NEED BE, because the corrupt racist AG Loretta
    Lynch will be out of a job come January. The Attorney General is supposed to be
    an independent office having no influence from the president. However, how realistic
    is that when the position is by appointment from the President. You know Hussein
    Obama influenced decisions made by his AG&rsquo;s Holder and Lynch. That is why
    I would like to see the Attorney General be an elected office. It was a sad, sad
    day in America when the decision not to seek charges against Crooked Killary Clinton
    by FBI Director James Comey. It shows that the LAW does not apply to everyone.
    It shows that certain people are ABOVE the law depending on who you are. That
    should not happen in this country and why Killary Clinton needs to be prosecuted
    for her crimes, because Corruption by DemonRATS is a major problem facing this
    nation. No one should be above the law. Finally, to those who believe the reports
    that Trump is already breaking his campaign promises need to remember the so-called
    Mainstream Media have become the propaganda arm of the DemonRATS. They are failing
    at their responsibility afforded them under the First Amendment to be the watchdogs
    over government and are not to be believed or trusted. It has already been shown
    and proven through Wiki Leaks that the so-called Mainstream Media are in collusion
    with the Clinton campaign, the Obama Regime and the DemonRATS. So no right thinking
    people would get their news from any of the alphabet media aka. the propaganda
    arm of the DemonRATS.

  content: My objective is to drive the standards up, not down.  To let this unindicted
    criminal skate will significantly jeopardize the safety of our nation.  It will
    set a very, very bad precedent.  It's that rule of law thing that has been ignored
    for a long time.

<p>You might have heard that President-elect Trump has said he doesn't want to waste time and attention on Hillary's email server. You also might have heard that some people are upset about that. I'm not one of them.</p>
<p>Months ago I was telling people Trump should announce that, if elected, he will pardon Hillary Clinton for all crimes related to her email scandal. I had two reasons for promoting this strategy.</p>
<p>First, by announcing your intention to pardon her, you make her look guilty. Like when Ford pardoned Nixon. Even Clinton's supporters would have to argue with themselves whether she deserved to be pardoned or whether Trump was overstepping his authority as President. Plus, a pre-emptive pardon would have made people think past the sale. To have the self-debate, people would first have to see Trump as President.</p>
<p>Second, like Ford's pardon of Nixon, it would signal a focus on fixing real problems for the future instead of settling scores from the past. In 1974, inflation was going crazy. Gerald Ford needed to put Watergate behind him so he could order a couple million <a href="http://www.history.com/speeches/ford-pledges-to-whip-inflation-now">Whip Inflation Now buttons</a> to pass out to people in lieu of actual solutions. President Trump will take office with a stagnant economy and a big debt to members of the former middle class in America--the blue-collar workers who put incredible faith in a bombastic billionaire from Queens. The last thing Trump needs is the distraction of the Clintons' various scandals. If the next four years are all about Hillary's crimes and cover-ups, she might as well have won.</p>
<p>There's another reason I like Trump's decision to let others in the his administration worry about the Clintons. <strong>I want to forget about the Clintons.</strong> They're old, they're sickly, and they won't be around very long. I want to focus, instead, on making America great again, getting middle-class wages growing again, and reducing the amount of war and terrorism in the world.</p>
<p>That said, I have no problem with the FBI and DOJ continuing their investigations of Hillary and the Clinton Foundation. If either investigation uncovers crimes, I'd like to see an independent prosecutor decide what to do. Same goes for the people who broke immunity deals during the server investigation. And if the DOJ determines Hillary broke the law, a special prosecutor should look into that, too.</p>
<p>In short, I want to see justice done, but I want Trump left free to do what he does best: working 19 hours a day and making huge decisions quickly to make America great again. Embroiling himself in the Clintons' sordid affairs can't help his agenda.</p>
<p>With all the troubles in the world, the crimes of two small people from Arkansas don't amount to a hill of beans. Trump and the American people already served the Clintons with the most painful punishment they could receive. Hillary will never be the first female President, and Bill will have to pay his "interns" out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>That's enough justice for me. Plus, <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/11/20/donations-to-clinton-foundation-fell-by-37-percent/">donations to the Clinton Foundation are down 37 percent</a> since the election. So <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/11/06/chelsea-clinton-used-foundation-to-help-pay-for-wedding-emails/">Chelsea's hurting, too</a>.</p>
<p>Let's keep our eyes on the prize. Make America great again. We can do that without settling old scores. And magnanimity is a fine quality in a leader.</p>
