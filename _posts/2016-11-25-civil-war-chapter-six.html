<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Evan, this is Roger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going? Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at home. Listen, I&rsquo;m going to have&nbsp;to use a sick day today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really. It&rsquo;s a long story. David got beat up pretty bad yesterday at school. In school,&rdquo; Roger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hell. Sorry to hear that. Don&rsquo;t worry about anything. I&rsquo;ve got you covered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Evan. Sorry about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries. It&rsquo;s the slow season anyway. You take care of your family. Take time next week if you need to. It&rsquo;s a short week, anyway, with Thanksgiving.&rdquo; For a second-generation business owner, Evan was liberal with time off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. I might have to. There&rsquo;ll probably be lawyers involved."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that sucks. What happened?&rdquo; asked Evan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like I said, it&rsquo;s a long story. Apparently, some political class got out of hand. A bunch of kids jumped David, and the principal stood by and let them beat on him. Put him in the hospital with a concussion and a bunch of cuts and bruises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy. Wow. Yeah, get lawyered up. What did the police say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange, too. I have to call the sergeant in a minute. They seem to be afraid to cross the teachers' union,&rdquo; Roger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God almighty. Those unions stick together, don&rsquo;t they? We need a union for businesses,&rdquo; Evan said. Roger thought <em>Isn't the chamber of commerce your union?</em> but he didn't say it. Instead, he said, &ldquo;Yeah. The whole day was weird. I'm sorry I didn&rsquo;t call you yesterday. By the time they discharged David, it was late."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t mention it. You did the right thing,&rdquo; said Evan. &ldquo;Tell Natalie I&rsquo;m sorry. David, too. You take care of that family, Roger. Work will be here when you get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Evan. I&rsquo;ll let you go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. Take care, buddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger looked at his phone. Nine-thirty. He looked at the list he&rsquo;d scribbled down last night:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Call Evan</li>
<li>[ ] Call Sgt. Franklin</li>
<li>[ ] Call Jack Murphy</li>
<li>[ ] Call school?</li>
</ul>
<p>Natalie was taking care of calls to the doctors. She also called the school to tell them David would not be in. Roger was afraid he&rsquo;d lose it if he heard &ldquo;that bitch&rsquo;s&rdquo; voice. He couldn&rsquo;t remember Nancy Flanders&rsquo; name, only &ldquo;that bitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something was bothering Roger, but he couldn&rsquo;t exactly describe the irritation. Something gnawing at his mind just out of consciousness. He figured it was the incomplete checklist, so I dialed Franklin&rsquo;s number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Mike Franklin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant, Roger Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm wondering if you&rsquo;ve filed charges against any of the kids or the principal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin paused. &ldquo;The case is still under investigation, Mr. Thompson. I have no further updates. I expect it will be turned over to a detective today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? It seems pretty obvious to me. A principal stood by while seven or eight kids beat up my son. And my son says a teacher triggered the whole incident by calling him a&nbsp;racist in class. She accused him of hate crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin paused again. <em>Six months,</em> he thought to himself. &ldquo;Listen, Mr. Thompson, you should probably get a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Roger interrupted. &ldquo;He should be calling you today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll wait for the call,&rdquo; said Franklin.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Franklin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant, this is Jack Murphy. I&rsquo;m an attorney representing the Thompson family regarding an incident that took place at Briarhaven Elementary School yesterday. Mr. Roger Thompson gave me your card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. How can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see the police reports from the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s juveniles involved. A judge will have to grant you permission to see the records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. So maybe I can get your take. You don&rsquo;t have to mention any names. Just the facts as you know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin looked around. Everyone in the room was busy with something else. &ldquo;What did Mr. Thompson tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said a group of boys beat up his son, David, at school. The principal witnessed the beating and did nothing to intervene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Franklin considered his response. &ldquo;Can I get your number? I&rsquo;ll call you if I have any information I can disclose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Jack. He gave the sergeant his number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I&rsquo;ll be in touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike Franklin sat back in his chair and looked out the window. &ldquo;Six months to retirement,&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;Six fucking months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin pulled out a notepad and his personal cell phone. He tapped out a text message, sent it, and put the phone and notepad back in his pockets. Next, he stood up and walked to a table containing stacks of manila folders. He pulled the top folder off one of the stacks and opened it. He removed a few sheets of paper, walked to a copier, and set the pages in the feeder. He pressed a button and the copier sprang to life.</p>
