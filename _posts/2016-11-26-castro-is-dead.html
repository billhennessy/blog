  content: "The statements made by President-Elect Donald Trump and Hussein Obama
    show the contrast between the two men. Trump knows who America&rsquo;s true allies
    are and who America's true enemies are. Unlike,Hussein Obama who sides with America's
    enemies and rejects America's allies. Trump spoke the truth about the brutal dictator
    Fidel Castro, whereas, Hussein Obama praises him. \nTrump said:\n&ldquo;Today,
    the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people
    for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro&rsquo;s legacy is one of firing squads, theft,
    unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.&rdquo;
    \n  &ldquo;While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today
    marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in
    which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,&rdquo;
    Trump said.\n&ldquo;Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro
    cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people
    can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty,&rdquo; Trump said.
    &ldquo;I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential
    campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with
    the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.&rdquo;\nHussein Obama: &ldquo;At
    this time of Fidel Castro&rsquo;s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the
    Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans &ndash; in Cuba and in the
    United States &ndash; with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in
    which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the
    Cuban nation,&rdquo; Obama said in a statement put out by the White House.\n&ldquo;History
    will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people
    and world around him,&rdquo; Obama said.\n&ldquo;For nearly six decades, the relationship
    between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political
    disagreements,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;During my presidency, we have worked hard
    to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between
    our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that
    we share as neighbors and friends &ndash; bonds of family, culture, commerce,
    and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans,
    who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones
    in Cuba.&rdquo;\nThe mistake America made by electing this POS, Community Agitator,
    Hussein Obama is coming to an end."

<p>We can close the books on the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castro was greeted in hell by his peers Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, Mussolini, and Hitler.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castro was last seen paddling away from the Caribbean hellhole on a raft bound for hell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castro leaves behind a nation trapped in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Repeating our top story tonight: Cuban dictator Fidel Castro is still valiantly holding on in his fight to remain dead.&nbsp;</p>
