    I didn't quote Dr. Oz, of course. Someone else did. I quoted them.

    Has Dr. Oz, in your view, ever said anything that was accurate? Or is everything he says automatically the opposite?

  content: Nothing but sugar bombs! If you follow the USDA food pyramid and/or the
    American Diabetes diet you'll only get fatter, more insulin resistant and be on
    your way to type 2 diabetes. Low Carb High Fat is the winner, don't believe me
    . . . go to www.dietdoctor.com  . . . and do your homework.

    government and doctors to push sugar and wheat. It's immoral.\n\nBTW, for breakfast
    I had eggs, bacon, and sausage. I won't be hungry again until dinner. People who
    ate wheat, sugar, and fruit went back for seconds. I watched. It's automatic. "

  content: Eggs , bacon, Kerrygold butter, Coconut Almond beverage, coffee with heavy
    cream, vegies that I thought I would never eat and now love (cooked in butter
    no less). Throw in some intermittent fasting. Lost weight so fast it scarred me.
    Next the best lipid panel EVER. Doc doesn't get it, probably never will, too bad
    for him and the rest of his patients he stuffs full of statins and insulin.

<p>Kellogg sells mostly simple carbohydrates in the form of breakfast cereal and snacks. Their ad agencies make you think their foods are wholesome and safe. They're not. They're mostly simple carbohydrates (grains and sugar) that <strong>produce a glycemic shock when eaten</strong>. And foods that produce glycemic shock seem to be deadlier than cigarettes. At least that's the suggestion from <a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/25/3/532.abstract">a recent study at the&nbsp;University of Texas</a>.</p>
<p>The study of 2,000 lung cancer patients and 2,500 people without lung cancer should raise concern. <strong>Tony the Tiger might pose a greater threat to your kids than Joe Camel ever did</strong>. Via <a href="http://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Carbs-and-Cancer-New-study-suggests-carbs-are-worse-than-cigarettes-371521471.html">WSAZ Channel 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers looked at 2,000 patients with lung cancer and 2,500 without.</p>
<p>They say <strong>non-smokers whose diets had a high glycemic index were more than two times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than non-smokers with a low one.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Oz says, "A high glycemic index means that the sugar in whatever food you're eating rushes into your bloodstream because it's not cobbled together with fiber that would naturally hold it together in your gut."</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's more from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/10/health/carbs-and-lung-cancer/index.html">CNN</a>></p>
<p>And from the American Diabetes Association, here are examples of foods with a high glycemic index:</p>
<p><strong>High GI (70 or more)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>White bread or bagel</li>
<li>Corn flakes, puffed rice, bran flakes, instant oatmeal</li>
<li>Short grain white rice, rice pasta, macaroni and cheese from mix</li>
<li>Russet potato, pumpkin</li>
<li>Pretzels, rice cakes, popcorn, saltine crackers melons and pineapple</li>
</ul>
<p><em>See more </em>at:<em> http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html#sthash.MigP2Hzv.dpuf</em></p>
<p>And here's a longer list of glycemic indexes for products, including many Kellogg products from <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods">Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, Kellogg isn't the only company that packages glycemic poison as wholesome health food. I'm singling out Kellogg because Kellogg has singled out people like me for a hate and acrimony campaign of epic proportions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/01/kellogg-foundation-provided-nearly-1-million-support-black-lives-matter/">Kellogg donated nearly $1 million to Black Lives Matter</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/30/dumpkelloggs-kelloggs-declares-hate-45-million-americans-blacklisting-breitbart/">Kellogg pulled advertising from Breitbart News</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://mediatrackers.org/ohio/2012/12/03/kellogg-foundation-arc-lead-voter-suppression-charge">Kellogg Foundation funds efforts to destroy True the Vote</a>.</p>
<p>And Breitbart chronicles a whole list of Kellogg and <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/30/dumpkelloggs-far-left-cereal-giant-kelloggs-warns-of-racial-privilege/">Kellogg Foundation crimes against America</a>.</p>
<p>And Kellogg says terrible things about a lot of Americans who probably eat their poison.</p>
<p>Breitbart provides a convenient list of Kellogg's potentially deadly products. Before you reach for any of these, you might consider the healthier alternative of a cigarette.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Here's <a href="http://acecomments.mu.nu/?post=367133">great wisdom from Ace of Spades</a>.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Some of Kellogg&rsquo;s brands:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p6">Kellogg&rsquo;s Frosted Flakes&reg;</li>

<li class="p6">All-Bran&reg;</li>
<li class="p6">Apple Jacks&reg;</li>
<li class="p6">Crunchmania</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of these things are toasted. Like Lucky Strikes.</p>

<p>If you want to know why Americans are so fat, it might be because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/official-advice-to-eat-low-fat-diet-is-wrong-says-health-charity">governments and doctors have been lying to you</a> about what to eat, especially when it comes to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mercola/the-cholesterol-myth-that_b_676817.html">carbohydrates and cholesterol</a>. Possibly because companies like Kellogg pay them to lie to you? It's called lobbying, and <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000026978">Kellogg's done a ton of it since 2012 according to OpenSecrets.org</a>. How many studies have they suppressed?</p>
<p>Kellogg's stock is down, and it'll probably go lower. Especially when people start to realize Kellogg's products could be killing their kids. Awful.</p>
