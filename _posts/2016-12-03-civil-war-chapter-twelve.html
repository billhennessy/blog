<p>Roger crashed into his office. His sanctuary. It was only two fifteen, but he wanted a drink. Calls first.</p>
<p>He pulled out is cell phone and decided to call the cop again. But the phone buzzed in his hand before he could find the number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Roger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mr. Thompson? This is Amanda Mateo, one of David&rsquo;s teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi. Ms. Mateo. Yeah, we met in August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, right. Parents&rsquo; Night. Of course. Listen, I wanted to find out how David&rsquo;s doing. I felt so bad yesterday. Is he okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger wasn&rsquo;t sure how much to trust this woman. Her class led to his son&rsquo;s brutal beating. And it opened up a rift in his marriage.</p>
<p>But Roger knew David needed allies, and David seemed to trust her. &ldquo;David seems to be doing better today. He has a lot of cuts and puncture wounds. And concussions are scarier now than when I was a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; Amanda said. &ldquo;Mr. Thompson, I know you probably think I&rsquo;m terrible for what I did. And it sounds awful to say I was following orders, but I didn&rsquo;t know what would happen. If I&rsquo;d known, I&rsquo;d have said &lsquo;no&rsquo; to the lesson plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger heard something in her voice. Sincerity? Pain? Guilt? &ldquo;Well, David is pretty adamant that you were not the problem, Ms. Mateo. He said you helped him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to think about that information. &ldquo;I tried to. But only after I followed the plan. I really didn&rsquo;t expect something like that to happen. I want David to be alright. He is a great, great kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he is,&rdquo; Roger said. &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I also wanted to tell you something else,&rdquo; Amanda said. &ldquo;I talked to Sergeant Franklin today, and he had me give a sworn statement about what happened. It looks like my statement is consistent with David&rsquo;s. But some other statements are very different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Franklin warned me about that yesterday,&rdquo; Roger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. The school tried to make me sign a statement that made David look like a monster. I refused. That&rsquo;s when I went to the police and gave them my statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, making David a monster?&rdquo; Roger asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can show you the statement they wanted me to sign. It&rsquo;s awful. It&rsquo;s all lies. I got suspended for refusing to sign it, but I&rsquo;m not going to throw David under the bus. Never. He&rsquo;s a great kid. He got beat up by eight kids. The principal did nothing to help him. If I didn&rsquo;t go down there and try to break it up I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any reservations Roger held about Ms. Mateo&rsquo;s credibility were gone now. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thanks for looking out for David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem, sir. I want kids to be kids for a change. They don&rsquo;t need to be involved in grown-up things. They need to be kids, doing kid things. Mr. Thompson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see David, if that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See David? Yeah. Sure. When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you think it&rsquo;s okay. I don&rsquo;t want to disturb him if he&rsquo;s not ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger thought about David&rsquo;s condition. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we see how he&rsquo;s doing tomorrow? I know it&rsquo;s Saturday, but he&rsquo;s supposed to be sleeping a lot until the headaches subside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t have any plans tomorrow.. Or Sunday, except for mass. Will you call me when you think he&rsquo;s ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. This number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s my cell phone. If I don&rsquo;t answer, just leave a message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I will. Thank you. Thank you for protecting him. And I know you were just doing your job when this all started. I don&rsquo;t blame you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Thompson. That makes me feel better. Please tell David I am thinking about him and praying for him. I&rsquo;m going to light a candle for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger wasn&rsquo;t Catholic, but he knew lighting a candle for someone is a pretty big deal for Catholics. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful, Ms. Mateo. Thank you. it means a lot.&rdquo; And he was serious. Her words, her call, meant a lot to him in that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David will be thrilled to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too. Talk soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the call, Roger remembered meeting all of David's teachers in August. Natalie was there, too, of course. The teachers that Natalie liked, Roger didn&rsquo;t. And the teachers that Roger liked, Natalie didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Ms. Mateo was one of the teachers Roger liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just thought she was hot,&rdquo; Natalie said of Ms. Mateo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Roger said. "She really seemed to like David. And she's friendly. But, yeah, she's pretty, too."</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like twenty-two, Grandpa. Get over it,&rdquo; Natalie told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s closer to twenty-eight or twenty-nine. She just looks twenty-two,&rdquo; said Roger. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m happily married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Natalie looked at her husband. &ldquo;Maybe you are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Who was that?" Natalie asked. Roger didn't notice when she walked into his office.</p>
<p>"David's teacher," he said. "The one who broke up the fight. Ms. Mateo."</p>
<p>"What did she want?" Natalie said.</p>
<p>"She wants to see David."</p>
<p>Natalie looked at her husband for a few seconds, then turned and started to leave. "I hope you said no," she said as she walked down the hall.</p>
<p><em>How am I going explain this</em>, Roger thought.</p>
