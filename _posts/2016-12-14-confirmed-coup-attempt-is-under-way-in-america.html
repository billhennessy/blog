<p>You might have thought I was paranoid for wondering if some people in the CIA and the Deep State are plotting a coup to overturn our recent election.</p>
<p><strong>The Wall Street Journal seems to agree with my conclusion: a coup attempt is going on in America.</strong> Rogue actors within the CIA, all of the major leftist media (New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS), and probably major defense contractors seem to be involved, though the Wall Street Journal stops short of accusing advertisers. That's understandable.</p>
<p>You're probably thinking about the word "coup" yourself a lot. <strong>You'll probably hear "coup" on the news in the coming days</strong>. And you'll hear about more threats to Electors who plan to vote for Donald Trump on December 19. You will want to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/an-electoral-college-coup-1481590179">remember these words from the Wall Street Journal's editors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only a few weeks ago&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign was denouncing&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;as un-American for saying the election might be &ldquo;rigged.&rdquo; We criticized Mr. Trump at the time. But now that Mrs. Clinton has lost, her campaign is claiming the election really was rigged, albeit for Mr. Trump by Russian meddling, and <strong>it wants the Electoral College to stage what amounts to a coup</strong>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to interpret the extraordinary statement Monday by Clinton campaign chairman&nbsp;John Podesta&nbsp;endorsing a special intelligence briefing for electors a week before they cast their ballots for President on Dec. 19. He released the statement hours after 10 members of the Electoral College sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper seeking information on foreign interference in the election to judge if Mr. Trump &ldquo;is fit to serve.&rdquo; One of those electors is House Minority Leader&nbsp;Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s daughter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, I was way in front of the WSJ on this coup business. First, <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/12/11/is-the-cia-plotting-a-coup/">Is the CIA Plotting a Coup? <em>UPDATE</em> FBI Disputes CIA Allegation &ndash; VIDEOS</a>.</p>
<p>Then, yesterday, I pondered&nbsp;<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/12/12/why-trump-might-never-become-president/">Why Trump Might Never Become President</a>.</p>
<p>I admit that my posts sounded a little paranoid. But it turns out I'm not alone. <strong>The staid Wall Street Journal now uses the "coup" word to describe what's going on in this country</strong>. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/an-electoral-college-coup-1481590179">Here's more from Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What should really distress Americans is that the losers are trying to overturn the election results based on little more than anonymous leaks and innuendo. Whatever Russia&rsquo;s hacking motives, there is no evidence that the emails it turned up were decisive to the election result. Mr. Podesta is citing a CIA judgment that Americans have never seen and whose findings are vaguely public only because one or more unidentified officials chose to relate them to a few reporters last week.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you find yourself feeling scared or angry, you know why now. This is a serious coup attempt by the left wing and the Deep State to overturn a US election. Wars have been fought over less.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal concludes that the Democrats and the press probably know their Electoral College coup will fail. Maybe the left's motive is only to make the Unites States ungovernable, to throw the country into violent chaos. Would that be any nobler a goal? Seeking chaos is a kind of evil, is it not?</p>
<p>What will those Democrats try next? Nothing lies beneath them.</p>
