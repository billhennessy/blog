<p>Dear Mr. Hennessy,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of RT TV - 24/7 English language news station in Moscow broadcasting internationally.</p>
<p>My name is Ekaterina, I am a producer of the panel discussion program called CrossTalk.</p>
<p>I have the honor to invite you to our program.</p>
<p>We're recording it on Thursday, December 22, at 9 AM St. Louis time</p>
<p>We'll be talking about Sabotaging Trump?</p>
<p>Since his unexpected election the media and liberal political<br />
establish has sought to undermine and de-legitimize Donald Trump.<br />
Should we expect this to continue after he is sworn in January?</p>
<p>Will Trump and the corporate mainstream media ever have a normal relationship?</p>
<p>Agree or disagree: Trump will have a very stormy relationship with the GOP.</p>
<p>Do those who claim Trump is some kind of &ldquo;Russia agent&rdquo; also risk<br />
undermining confidence on the electoral process and political<br />
integrity of the country?</p>
<p>How could Trump change the country in a positive way? How could Trump<br />
change the country in a negative way?</p>
<p>It goes without saying that we will be grateful to have you on the program!<br />
Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Ekaterina Chekushkina<br />
