<p>When your brain automatically alters perceptions, there's something wrong with you.</p>
<p>Reporters have this psychosis. Journalists. They have very bad ADHD it seems. They can't pay attention. Like kids with ADHD. Chuck Todd and everybody at Business Insider should probably take Ritalin or something.</p>
<p><strong>Reporters are also narcissists</strong>. No one goes into journalism unless they have a <strong>pathologically inflated ego</strong>. No one.</p>
<p>So I'm going to walk you through the proof, slowly, so even our narcissistic, hyperactive, attention-deficit-disordered journalists can understand that Sean Spicer played with them like a cat pawing a dying moth.</p>
<p>The press is making much ballyhoo over Sean Spicer's first press statement Saturday. Even the crooked liars at PolitiFact have gotten into the fray. <strong>But the press and PolitiFact are "verifying" the facts of something Spicer didn't say.</strong> In other words, because of their maniacal&nbsp;hatred of Donald Trump and his voters, the narcissists in the press are verifying a "fact" that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>First, let's look at what the press heard Spicer say, then we'll see what Spicer actually said.</p>
<p><strong>The idiots in the press heard Spicer say&nbsp;&ldquo;This was the largest audience to ever to attend an inauguration &mdash; PERIOD.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>To refute what their brains invented, the press posted about 7 terabytes of photos comparing the Washington Mall on January 20, 2009, to the same Mall on January 20, 2017. In their self-deception, they say "Hah! Spicer's WRONG!" Then they go off to congratulate themselves.</p>
<p>Had Spicer said what the press heard, the press would be right. But <strong>journalist's brains don't register what's said, even when the journalists write the words themselves</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's what Spicer actually said:&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>This was the largest audience to ever <em>witness</em> an inauguration &mdash; PERIOD.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Over 30 million people witnessed the inauguration of Donald J. Trump--the second-most in history.</strong>&nbsp; But many <strong>millions more live streamed this inauguration</strong>, like me, meaning far more people watch Trump's inauguration than any other past President. CNN.com registered 16 million live stream viewers alone. Here's what<a href="http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/21/trump-inauguration-ratings/"> Entertainment Weekly said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And actually, <strong>Trump could have been seen by </strong><strong><em>more</em></strong><strong> viewers than either Obama or Reagan</strong>. Nielsen ratings do not account for online viewing, which has grown sharply in recent years and is far more commonplace than even four years ago. <strong>CNN.com, for example, clocked 16.9 million live streams,</strong> tying&nbsp;with its Election Day coverage for the site&rsquo;s top event (live stream tallies are typically not apples-to-apples with Nielsen&rsquo;s strict methodology of counting average viewers, but are still additive). <strong>Plus, portals like YouTube,&nbsp;Facebook and Twitter </strong><strong><a href="https://9to5google.com/2017/01/20/how-to-watch-trumps-inauguration-live-on-youtube-android-chrome-os-and-android-tv/" target="_blank">offered live streams</a> as well</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Spicer actually said was accurate. But accuracy was never important to a journalist.</p>
<p><strong>Journalists' brains don't work right</strong>. They're not right in the head, as Carl Childers might say. Even when they're staring at Spicer's actual words, their brains substitute "attended" for "witness." And even when I point this out to them, <strong>they are psychologically incapable of processing the actual words.</strong> Even Chris Wallace's brain said "attend" while his eyes were reading "witness." That's how powerful this journalistic psychosis is. Here's what Wallace read today on Fox News Sunday (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/01/22/priebus-will-not-let-media-delegitimize-this-president-mcconnell-on/">transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>And then through Spicer <strong>he [Trump] said that this was the biggest audience ever to *attend* an inauguration</strong>. That&rsquo;s also not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>See how pervasive this psychosis is? Chris Wallace's eyes saw the word "witness," but his mind read "attend." The two words don't even look like each other. Dyslexia can't account for such a word scramble. Only psychosis explains it. Only psychosis.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <strong>the hags who marched on Washington yesterday got kicked below the fold</strong> because the moronic press obsessed over a word substitution in their disordered brains.</p>
<p>Sad!</p>
