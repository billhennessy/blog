<p>It's great to be right.</p>
<p>Yesterday I told you that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer played the White House press corps by telling the truth. But the press corps and many Americans have a psychosis that literally replaces some words with other words. It's not dyslexia. It's far worse because it's selective.</p>
<p>In this case, Spicer said "witness" but journalists everywhere repeated, "attend." I <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2017/01/23/how-to-spot-journalisms-psychosis/">wrote about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Well, today, Spicer explained the situation to a psychotic journalist almost the same way I did. Listen closely to this exchange:</p>

<p><strong>Note: Starts at 25:30 mark.</strong></p>
<p>Any reasonable person now realizes that journalists are psychotic. Even though they wrote down that Spicer said "witness," their minds operated as if he'd said, "attend."</p>
<p>I am right.</p>
