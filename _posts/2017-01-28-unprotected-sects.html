<p>The television activists at CNN look like college seniors who learned upon returning from winter break that credit requirements for graduation were just upped from 120 hours to 180 hours. And there ain't grandfathering!</p>
<p>Diehard NeverTrumpers attack Trump supporters on social media like bitter, divorcing spouses locked in a pitched custody battle. And there ain't no reconciliation!</p>
<p>Establishment Republicans, Democrats who count on union support, the more radical unions like SEIU and NEA, Planned Parenthood baby killers, and tenured communist professors shriek like hormone-crazed adolescents in fall-down hysterics.</p>
<p>Spoiled Hollywood knuckle-dragger elitists blather like untreated schizophrenic alcoholics in a failed 1960s UCLA Film School student project.</p>
<p>And working class heroes, the guys you've never seen without a ball cap, who were "displaced" by the elites' greedy schemes to rid the world of people unlike themselves&mdash;the "unprotected" people of whom Bill Clinton said they "work hard and play by the rules"&mdash;those long-unprotected millions go about life exuding a fresh sunshine quiet optimism.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2017/01/14/americas-business-is-jobs-not-college/">the people who shower in the evening</a>, it's Morning in America Again.</p>
<p>Donald J. Trump's first whirlwindhyperloopmagnettrainrocketship&nbsp;of a first week left the Washington old guard feeling old, slow, and unprotected. And the frenzied speed of this First Week of American Greatness poured salt on the wounds of the stumbling elites. Trump moved so fast, so wildly that lifelong Reagan worshipers (like me) had to re-evaluate our presidential-preference rankings only one week into Trump's America. Dilbert creator <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/156399716951/outrage-dilution">Scott Adams described it best</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In only a few days, Trump has made us question what-the-hell every other president was doing during their first weeks in office. Were they even trying?</p></blockquote>
<p>Hard-left-fake-news blog <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/president-trump-week-one-first-administration-214699">Politico</a> described the week this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s first seven days in office were historic, chaotic, often astonishing and sometimes unsettling. With a flurry of provocative executive orders, surreal events, unapologetic falsehoods and did-he-really-say-that tweets, Trump continued to obliterate political norms, serving notice that the gaze of history won&rsquo;t change who he is. He made so much news and did so many unorthodox things that it was hard to keep track of everything that was changing in Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Trump's official actions came so fast only The Guardian seemed able to keep track with this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/trump-first-12-official-presidential-actions">handy list of 20 first week actions</a>, Trump's genius for scrambling reporters' brains protected his work from their fake-news, propagandist lies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything Donald Trump does is strategically calculated to achieve a goal. His communication is designed not to simply convey his gut feelings, but to make people focus on <i>one </i>thing &mdash; call it a decoy &mdash; so he can do six other things while they&rsquo;re distracted.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/27/dr-keith-ablow-whats-really-going-on-in-trumps-mind-hint-its-not-what-think.html">Dr. Keith Albow, a psychiatrist, writing on FoxNews.com</a>. Dr. Albow explains something very important:</p>
<blockquote><p>For journalists who still don&rsquo;t get it, here it is, again, in direct terms: When Trump says something like &ldquo;If I were you I would take your camera and look at the size of the crowd,&rdquo; he is actually saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s debate crowd size, again, because otherwise you might ask me questions about my real and historically powerful plans and ideas, which I don&rsquo;t trust you to report on fairly, anyhow.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott Adams says much the same:</p>
<blockquote><p>You&rsquo;re probably seeing the best persuasion you will ever see from a new president. Instead of dribbling out one headline at a time, so the vultures and critics can focus their fire, Trump has flooded the playing field. You don&rsquo;t know where to aim your outrage. He&rsquo;s creating so many opportunities for disagreement that it&rsquo;s mentally exhausting. Literally. He&rsquo;s wearing down the critics, replacing their specific complaints with entire encyclopedias of complaints. And when Trump has created a hundred reasons to complain, do you know what impression will be left with the public?</p>
<p><i><b>He sure got a lot done.</b></i></p></blockquote>
<p>It was the most productive week of any president in US history by leaps and bounds. Twenty official policy actions, countless strategic distractions, and 24/7 control of the news cycle. The media elite are Trump's unwitting accomplices in everything he does.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the plight of the elites.</p>
<p>Remember how Peggy Noonan labeled the establishment and the people last year? The protected and the unprotected:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those who come to this space know why I think what happened, happened. The unprotected people of America, who have to live with Washington&rsquo;s policies, rebelled against the protected, who make and defend those policies and who care little if at all about the unprotected. That broke bonds of loyalty and allegiance. Tuesday was in effect an uprising of the unprotected. It was part of the push-back against detached elites that is sweeping the West and was seen most recently in the Brexit vote. (<a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/11/11/how-donald-trump-completed-the-tea-party/">Link available here</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Call it "protection reassignment."</p>
<p>Donald Trump needed only one speech and one week to turn the tables on that Elitist Protection Racket. Now, the people feel protected and the (former?) elites feel naked and afraid. Those sniveling elitists are America's new unprotect sects.</p>
<p>Anyone feel bad for them?</p>
