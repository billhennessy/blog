<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reaching out because I noticed that you reviewed the book Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. I recently finished writing a book that&rsquo;s of a similar subject matter and I thought it might interest you. In about an hour, you could learn the language of intellectual property &ndash; you'll come out knowing more than 90% of the general public. </p>
<p>Would you consider reviewing this book if I provide you an e-copy? It&rsquo;s called Key to IP: Identifying Your Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Trade Secrets, and it will be published on Amazon in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your time and consideration!</p>
<p>Thanks so much,</p>
<p>Chris Weiss, Esq.<br />
