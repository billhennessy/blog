<p>Imagine Michael Jordan's best game ever. Or Tiger Woods. That's what it was like watching President Trump today. Amazing.</p>
<p>The President looked poised, cheerful, and humorous. He volleyed with Jim Acosta of CNN. He rated each question "good" or "bad." He explained why he doesn't want a nuclear war with Russia because the press seems to think nuclear war is a good thing. He mocked those in the press who want him to bomb that Russian intel ship off Virginia.</p>
<p>His maturity and gravitas made the press look like coked-up chimpanzees by contrast. He destroyed them. I bet a lot of White House correspondents are blowing 0.23 on breathalyzers tonight. They were ruined. They're narrative, months in the making, erased. Trump took a powerful magnet to their biased hard drives. And Jim Acosta is now to Trump <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-01-23-ronald-reagan-sam-donaldson_N.htm">what Sam Donaldson was to Reagan</a>: his straight man.</p>
<p>It was the best hour+ of Donald Trump's political career. If you missed it, <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5325996040001/?#sp=show-clips">watch the whole thing on FoxNews.com</a>. This is one for the ages!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2017/02/16/trump-triumphs-over-press/">Rush Limbaugh raved</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trump is the guy calling them out. <strong>I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this today</strong>. I have never seen it. <strong>We have wanted Republican presidents all of my life to deal with these people this way, and the only thing we ever got was Spiro Agnew</strong>. We&rsquo;ve not seen anything like this, and Trump did it with an air of confidence and self-assuredness. <strong>He was not nervous at all. He was having fun with them. He was toying with them</strong>. It&rsquo;s like if you got a cat. You know how you get these little laser pointers and you have a little kitten or a cat and the cat goes nuts chasing the light? It will run into a wall.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s what I was watching here today. It was just&hellip; It was fantastic, and <strong>the American people are gonna eat this up</strong>. . . . He accused Obama of running the shadow government. He accused Hillary Clinton and George Soros of being the people paying for people to show up and protest things. He held nothing back!<strong> He ridiculed Hillary Clinton for being in part of a deal that gave up 20% of our uranium supply and for having that cheap little red reset button when she became secretary of state</strong>. And each time he mentions Obama. He mentions&hellip; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;shadow government&rdquo; but he said, &ldquo;Our opponents are doing what they can.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>He called all of this fake news. He was on spot with all this. You know, it&rsquo;s hard to say. You get caught up in the moment. <strong>But this was one of the most effective press conferences I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I was listening on earbuds and I couldn't stop laughing. People probably thought I'd lost my mind. Trump delivered all my angry tweets from last night with humor and good cheer! As if showing me how it's done. <strong>It was absolutely <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/02/best-presser-ever-trump-lectures-press-says-cnn-full-anger-hate-video/">the greatest political press conference in history</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Expect to see a lot of reporters' heads explode in the next 48 hours. He destroyed the crooked media. He destroyed Obama's shadow government. He destroyed the criminal intel leakers. He destroyed his critics like no one has done before. He did with a smile. Even the corrupt Washington Post noted "<strong>he became more fiery and animated &mdash; joyful, even &mdash;</strong> <strong>when he began to banter and joust with the assembled reporters</strong>."</p>
<p>And he did it all by being himself. For 78 minutes, he showed the country what it missed if it missed his campaign.</p>
<p>I've never been prouder of a vote in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
