  content: All that the Congress is proving to the American people is how unnecessary
    they are to the business of running the country. They haven't done a days work
    since the session began and NOBODY out here is worried about the Russians. Keep
    it up and you'll be history. Drug test the Congress. Useless bastards.

  content: Once again, you've hit the nail (in this case McCaskill) on the head.  Oh
    by the way, I tweeted the "resign for lying."

<p>You had to laugh. Claire McCaskill jumped on Twitter to announce she'd never met the Russian ambassador to the US. Before that, she jumped on Twitter to brag about being so damned important and vital that the Russian ambassador sought her oracle-like guidance.</p>
<p>After people mocked and scorned her silly lie, Claire McCaskill made up more lies to cover the first lie. You know, like a liar.</p>
<p>Senator McCaskill believes Jeff Sessions should resign for not telling a lie. Which is consistent in a perverted McCaskil sort of way.</p>
<p><strong>I call on Senator McCaskill to resign</strong>. I also call on Jack Dorsey to shadow ban @clairecmc.</p>
<p>If you want Claire McCaskill to resign, <strong>click the box below</strong>.</p>
<p>[Tweet "I'm with @whennessy. Senator @Clairecmc McCaskell must resign for lying. "]</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I smell an open Dem Senate seat.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot.</p>
<p>If you're going to lie on Twitter, delete the tweets that expose your lie BEFORE tweeting the lie. It's just good lying.</p>
