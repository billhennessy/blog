<p><strong>Q. Why are we having the rallies?</strong></p>
<p>A. We are organizing the rallies so the grassroots everyday citizens can show support for President Trump and his &ldquo;Contract with the American Voter&rdquo; to &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; in a positive, upbeat manner.<br />
We want to show Americans and the world why we support President Trump and that the vast majority of Americans who voted for him want to get on with our nation&rsquo;s business influence public opinion in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What can I expect at the rallies</strong>?</p>
<p>A. You can expect to find like-minded fellow citizens who share our core conservative values. You can expect to hear our National Anthem. You can expect to hear informed and inspiring speakers. And you can expect to find diversity at the rallies; Main Street Patriots is non-partisan.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can I bring signs to the rallies</strong>?</p>
<p>A. Signs that support President Trump&rsquo;s agenda for America in a positive manner are encouraged. You would need to check with the rally organizer(s) to make sure signs are allowed in compliance with local ordinances.</p>
