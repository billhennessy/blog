<p>In 2012, Barack Obama got caught telling Russian Prime Minister Medvedev that he'd have more "flexibility" after the election.</p>
<p>Later in 2012, during a debate, Obama accused GOP candidate Mitt Romney of stoking Cold War fears against our new friends in Moscow. &nbsp;Obama said,&nbsp;&ldquo;The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because&hellip;t<strong>he Cold War&rsquo;s been over for 20 years!</strong>&rdquo; In fact, in 2012, the whole <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/07/25/5-times-liberals-mocked-mitt-romney-for-warning-about-russia/">pantheon of pantsuit </a>partiers<a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/07/25/5-times-liberals-mocked-mitt-romney-for-warning-about-russia/"> mocked warnings about Russia</a>.</p>
<p>Now, of course, Obama won't be satisfied until Trump goes to condition 1SQ for strategic launch (spin up all missiles) against the Russians. Warmongers.</p>
<p>Democrats everywhere scream <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/03/the-russians-are-coming-the-russians-are-coming/">"The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"</a></p>
<p>Funny.</p>
