<p><strong>You can actually FEEL America getting GREAT again!</strong></p>
<p>ADP payroll report shows President Trump made a big down payment on his promise to be the <strong>greatest jobs president ever.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The economy added nearly 300,000 new jobs last month. Economists expected a rise of 190,000. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-08/trump-effect-adp-employment-surges-near-most-6-years-record-goods-producing-job-gain">It was the biggest jump in jobs in 6 years.</a></p>
<p>The jobs were the good kind of jobs Trump talks about: manufacturing, mining. <strong>Jobs with grit</strong>. Not a lot of waitresses and bartenders.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/08/private-sector-jobs-february-2017-adp.html">CNBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Companies added jobs at a blistering pace in February, with<strong> a notable shift away from the service-sector positions that have dominated hiring for years, according to a report Wednesday.</strong></p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>In addition to the <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>manufacturing</strong> positions, <strong>mining</strong> and <strong>natural resources</strong> also contributed 8,000 to the total. Trump has promised to restore mining jobs as well.</p>
<p><strong>The year is off to a sizzling start for job creation</strong>, according to the ADP counts. January added 261,000 positions, a number that was revised upward from the originally reported 246,000.</p>
<p><strong>"Confidence is playing a large role</strong>," Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CNBC. "Businesses are anticipating a lot of good stuff &mdash; tax cuts, less regulation. They are hiring more aggressively."</p></blockquote>
<p>When people have to choose between one of many great jobs or many great, fulfilling careers, a lot of the trivial issues will disappear. But for today, let's just say "Thank you, President Trump."</p>
