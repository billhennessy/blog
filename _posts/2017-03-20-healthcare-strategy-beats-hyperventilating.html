  content: As a veteran we in the military are trained to strategize always in backward
    planning, all of what you point out here is 100% accurate in that point, however,
    backward planning will show us all that Ryans plan is NOT what is needed to meet
    our end goal or outcome.  Repealing it, completely is foundational to the world&rsquo;s
    best health care system that ordinary Americans can afford.

    Gregg,

    You're right. Ryan's plan won't achieve our end. So, either he is a terrible strategist or he has a different end. Like running for President in 2020.

<p>Paul Ryan unveiled a health care bill two weeks ago. Ryan's favorite lobbyists wrote it. They wrote it in secret. They dumped it on the House GOP caucus.</p>
<p>A lot of my friends on the right went <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hermatile">hermatile</a>. "Shoved down our throats!" "Obamacare two-point-oh!" "Obamacare Lite!" "Tyranny!" "Entitlements!" "Worse than Obamacare!" The most frequently used key on the keyboards of tea partiers was the exclamation point!</p>
<p>It's easy to get spun up over the way Speaker Ryan handled the bill. He violated several of his own promises. He acted a lot like Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>No one should be surprised by Ryan's behavior, though. Paul Ryan works for big corporations. He does their bidding.</p>
<p>Or maybe he's a master strategist.</p>
<p>I want you to keep in mind two important things about replacing Obamacare:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Tactics</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the hyperventilation from the right this week was unstrategic and anti-tactical. This post will fix that. If you follow it.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>You can't be strategic if you don't know what strategy is. Most people have no idea from strategy. The people who say "strategy" &nbsp;a lot in business meetings understand it the least. So let's begin with the simplest, most brilliant explanation of strategy every written.</p>
<p>John Braddock was a research fellow at Washington University. He worked with Murray Wiedenbaum. Then he quit academia and became a CIA agent. He wrote a great about thinking like a spy: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XZCYHRW">The Spy's Guide to Thinking</a>. If you haven't read it yet, you're lucky to survive. If you go up against someone who has read it, they'll eat your lunch.</p>
<p>[The Spy's Guide to Thinking is <a href="http://amzn.to/2nB155F">the #1 Best-Seller on Kindle Singles</a>]</p>
<p>Braddock is working on his second book: The Spy's Guide to Strategy. He's released some excerpts from strategy book, and one of those excerpts provides <a href="https://www.spysguide.com/single-post/2016/12/28/The-First-Step-Of-Strategy"><strong>the best definition of strategy ever</strong></a>.</p>
