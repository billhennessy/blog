  content: "Every 15 or so years medical professionals, armed with the latest research,
    reverse the dietary recommendations.\n1974, saccharin was the demonized product.
    1980's it was red meat, eggs, and butter. Those of us old enough, know the government
    recommendations are as reliable as global warming stats. The result of 1980's
    guidelines was fake food loaded with trans fat. More dangerous than Burges Meridith's
    bacon diet.\nMore reason not to trust government.\n\nYou might enjoy this\nDoctorYourself.com:

<p>Yesterday, I established an end: <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/20/healthcare-strategy-beats-hyperventilating/">great health care that ordinary people can afford</a>.</p>
<p>You remember I talked about <a href="https://www.spysguide.com/single-post/2016/12/28/The-First-Step-Of-Strategy">John Braddock's explanation of strategy</a>: choose the end and work backward. Then forword.</p>
<p>And Braddock's first step after choosing an end: what comes immediately before. That's where we are today.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, I wrote several posts about diet (<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/08/government-diet-makes-you-fat-and-kills-you/">here</a> and <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/05/why-are-you-letting-your-doctor-kill-you/">here</a>). I warned you that the government and doctors and, especially, dieticians have been poising us for years. The government's recommended diet leads to expensive diseases: type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, obesity, hip and knee damage, and many forms of cancer.</p>
<p>Some people think that deadly diet advice is on purpose. Big medicine and big government benefit when a lot of people suffer from terrible diseases. That's hard to dispute. Imagine if the incidence of all those diseases I just listed dropped in half. How many people would be thrown out of work?</p>
<p>Other people think the government and big medicine are just misguided. And afraid. I know people who know that eating egg white omelets and lots of sugars and starches will kill them. But they do it anyway because of the social stigma of eating food that actually keeps you healthy. It's possible, then, that the government and doctors are just afraid of telling you the truth. That's understandable.</p>
<p>But cowardly leaders is no excuse for us. We believe in personal responsibility. And we want to live long, healthy lives free from expensive diseases like diabetes and cancer.</p>
<p>While eating a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet won't guarantee freedom from bad diseases, eating the opposite diet will almost guarantee an expensive and life-limiting diagnosis for you some day.</p>
<p>So what do we find just before that end state? We find a lot of people eating right, which causes a huge drop in bad diagnoses. (Did you know you can reverse type 2 diabetes (video below) and arrest the progression of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2367001/">Parkinson's Disease</a> with a low-carb, high-fat diet and fasting?)</p>
<p>Eating right a strategy. And it's completely in your control. Watch.</p>
