<p>President Trump is teaching the world a huge lesson. That valuable lesson goes something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Don't be needy.</strong></p>
<p>Jim Camp is a world-famous negotiation coach. Jim has led some enormous negotiations: labor disputes, huge multi-national buys, and mergers. <a href="http://amzn.to/2neH3L7">This is is what Jim says about neediness in his book&nbsp;<em>Start With No</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is absolutely imperative that you as a negotiator understand the importance of this point. You do NOT need this deal, because<strong> to be needy is to lose control and make bad decisions</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, I pointed out that most politicians, especially Republican politicians,&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;every deal. And <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/23/obamacare-repeal-vote-results-prediction/">they use time to get "some deal done." They delay.</a> They move deadlines (which were never really deadlines.) They change positions.</p>
<p><strong>To politicians, &nbsp;any deal is better than no deal.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Republicans need to get any deal done leads to disasters. Big-league negotiators know this.</p>
<p>I've written many times about <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/15/why-compromise-is-like-half-a-boob-job/">Chris Voss.</a> Chris was the FBI's lead hostage negotiator for years. Chris is also a big fan of Jim Camp's methods. Here's what Chris says about neediness in his great book&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2neKrFQ"><em>Never Split the Difference</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>NO NEEDINESS: HAVING THE READY-TO-WALK MINDSET</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve said previously that&nbsp;<strong>no deal is better than a bad deal</strong>. If you feel you can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;No&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ve taken yourself hostage. Once you&rsquo;re clear on what your bottom line is, you have to be willing to walk away.&nbsp;<strong>Never be needy for a deal.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>To Donald Trump, no deal beats a bad deal.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Trump told Congress to vote on Friday. Pass or fail, he's moving on.</p>
<p>That is leadership. And it teaches a lesson. It teaches people that the days of American neediness are over. Like when Ronald Reagan fired the PATCO workers.</p>
<p>If the bill passes, we have something to celebrate. Celebrate the fact that our President isn't needy. Because the world now knows that Trump will walk away from a bad deal.</p>
<p>That's an achievement worth celebrating.</p>
