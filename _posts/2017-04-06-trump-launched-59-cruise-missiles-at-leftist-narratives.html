<blockquote>No child of God should ever suffer such horror.</p>
<p>&mdash;President Donald J. Trump</p></blockquote>
<p>The most powerful weapon in the world is narrative.</p>
<p>The most powerful weapon in the world is narrative.</p>
<p>That's another way of saying the pen is mightier than the sword.</p>
<p>The most powerful weapon in the world is narrative.</p>
<p>Tonight, President Trump blew up four narratives of the left. And he made America great again in the world.</p>
<p>First, the Hitler narrative is dead as a doornail. A few people really believed Trump was the reincarnation of Hitler. By launching a Navy cruise missile strike on Syria, Trump used US weapons to protect and defend and avenge Muslim babies. Hitler didn't do that. Humanitarians do what Trump did. Humanitarians. Trump just moved from Hitler to Mother Teresa. Narrative destroyed.</p>
<p>Second, the Russia narrative is dead as a doornail. Dead. Over. You will never hear about Russian complicity again. Trump attacked a Russian ally in living color. He punched Putin in the nose. The Russian narrative is done. Forever.</p>
<p>Third, the incompetent narrative is dead as a doornail. Incompetent people telegraph their moves. Trump shocked the entire world by bombing the hell out of a Syrian air base seemingly without warning. He knows what he's doing, and that "incompetent" narrative is now dead.</p>
<p>Fourth, the "Trump is a lightweight" narrative is dead as a doornail. Don't forget that commie Chinese dictator Xi is in Mar-a-Lago. Today, Xi was the senior statesman. Tomorrow, Trump will be the big bull in the room. Xi knows it. Trump just took the lead on the world's stage.</p>
<p>I'm not going to debate the details of Trump's action. Because details don't matter. Ever. Narratives matter, because narratives are the most powerful weapons in the world.</p>
<p>Trump just made America great again. He made us the big kids on the block, where the block is the world.</p>
<p>Geopolitics is back. Realpolitik is in. America is in&nbsp;charge. And 18 months of leftist, anti-Trump narrative is dead as a doornail. Dead as doornail.</p>
<p>What is North Korea thinking now? What is Iran thinking now?</p>
<p>Tired of winning yet?</p>
<p>P.S. Two of my children are in harm's way in the US Navy. My thanks to them for their dedication and professionalism.</p>
<p>UPDATE: This image and message will sink deeply into the American psyche></p>

<p>New York Times emphasizes the same Trump pull quote as I did:</p>
