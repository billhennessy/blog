<p>Hey William,</p>
<p>My name's Chase. I run the world's highest traffic men's dating advice website (www.girlschase.com), and I'm the author of a new book on the Amazon marketplace on texting.</p>
<p>I had a guy look for reviewers of other books in the "man space", and he found a review by you and your contact info. So I'm dropping you a quick line to let you know about my brand new book.</p>
<p>It's on texting girls, and it uses a method I've taught guys for years. This method makes it easy to get girls on dates, get girls texting again who've stopped responding, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>The book's on a "Kindle Countdown" where it's only 99 cents for the next day. If you could use more dates (or easier text conversations), please check it out:</p>
<p>https://www.amazon.com/How-Text-Girl-Girls-Guides-ebook/dp/B06WD38BRP/</p>
<p>If you grab the book and enjoy it, please leave a review - I'll be in your debt!</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Chase Amante<br />
