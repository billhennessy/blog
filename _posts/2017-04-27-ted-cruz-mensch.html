<p>If you read my blog, you know I've had differences with Senator Ted Cruz. But the Senator has stepped up. Bigly! Only a gentleman would do what Cruz just did with his El Chapo bill.</p>
<p>Remember the GOP race? Cruz and Trump went at each other like nobody's business. Wives and all. While Cruz couldn't bring himself to endorse Trump at the convention, Ted has stepped up a lot since the election.</p>
<p>The biggest step-up to date: this El Chapo bill. Via <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/04/25/ted-cruz-calls-14-billion-seized-el-chapo-fund-border-wall/">Breitbart News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a bill calling for the use of $14 billion seized from cartel drug lord Joaquin &ldquo;El Chapo&rdquo; Guzman to be used to pay for the President&rsquo;s border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump's most prominent issue in the campaign starting June 2015 was the Wall. You remember the rallies, don't you? "And who's going to pay for that big, beautiful wall?"</p>
<p>M E X I C O!!!!</p>
<p>Senator Cruz has no reason to help Trump solve his number one issue. None. No one would think less of Ted Cruz if he continued to pursue his personal goals, paying no attention to President Trump's agenda.</p>
<p>But Senator Cruz has gone total mensch. He's taken it upon himself to find a way for Mexico to pay for the Wall. A solution NO ONE can possibly object to. Making a Mexican drug lord pay for it.</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>My hat is off to Senator Cruz. Now, if we can get some Missouri NeverTrump Republicans to step up and put America before their own egos.</p>
