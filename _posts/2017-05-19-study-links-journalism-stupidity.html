    Where do I start?
    Ever watched "Unforgiven"? A perfect example of how news travels fast and changes with every telling. People react to the emotional impact of inaccuracies they perceive to be true.
    MSM is not inclined to be accurate. Like the tabloid, they bait with the juicy headline. Btw, tabloids tend to be more accurate.
    Enter the independent journalists. 60 Minutes has a fakenews segment featuring Mike Cernovich. 24 hours later Cernovich breaks the lead story in the nation. Breitbart, Drudge, and Hoft have similar stories. This is why MSM heads spin like Linda Blair. The emotion bait headlines they spew are immediately shot down by amateurs.

    Thinking on our feet. The bait is there for us too. Beware, do not be manipulated into fighting on the fakenews battlefield. Maddow tax returns, Russian hookers, Memogate are classic Alinsky. We are supposed to feel isolated, and anxious.

    Writing this helped me refocus. I feel better now.

<p>From the "we could have told you that" department:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Journalists' brains show a lower-than-average level of executive functioning</strong>, according to a new study, which means they have a below-average ability to regulate their emotions, suppress biases, solve complex problems, switch between tasks, and show creative and flexible thinking. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>It's okay to laugh. You suspected that reporters are kind of dumb. Now you know. They can't keep up with Trump, but they probably can't keep up with a young adult novella, either.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/journalists-brains-function-at-a-lower-level-than-average-2017-5">Business Insider story</a> gets even better:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The results showed that journalists' brains were operating at a lower level than the average population, particularly because of dehydration and the tendency of journalists to self-medicate with alcohol, caffeine, and high-sugar foods.</strong> [emphasis original]</p></blockquote>
<p>The next time you're tempted to get mad a journalist, don't. Instead, feel the kind of pity one feels for the ignorance of animals.</p>
