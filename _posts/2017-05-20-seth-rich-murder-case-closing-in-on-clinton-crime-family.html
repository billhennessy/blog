<p>Was Seth Rich murdered as an example?</p>
<p>Seth Rich was murdered. Two gunshots to his back. Like you'd see on The Sopranos (<a href="https://youtu.be/fc5QWxQ_leI">video</a>). The police called it a robbery. But nothing was stolen. Not his cell phone. Not his wallet. Not his watch. Not his cash.</p>
<p>Shortly after his murder, Wikileaks posted embarrassing emails. Emails from the Democratic National Committee's email server. Wikileaks maintains that the theft of the emails was an inside job. The FBI, the DNC, and others say the Russians did it.</p>
<p>For perspective, let's look at an email exchange between Hillary's campaign chairman John Podesta, her campaign manager Robby Mook, and Joel Benenson.</p>
<blockquote><p>On Feb 22, 2015, at 5:56 PM, Joel Benenson &nbsp;wrote:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I think we have to make examples now of people who have violated the trust of HRC and the rest of the team. <strong>People going forward need to know there are stiff consequences for leaking</strong>, self-promotion, unauthorized talking with the press. No one &ndash; literally no one talked to the press in either Obama campaign without clearing it with campaign brass.</p></blockquote>
<p>John Podesta replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Sun, Feb 22, 2015 at 6:12 PM, John Podesta &nbsp;wrote:</p>
<p>Agree. Happy to talk to the David's. Call me crazy, but I think if we can survive the next month, it will be possible, maybe even straightforward to get our arms around this once there is an actual campaign.<strong> <span class="efm-hi">I'm definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it.</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So, Podesta was down with making an example of a suspected leaker, even without evidence or proof of a leak. Sort of like a mafia boss, right?</p>
<p>And Mook was all for it, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="email-content"><span class="efm-parent">I agree--when we have press staff, this will be MUCH easier. And <strong>I would love an example being made.</strong></span></div>

<div class="email-content"></div>
<div class="email-content">Kim Dotcom revealed today that he helped Seth Rich transfer those DNC emails to Wikileaks. Via <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/05/boom-hacker-kim-dotcom-knew-seth-rich-wikileaks-source-involved/">The Gateway Pundit</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="email-content" style="text-align: left;">Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were <a href="https://twitter.com/etsisusi/status/753639472365903873">pursuing a &ldquo;lead&rdquo;</a> saying that Rich was en route to the FBI the morning of his murder, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an <strong>&ldquo;ongoing court case&rdquo; possibly involving the Clinton family.</strong></div>

<p>Later, Dotcom announced he will release details on Tuesday, after conferring with his lawyers on Monday.</p>
<p>The Seth Rich murder weapon inches ever closer to John Podesta's trigger finger. It looks more an more like the whole Russian conspiracy theory was an elaborate cover to hide a DNC or Hillary hit job on Seth Rich.</p>
