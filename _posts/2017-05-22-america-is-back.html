<p>On the night that a deranged terrorist murdered and maimed little girls in Manchester England, we can take some solace in the fact that the greatest bastion of Western Civilization is back.</p>
<p>America is back.</p>
<p>Back on the watch.</p>
<p>Back on the hunt.</p>
<p>Back in the world.</p>
<p>When President Trump became the first American president to speak in Saudi Arabia, he delivered a message beyond his words. He delivered a message that no one missed. He delivered a message that terrorists' bombs cannot drown out. He delivered a message that diminished his predecessor's harmful follies.</p>
<p>Donald Trump gave the Islamic world a simple message. A mission. A duty. Donald Trump gave the Islamic world a recipe for respectability. He told them to police their own insane terrorists. And he told them how to do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Drive. Them. Out.</p>
<p>Drive them out of your places of worship.</p>
<p>Drive them out of your communities.</p>
<p>Drive them out of your holy land, and</p>
<p>Drive them out of his Earth!</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump's raw leadership cast a dark shadow across the weakness and cowardice of his bumbling predecessor, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Everything about Barack Obama whined, "blame America." His stooped figure said, "blame America." His obsequious bow said, "blame America." His effeminate&nbsp;handshake&nbsp;said, "blame America."</p>
<p>But the world doesn't want an America to blame.</p>
<p>The world craves an America to&nbsp;love. An America to envy. An America to complain about. But an America to mimic.</p>
<p>The world remembers when Nazis and Emporers threatened the planet. And America put them down.</p>
<p>The world remembers when a Soviet menace threatened her most vulnerable nations. And America tore down its wall.</p>
<p>The world begs for American leadership, American ingenuity, and American courage.</p>
<p>Donald Trump went to Riyadh.</p>
<p>Donald Trump flew to Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Donald Trump became the first US president to touch the Western Wall.</p>
<p>Donald Trump will complete the Great Religion circuit by visiting Vatican City.</p>
<p>Donald Trump restored the world's hope. Hope in a shining city on a hill. Hope in civilization and decency. Hope in the goodness of humanity. Hope for world peace. Hope for America's future.</p>
<p>While small men and women wring their little hands over tiny matters in Washington, DC, the world waves its hands in hope that America is back.</p>
<p>America is back.</p>
<p>God comfort Manchester's' survivors. God heal the wounded. God receive the dead in paradise. God bless Manchester and the UK. God save the queen.</p>
<p>And God bless the United States of America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
