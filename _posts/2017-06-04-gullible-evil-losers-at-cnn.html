<p>Maybe we should consider CNN employees enemy combatants.</p>
<p>CNN's latest hate-crime: <strong>CNN is criticizing London police for using too many bullets.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>That's right. CNN will soon demand a UN war crimes tribunal to try, convict, and hang the London cops who put down the London Bridge terrorists.</p>

<p><strong>CNN has not responded to my request for comments</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically, I asked CNN to provide the exact number of rounds police are allowed to use to stop a terrorist.</p>
<p>While we wait for Jeff Zucker's precise bullet limit, I'll supply my own:<strong> police should stop shooting terrorists when their last magazine is empty.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>UPDATE: CNN has removed this ridiculous story from the top of their home page.</p>
