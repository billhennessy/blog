<p>Scott Adams pointed out the linguistic brilliance of Donald Trump's perfect summation of James Comey's failed takedown attempt.</p>
<p>"No obstruction. No collusion. He's a leaker."</p>
<p>That's how Trump summarized Comey's testimony to the Senate's Russian Conspiracy Hoax Committee.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.periscope.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1dRJZAeZryXGB?t=3s"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22125 size-full" src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-09-18.57.19.png" alt="" width="600" height="203" /></a></p>
<p>Scott is a genius in persuasion and psychology. Everything he just said about Trump's linguistic kill-shot is dead-on accurate. Trump destroyed Comey without firing a shot. "No obstruction. No collusion. He's a leaker."</p>
<p>Comey is a lawyer with a limited vocabulary. Trump has the best words. We just saw the two of them side-by-side, and Trump destroyed his rival.</p>
<p>I predict Comey will plead guilty before Christmas to avoid time in prison. You can mock me if I'm wrong. But wait until December 26 just so you don't look foolish.</p>
<p>Comey's crime? He freely admitted it under oath yesterday. Robert Mueller will expand his investigation to cover this crime soon.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Trump's lawyer filing<a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/report-trumps-lawyer-file-complaint-doj-comey-leak/"> DOJ IG complaint against Comey</a>. The IG will forward the complaint to Robert Mueller. My prediction is already coming true.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2: I bought 100 shares of YES on PredictIt. <a href="https://www.predictit.org/Contract/6876/Will-a-federal-criminal-charge-be-filed-against-James-Comey-in-2017#data">You can, too</a>.</p>
