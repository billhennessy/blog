<p>To liberals, the murder of a Republican is like the swatting of a mosquito. They oppose violence in theory, but they also want the pest dead. <strong>They're just too lazy to get out of their easy chairs to do it themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Cass Sunstein, a leftist who's happy whenever a conservative dies early, wrote a book called Nudge. It's a good psychology book. Nudge is about persuasion, which is my chief interest. Sunstein teaches people how to get others to swat mosquitoes for us.</p>
<p>The mainstream media revere&nbsp;Sunstein. The right hates Sunstein. The left applies Sunstein's science to manipulate people from a distance. Like swatting mosquitoes without leaving your easy chair. Conservatives, on the other hand, pooh-pooh psychology and neuroscience. They think it's voodoo or witchery.</p>
<p>Because the leftist media like <strong>CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, and MSNBC use psychology</strong>, they can influence their fringe to attack and kill conservatives. They're very good at psychology.</p>
<p>Today, we saw a fringe leftist shoot at 30 Republican members of Congress and their staffers. It happened on a baseball field in Virginia. The shooter was a 66-year-old man from Belleville, Illinois. His name was James T. Hodgkinson. <strong>Hodgkinson was radicalized by the mainstream media.</strong> And I think <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/06/14/scalise-shooter-dead-gunman-idd-as-trump-hating-building-inspector-from-illinois.html">they radicalized him on purpose</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1RDGlZqrLyDxL?t=0">Scott Adams explain his brilliant "radicalized" meme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The media actually celebrated Hodgkinson's attack</strong> on the unarmed Republicans, until they tried to erase the incident with a lie. For example, <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/writer-wapo-attempts-justify-shooting-elected-representatives-radicalleft/">The Gateway Pundit noticed</a> that a Washington Post reporter justified the shooting on Twitter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="wp-image-22144 size-full aligncenter" src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-14-19.30.23.png" alt="" width="507" height="190" /></p>
<p>Cass Sunstein would be proud. Sunstein probably shot (no pun) Harris a note congratulating him on great persuasion technique. <strong>Malcolm Harris radicalized the next James T. Hodgkinson</strong>.</p>
<p>Earlier, <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/founder-left-wing-vox-congressman-shot-republicans-getting-want/">The Gateway Pundit pointed out how Daily Kos</a> founder Markos Moulitsas programmed his minions to believe Republican deserve to be shot.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22145" src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-14-19.33.14.png" alt="" width="521" height="198" /></p>
<p>Finally, as I predicted at about 1:00 this afternoon, the Washington Post invented five unnamed, anonymous sources to smear Trump and knock <strong>the radicalized James T. Hodgkinson</strong> off the front page. WaPo posted a mostly fabricated story about Robert Mueller shifting his investigation from Russian election tampering to obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>That's another Sunstein move: <strong>waving shiny objects to distract the gullible</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm not that gullible. I know their game because it's a game I study and play in a different way.</p>
<p>Unlike Washington Post and the left's mainstream murder advocates, <strong>I use persuasion to help get what they want.</strong> Like a personal trainer. But the techniques are the same whether they're used for good or evil.</p>
<p>The left uses psychology for manipulation, <strong>to radicalize its fringe.</strong></p>
<p>Just thought you should know.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like when the MSM succeeds in radicalizing leftists.</p>

<p>Mark Steyn explains just how vile and hateful the left has become.</p>
