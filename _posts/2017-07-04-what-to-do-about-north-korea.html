  content: "I have long said China can be leveraged into dealing with Kim Jong Un.
    China stands to lose more from us than North Korea. American manufacturing propelled
    the Chinese economy, N. Korea provides nothing.\nIf history teaches anything it
    is that totalitarian leadership is never as stable as it appears. It it always
    vulnerable to internal overthrow. There are always coup attempts, \nI believe
    the details of a Chinese intervention are currently being ironed out. \nPassing
    away in his sleep, car accident, plane crash. I foresee a bloodless coup and sudden
    change of power structure that all occurs within a 24 hour period. Kim Jong Un
    and his advisors gone, and a short leash on whoever replaces him."

<p>If you think about geopolitics at all, you know North Korea poses many problems for its neighbors. And for the United States. And for the whole world.</p>
<p>If we take attack North Korea militarily, over a million South Koreans will die. Along with a lot of Americans on ships and on land over there. Nobody wants that. It might come to that, but nobody wants it.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/07/04/north-korea-claims-to-have-test-launched-its-first-icbm.html">North Korea has ICBMs that can drop a nuke on Alaska</a>. Or Hawaii. Soon they'll be able to hit California.</p>
<p>Here is my two-pronged approach:</p>
<h3>1. 500% Tariffs</h3>
<p><strong>Impose a 500% tariff on all imports from any country that maintains trade relations of any kind with North Korea.</strong></p>
<p>Many countries, including China, continue to trade with North Korea. A blanket 500% tax on imports would hurt us, sure. But it would cripple China's weak economy. China, and all other nations doing business with Kim, would have to sever ties immediately. And if they don't, well, <strong>that giant sucking sound you hear will be manufacturing plants opening up all across the fruited plane</strong>.</p>
<p>China takes only one thing seriously: money. Threaten their money supply and Xi will finally man up and take down Li'l Kim.</p>
<p>But that tariff needs some spine. A spine that will <strong>put the fear of Trump into every world leader</strong>.</p>
<h3>2. Declare War</h3>
<p><strong>Congress declares that a state of war exists between the Government of North Korea and the Government and the people of the United States of America.</strong></p>
<p>Being in a state of declared war does not require combat. But if Congress passes a war declaration, the world knows the president can initiate combat any time the mood strikes. <strong>With a single tweet, he can order our armed forces to wipe North Korea off the face of the earth</strong>.</p>
<p>People will pay attention to that. Kim will know that his life is in the hands of Donald J. Trump's next tweet. China will know. Japan will know. South Korea will know. And Russia will know.</p>
<p>In plain English, the declaration of war is justified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Korea's leaders have repeatedly said <strong>they intend to use nuclear weapons</strong> to blackmail or attack the people of United States.</li>
<li>North Korea's leaders have <strong>violated every UN mandate intended</strong> to stop North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and intercontinental delivery abilities.</li>
<li>North Korea has now the means, the motive, and the opportunity <strong>to attack the people of the United States with nuclear weapons</strong>.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is our right as human beings and our duty as a government to adopt <strong>this unanimous declaration of war</strong> between North Korea and the United States.</li>
<li>This declaration will remain in effect until altered or abolished by Congress.</li>
<li>May God have mercy on their communist souls.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get Serious</h3>
<p>It's time to get serious. Ever since Jimmy Carter flew to Pyongyang to bring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung">Kim Il-sung</a> a batch of Miss Lilly's secret peanut brittle, the North Korea has marched relentlessly toward total war against the United States.</p>
<p>Through three administrations, the United States threatened, appeased, cajoled, and looked the other way.</p>
<p>As President Trump said, <strong>the time for strategic patience with North Korea is over.&nbsp;</strong>Nothing will be gained by waiting until Kim wipes out millions of Americans as they sleep in bed. Nor do we gain by giving into his terroristic blackmail.</p>
<p>On this Independence Day, it's time to declare independence from the fear and intimidation that puts the entire world at risk. It's time declare economic and military war against North Korea and her greedy enablers.</p>
<p>The two actions, taken in tandem, will likely prevent war. It's a bold move, but it's necessary. Millions of American lives depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Fourth.</strong></p>
<p>God bless the brave heroes of our armed forces, especially those serving with my sons in the Pacific Theater.</p>
