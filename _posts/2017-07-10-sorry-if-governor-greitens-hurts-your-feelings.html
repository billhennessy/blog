  content: Hey, I've an idea. Get the dumbass politicians to abolish state income,
    federal income, medicare, and social security tax from minimum wage earners. They'll
    get 8% or so of it back in sales tax that will go to the local and state economy.
    I wonder when m.wage earners will ask for wages in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies
    .

<p>Kudos to Governor Greitens and the Missouri legislature. They killed a minimum wage law in St. Louis. The law &nbsp;was&nbsp;designed to make city politicians feel better about themselves. It's certain result would have been fewer jobs for the people who need jobs the most.</p>
<p>Why are you complaining about Governor Greitens' first term? Did you not read his books?</p>
<p>Like Donald Trump, <strong>Eric Greitens called his plays at the line of scrimmage</strong>. He told you how he would govern. In his book&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resilience-Hard-Won-Wisdom-Living-Better/dp/054432398X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1499690940&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resilience: Hard-won Wisdom for Living a Better Life</a>,&nbsp;</em>Gov. Greitens introduces us to Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that focuses on how to live with purpose, character, dignity, and honor.</p>
<p>In his prior book,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Fist-education-humanitarian-making/dp/054742485X/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=054742485X&amp;pd_rd_r=1CXXYH03KW4VPBJNT2A4&amp;pd_rd_w=18ioG&amp;pd_rd_wg=8Khn3&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=1CXXYH03KW4VPBJNT2A4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL</a></em>, the governor introduces us to the seemingly novel idea that the results of one's actions, not the feelings of the actor, are what matter most in policy and in life.</p>
<p>Now, as governor of Missouri, Greitens is taking flak for supporting a state law that prevents cities like St. Louis from enacting a minimum wage law that would kill jobs for the poor while making the board of aldermen feel better about themselves.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, last year St. Louis raised the minimum wage. Just like Seattle. The so-called "living wage" movement was all the rage among the left.</p>
<p>But the "living wage" hurts the poor. It only makes politicians and leftist professors feel good about themselves. We know this. Seattle's $15 minimum wage is killing the poor.</p>
<p>From the Washington Post story,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/26/new-study-casts-doubt-on-whether-a-15-minimum-wage-really-helps-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A &lsquo;very credible&rsquo; new study on Seattle&rsquo;s $15 minimum wage has bad news for liberals:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The costs to low-wage workers in Seattle outweighed the benefits by a ratio of&nbsp;three to one, according to the study, conducted by a group of economists at the University of Washington who were commissioned by the city.</p></blockquote>
<p>People who make $400 a month can't afford to lose a penny. Yet laws like the one St. Louis politicians enacted cost the working poor $125 a month in Seattle.</p>
<p>From the Washington Post story,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/26/new-study-casts-doubt-on-whether-a-15-minimum-wage-really-helps-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A &lsquo;very credible&rsquo; new study on Seattle&rsquo;s $15 minimum wage has bad news for liberals</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the whole, the study estimates, the average <strong>low-wage worker in the city lost $125 a month</strong> because of the hike in the minimum.</p></blockquote>
<p>Governor Greitens wrote about the UN's failed attempts to protect orphans in Bosnia in The Heart and the Fist. Greitens witnessed the failed "do-gooderism" first hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>Later, when I thought about the UN workers in Gasinci writing their letter, when I read about what had happened at Srebrenica, I realized that there was a great dividing line between all of the speeches, protests, feelings, empathy, good wishes, and words in the world, and the one thing that mattered most: protecting people through the use of force or threat of force. In situations like this, <strong>good intentions and heartfelt wishes were not enough. The great dividing line between words and results was courageous action.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Greitens, Eric. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Fist-education-humanitarian-making/dp/054742485X/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=054742485X&amp;pd_rd_r=1CXXYH03KW4VPBJNT2A4&amp;pd_rd_w=18ioG&amp;pd_rd_wg=8Khn3&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=1CXXYH03KW4VPBJNT2A4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Heart and the Fist: The education of a humanitarian, the making of a Navy SEAL </a>(p. 58). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.</p>
<p>Good intentions and heartfelt wishes by the UN experts resulted in the orphans getting raped and killed in, what amounted to, UN concentration camps. These camps became playgrounds for pederasts.</p>
<p>Good intentions can kill.</p>
<p>Courageous action sometimes requires that <strong>leaders say "no" to the do-gooders</strong>. Do-gooders like the St. Louis Board of Aldermen. Do-gooders who would steal 30% of a poor woman's income in order to feel better about themselves.</p>
<p><strong>I applaud Governor Greitens and Missouri's legislature for having the courage to kill a St. Louis law that hurt the poor.</strong> And I'm proud I have my Greitens for Governor Day One team shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri chose well when we chose Eric Greitens for Governor</strong>.</p>
