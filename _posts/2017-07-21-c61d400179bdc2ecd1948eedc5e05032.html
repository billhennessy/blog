<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>I'm a two-time Amazon bestselling author, and I'm reaching out to you because you left a review on Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.</p>
<p>I recently helped a good friend of mine who is an expat tax accountant release his first book, U.S. Taxes for Worldly Americans: The Traveling Expat's Guide to Living, Working, and Staying Tax Compliant Abroad, on Amazon (http://amzn.to/2j3nuBM). I also had the privilege of writing the foreword to the book due to my own travel experience.The book explains the nuances of legally minimizing your taxes as a traveler or expatriate, and some valuable lifestyle tips. </p>
<p>In order to boost the book's visibility on Amazon, it's very important that we increase the number of reviews. We are currently at 40 reviews with a 5-star average rating and trying to get up to 50 to qualify for a promotion. </p>
<p>Would it be alright if I sent you a complimentary copy in exchange for your honest review when you are done? I can send it as an epub, mobi, pdf, or even audio mp3 if you prefer.</p>
<p>No hard feelings if you are too busy or not interested!</p>
