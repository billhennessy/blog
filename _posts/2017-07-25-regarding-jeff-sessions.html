<p>I campaigned for and voted for Donald Trump. I stand 100% behind Trump today.</p>
<p>I support Trump because he's a fighter. He's a man of action. Trump prosecutes his causes, he doesn't navel gaze.</p>
<p>Jeff Sessions is a good man. He's a good Washington man. He has standards of decorum. Standards I admire.</p>
<p>Trump has no standards of decorum. But I voted for Trump because history has made decorum a liability, even a vice. Decorum accomplishes much in times of relative harmony. Decorum opens to the door to destruction in times like these.</p>
<p>If Trump wants Sessions, I'm for Sessions.</p>
<p>If Trump wants someone else, I trust Trump's judgment.</p>
<p>Just my opinion. I could be wrong. But if you think harder about this than I do, you're navel gazing.</p>
