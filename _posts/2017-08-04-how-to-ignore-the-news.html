<p>"Will Trump survive this?"</p>
<p>A friend of mine texted me yesterday. I had no idea what the "this" was. Later, I learned.</p>
<p>Turns out, like most of the media's breathless revelations about Trump's supposed crimes, the story that people reacted to meant little. The anti-Trump media exploded with fake news, fake interpretations of real news, and speculation that supported their own angry fetishes.</p>
<p>But any reasonable person would respond like my friend. I did, too. For a moment.</p>
<p>Then I thought about it. I applied simple Stoic thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is under my control?
<ul>
<li>My own thoughts, opinions, desires, aversions, and actions. Nothing else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do I choose to react?
<ul>
<li>By having a beer and watching a television show with my wife.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't control what Jake Tapper does. What people say and think is not in my control. So I adopted <strong>an attitude of uncurious disdain</strong> for those things. I chose to emotionally ignore them. The way I might ignore a spider I see through a window.</p>
<p>Later, I found a problem at work that I could help solve. So I took the first steps toward solving it. Or trying to. I did what I could at the moment. I wrote down some notes in my <a href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-productivity-planner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commitment notebook.</a> Then, I went to bed.</p>
<p>Today, I noticed several reports pointing out that all of yesterday's breathless reports about a grand jury were really non-news. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/04/grand-jury-bombshell-rocks-media-but-calm-down-this-is-what-prosecutors-do.html">Special counsels use grand juries all the time</a>, the way doctors use stethoscopes and plumbers use PVC pipe. If a special counsel didn't use a grand jury, he wouldn't be doing his job. A grand jury authorizes just about everything a special counsel does. It's a formality to hold those lawyers in check.</p>
<p>Non-news.</p>
<p>Non-news the anti-Trump media treated like a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/20714-yellowstone-supervolcano-eruption.html">supervolcano eruption</a> that wiped out half the population of North America. Because the anti-Trump media choose not to control the things they can control: their own&nbsp;thoughts, opinions, desires, aversions, and actions. They chose to go berserk on the air like a spoiled kid in the toy department at Target.</p>
<p>You don't have to avoid the news to live free. It helps merely to remember what's in your control and what is not in your control.</p>
<p>I can't control the media. And they can't control me. Unless I let them. The way the media let Trump manipulate their minds.</p>
