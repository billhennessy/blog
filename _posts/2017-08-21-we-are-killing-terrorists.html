<p>Elections have consequences.</p>
<p>One consequence that we've all experienced: when you elect a street fighter, you get street fights.</p>
<p>Another consequence that terrorists are experiencing: when you elect a street-fighter patriot, terrorists die.</p>
<p>President Trump tonight reminded so many of us why we elected him. Because he's a street fighter. Because he's a patriot. Because there are bad people who wish us harm, and Donald Trump is okay with killing them.</p>
<p>I am okay with killing them, too. By the scores. By the barrel. By the megaton. By any means necessary. Kill those terrorist bastards, kill them all.</p>
<p>Tonight, President Trump delivered the best speech of his life. As a veteran, this speech made me wish I could go back in. (I'm a little too old.)</p>
<p>Trump's speech was <strong>moving</strong>, <strong>inspirational</strong>, and, most shockingly, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-speech-afganistan-2017-8"><strong>humble</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I'm normally against incursions, but <strong>I'm down with this</strong>. I'm down with Trump.</p>
<p>I wasn't against incursions when I was younger. But I have two sons serving right now. One in Guam. Another in the Persian Gulf. I pray for them every day. I pray to see them again. I pray they serve well, but I know they will. I pray for the day get to take the two blue stars off my window. And never replace them with a gold one. Some might say I sort of have skin in this game.</p>
<p>Either of them could end up involved in Trump's Afghanistan strategy. But I firmly believe that this president and this cabinet can do what their predecessors failed to do. Trump and Mattis can wipe out the terrorists. So I'm down.</p>
<p>One line meant a lot to me.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23275" src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/donald-trump-1.jpg" alt="donald-trump-1.jpg" width="701" height="409" /></p>
<blockquote><p>"We are not nation building again. <strong>We are killing terrorists.</strong>"</p></blockquote>
<p>That's what it's all about.</p>
<p>Killing the fucking terrorists. Wherever they might hide.</p>
