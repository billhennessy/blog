<p>You kind of knew how the story would end. How the search for the 10 missing sailors would end.</p>
<p>This morning, we began hearing about bodies discovered on board the McCain and in waters near the collision. I grieve for those families.</p>
<p>The news breaks a lot of hearts. Especially the hearts of people with loved ones deployed on ships in dangerous waters.</p>
<p>I know my readers never forget the work our military does. Let's just keep it that way.</p>
<p>Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord. Let the perpetual light shine on them. May their souls and all the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace.</p>
