<p>James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton <em>three months before</em> he interviewed her.</p>
<p>James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton <em>before</em> interviewing 16 key witnesses.</p>
<p>James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton <em>before</em> he gathered any significant evidence.</p>
<p>James Comey gave Hillary Clinton permission to destroy evidence in a felony investigation.</p>
<p>James Comey leaked classified information to the media.</p>
<p>These are all facts. No one disputes them.</p>
<p>They are all crimes of various degrees. Some felonies.</p>

<p>At the time James Comey committed these crimes, he was head of the FBI.</p>
<p>Because of James Comey's felonies, the FBI probably needs to be disbanded. Shut down. Destroyed. Eliminated.</p>
<p>No one can trust anything the FBI does.</p>
<p>No one can trust anyone who works at the FBI.</p>
<p>Every FBI employee lost most of their credibility today.</p>
<p>Because of James Comey.</p>
<p>And his accessory after the fact, Robert Mueller.</p>
<p>If I were a member of Congress, I would vote against any bill that provided funding to the FBI. Any funding. I'd shit it down.</p>
<p>Once, FBI agents were my heroes. Many former FBI agents still are heroes to me.</p>
<p>But the FBI itself is a criminal organization. Like the mafia. Like a drug cartel. Like the SS. Like the KGB.</p>
<p>The FBI uses its power to destroy political opponents and to protect itself.</p>
<p>James Comey ruined the FBI. For that, every American should demand Comey's prosecution.</p>
<p>Lawyer up, Jimmy. Your days are numbered.</p>
