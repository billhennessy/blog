<p>The left is crying. One guy on twitter is nearly suicidal. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/trump-trolls-hillary-clintons-book-launch-liberals-wet/">Hoft has more</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what happened.</p>
<p>Someone posted this photo on twitter. All the sane people laughed.</p>
<p>@realDonaldTrump retweeted. And now it's the left's new Russian conspiracy.</p>
<p>I remember when all the best comedians were liberals. But the new left traded its sense of humor for baseball bats with ten penny nails.</p>
<p>USA!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pre-schoolers at CNN have their panties in a bunch because the President of the United States wore a hat emblazoned with USA.</p>
<p>Does anyone at CNN even <em>know</em> a person who managed to reach psychological adulthood? Apparently, you're required to have a pervasive developmental disorder just to apply to the network. CNN should change its letters to IEP.</p>
