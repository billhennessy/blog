  content: Letting Lois Lerner off the hook is a huge disappointment. I hope that
    Sessions shows more backbone when it comes to investigating Wassersman-Schultz
    and the Pakistani IT Mafia.

<blockquote>Eight months into the Trump Administration, one cabinet appointment stands out as a flop: Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We all had a lot of hope. Back in January. Hope.</p>
<p>Hope for the Trump administration. Hope for American greatness. And hope for justice. If you're a Tea Partier, you had a lot of hope.</p>
<p>Jeff Sessions looked like the ultimate pick for Attorney General. Conservatives berated Mitch McConnell to accelerate Sessions' confirmation by the Senate. Conservatives threatened to break with Trump when the president attacked Sessions on Twitter.</p>
<p>And yet .&nbsp;. .</p>
<p>And yet, Attorney General Sessions has done almost nothing since taking office. Not only has Sessions failed to advance the Trump agenda, he has confirmed two of the Obama administration's greatest injustices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sessions refused to investigate the criminal IRS manager Lois Lerner, the woman at the center of the IRS's attack on conservative and Tea Party groups</li>
<li>Sessions allowed the FBI and DOJ to withhold evidence of wrongdoing by James Comey in the Hillary email investigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, Sessions recused himself from the Russian witch without good cause. Sessions just wanted to appease the press. Like a typical, weak Republican Congressman.</p>
<p>Maybe Trump was right and we were wrong. Sure, Jeff Sessions' heart and head are in the right place. But after decades in Washington, Sessions appears to be another establishment guy. A cheap, empty Republican suit who recites Cato the Younger but behaves like an Army private with battle fatigue.</p>
<p>Americans elected Trump hoping for justice. We thought Sessions was the perfect leader for the Department of Justice. But Sessions looks more and more like another Republican establishment swamp swimmer.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sessions will man up and do his job. But eight months in, I've lost most of my respect for Jeff Sessions. And most of my hope for justice in the Trump administration.</p>
