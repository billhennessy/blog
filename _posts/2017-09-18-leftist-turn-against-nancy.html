<p>Nancy Pelosi is paying a price for statesmanship.</p>
<p>Remember when this blog wrote <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/08/31/who-can-stop-the-antifa-caliphate/">about liberals saving us from Antifa</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>But one group can save us from the Antifa caliphate. An unlikely group. A group you&rsquo;d never believe could be the heroes of this terrifying story.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s this group? Who will save America? Who will preserve Western Civilization? Christendom? Judaism?</p>
<p>Not the Right.</p>
<p>Not the Center.</p>
<p>Not <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2005/02/17/beware-the-man-in-the-middle-recycled/">the Great &ldquo;Undecided&rdquo; Voter</a>.</p>
<p>No, if you want to be saved, look left, young man. Look left.</p>
<p>The left can save us.</p>
<p>Not the &ldquo;leftists.&rdquo; Not the progressives. They&rsquo;re on Antifa&rsquo;s side. (Until Antifa turns on them.)</p>
<p>But liberals.</p>
<p>Our friendly liberals.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Pelosi Steps Toward the Middle</h3>
<p>The day after I wrote that post, Nancy Pelosi spoke out against Antifa's violence. Before Paul Ryan. Before Mitch McConnell. Before Jeb Bush. Before Marco Rubio. (As far as I know,&nbsp;<em>only</em> Paul Ryan has walked back his support for Antifa. Mitch, Jeb, Marco, Mitt, and McCain are still Antifa supporters.)</p>
<p>While the Republican sissies wrung their hands, <a href="http://americanlookout.com/after-getting-pressure-from-conservatives-nancy-pelosi-finally-disavows-antifa-violence/">Nancy Pelosi was busy disavowing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our democracy has no room for inciting violence or endangering the public, no matter the ideology of those who commit such acts. The violent actions of people calling themselves antifa in Berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation, and the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted.</p></blockquote>
<p>After condemning leftwing violence, Pelosi has become friendly with President Trump. She worked with the president on hurricane relief, debt ceiling, and DACA. I wrote about Trump's deals with Democrats <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/06/the-strategy-that-dare-not-speak-its-name/">here</a> and <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/17/chuck-and-nancy-and-donald-and-mitch-and-paul/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I previously warned that leftists are not liberals. Today, Nancy Pelosi learned that lesson. The hard way.</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi had to be rushed off stage for her own safety. Safety from a mob. A mob of angry leftists. Leftists angry because Nancy condemned Antifa and ate dinner with Trump.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/illegal-aliens-storm-pelosi-dream-act-presser-chanting-democrats-deport-video/">The Gateway Pundit reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nancy Pelosi was set to speak about the DREAM Act when too many angry DACA recipients surrounded her and screamed at her demanding answers on their future and claiming every illegal immigrant be protected.</p>
<p>Pelosi said,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear you don&rsquo;t want any answers. It&rsquo;s clear,&rdquo; as she was rushed out of the event to safety.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Mitch and Paul Are In Trouble</h3>
<p>My theory on Trump's deals with Democrat leaders goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trump wants to get stuff done. Stuff that makes America great again.</li>
<li>Trump is not an ideological conservative, so he has no qualms with working with Democrats to make America great.</li>
<li>Trump is sick of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the do-nothing, cowardly Republican Congress.</li>
<li>Trump cozied up to Nancy and Chuck Schumer to advance his agenda and to humiliate Ryan and McConnell. And it's working.</li>
<li>Finally, if GOP internal polls show voters support Trump's outreach to Democrats, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/17/chuck-and-nancy-and-donald-and-mitch-and-paul/">Congressional Republicans will demand that Ryan and McConnell knock off their middle-school games and get to work</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ryan and McConnell have a window. A window to return to the president's side. A window through which they can shove some important legislation like Obamacare repeal, tax reform, and infrastructure. A window to retain control of Congress.</p>
<p>But that window is closing fast.</p>
<h3>Leftists and GOP Establishment Are Pushing Trump and Pelosi Together</h3>
<p>With each leftist attack against Pelosi, she'll develop a new respect for and camaraderie with President Trump. Today, Ms. Pelosi must have felt like she was in a foxhole with The Donald.</p>
<p>Think about it. Donald Trump treats Nancy Pelosi better than her own constituents.</p>
<p>And Nancy Pelosi treats Donald Trump better than Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell treat their party's own president.</p>
<p>Psychologically, idiots on the right and violent thugs on the left are pushing Trump and Pelosi into a stronger alliance. Trump can do a lot to help Democrats in 2018.</p>
<p>What you're seeing play out in Washington is a world-class strategy master in Trump. Trump is running circles around self-serving strategic novice Ryan. And Ryan's weaknesses could really hurt the conservative agenda.</p>
<p>Watch for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to say nicer things about Trump's United Nations appearances than Ryan or McConnell say. And then expect to see Congressional Republicans head off to some posh resort for a weekend of teambuilding.</p>
<p>And remember you heard it first on Hennessy's View.</p>
