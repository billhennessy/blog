<p>They were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Those United Nations stuffed shirts were dumbfounded. Struck dumb. Silenced. Shocked. Floored.</p>
<p>Those sissy diplomats were shaken. Appalled. Frightened.</p>
<p>Never in the sordid history of the United Nations has an American president spoken in unvarnished truth in unvarnished terms.</p>
<p>Trump has the best words.</p>
<p>Trump used his best words today.</p>
<p>The best of the best.</p>
<p>Trump called Kim Jung Un "Rocket Man." The funniest and most effective linguistic kill-shot to date. A Twitter line. And Trump pulled it off at the United bygod Nations.</p>
<p>[Scott Adams can't stop laughing about Rocket Man tweet!]</p>

<p>They were shocked.</p>
<p>But it gets better. Rocket Man came AFTER Trump promised to completely destroy North Korea!</p>
<p>About damn time a US President warned the world one of its nations might go away. Like Atlantis. Poof! Gone. Adios.</p>
<p>Read our president's best words:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>The United States has great strength and patience,, but if it is forced to de fend itself or its allies,, we will have no choice but to <strong>totally destroy North Korea</strong>.. <strong>Rocket man is on a suicide mission</strong> for himself and for his regime...</p></blockquote>

<p>Boom!&nbsp;If only Reagan had spoken so bluntly to the UN.&nbsp;Folks, I'm 53 years old. I've hated the United Nations since the 1970s. I've prayed for a president who would finally reign in that rogue, globalist disaster.</p>
<p>Beautiful. Beautiful words. Beautiful speech. Wonderful.</p>
<p>Our president also got the UN socialists to applaud his takedown of socialism. Huge!</p>

<blockquote><p>The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented.. [ Applause ]</p>
<p>From the soviet union to Cuba to Venezuela, <strong>wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure</strong>. Those who preach the tenants of these discredited ideologies, only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Awesome. Ronald Reagan never tore down socialism more eloquently. And Trump spoke those words to the body that fosters and promotes socialism around the world. The wicked United Nations.</p>
<p>If that's all Trump had said, he'd have said more than any US president ever said to the United Nations. But Trump said so much more. And all of it 100% pharmaceutical grade brilliance. Like this:</p>

<p>I have never loved a president as much as I love President Trump. Love him. Not ashamed to say it. I love my president.</p>
<p>Now, this.</p>
