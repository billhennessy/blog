<p>James Clapper lied to Chuck Todd.</p>
<p>Clapper wiretapped Paul Manafort and lied about it. <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/18/trump-was-right-obama-white-house-wiretapped-paul-manafort/">Just like Trump said</a>.</p>
<p>James Clapper looks like a kind old grandfather. Like Josef Stalin. Or an elderly Charles Manson.</p>
<p>Like Stalin and Manson, <strong>Clapper's soiled name deserves to be flushed into the bowels of history's bio hazard tank. </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mediaite.com/columnists/remember-when-james-clapper-categorically-denied-any-wiretap-against-trump-campaign/">James Clapper categorically denied that anyone associated with the Trump campaign was ever wiretapped.</a> He lied.</p>
<p>James Clapper swore he'd have known of any FISA court request for a wiretap of any Trump associate. And then <strong>he swore by inclusion that Paul Manafort was never wiretapped. </strong></p>
<p>Now we know Clapper is a liar. He lied to cover his criminal attempt to illegally steal the election.</p>
<p>Clapper is a liar. Flush the Clapper.</p>
