<h2>&nbsp;. . . And <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/19/flush-the-clapper-it-stinks/">It's Deep-State Handlers</a></h2>
<p>Jim Hoft is a genius.</p>
<p>From his St. Louis home, Jim runs one of the most influential websites in the universe, according to Harvard researchers. He's a legend. <strong>Like Andrew Breitbart, Jim Hoft reshaped the media</strong>. Hoft exposes the rotten bastards who call themselves "journalists."</p>
<ul>
<li>Caustic Jim Acosta</li>
<li>F*** Chuck Todd</li>
<li>Jake "The Fake" Tapper</li>
<li>Juannabe Williams</li>
</ul>
<p>Jim Hoft exposed these knuckle-dragging liars. These scavenger fish who cheer on Antifa's terrorism. These <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/want-another-scalise-style-shooting-jim-acosta-announces-kellyanne-conway-no-longer-secret-service/">thug-worshippers who hope for Kellyanne Conway's assassination</a>.</p>
