<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/27/nfl-losing-a-laugher-video/">I predicted the NFL would suffer a season-shortening labor dispute</a> this season or next.</p>
<p>The reason: President Trump's pressure on owners to crack down on anthem haters will stir up a fight between NFL Players Association and the owners.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/trump-nfl-anthem-protests-nfl-owners-afraid-players-video/">As if on cue</a>:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_24766" align="alignnone" width="1285"]<img class="alignnone wp-image-24766" src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-28-at-8.15.49-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-09-28 at 8.15.49 AM.png" width="1285" height="710"/><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/28/trump-nfl-owners-afraid-to-take-action-against-kneeling-players.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a>[/caption]</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speakable">President Trump, in an exclusive interview with "Fox &amp; Friends," said that NFL owners are &ldquo;afraid&rdquo; to act against their players protesting the national anthem at games across the country.</p>
<p class="speakable">&ldquo;The NFL is in a box and they have to do something about it,&rdquo; Trump told Fox News' Pete Hegseth, in the interview aired Thursday morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump essentially questioned the owners' manhood. The owners are wealthy business people. Huge egos. Extremely competitive. They will not resist Trump's challenge.</p>
<p>Watch for two things before Sunday:</p>
<ol>
<li>Several owners will break with their teams and the league by threatening to fine or fire any player who refuses to stand for the national anthem.</li>
<li>The NFLPA will issue a statement threatening to strike if any player is fined or fired for disrespecting the flag.</li>
</ol>
<p>Healing won't begin until <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/25/president-trump-popped-the-nfls-biggest-zit/">all the pus is out of the zit</a>.</p>
