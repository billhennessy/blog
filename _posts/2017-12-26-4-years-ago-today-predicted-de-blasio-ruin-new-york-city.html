    Where have you been?  I've missed you.

    I'm going to take a WAG at the questions.
    1. Worse
    2.  No
    3.  Much less than 54 million
    4.  More
    5.  No

<p>I'm scheduling this blog on December 26, 2013. I'm predicting Bill de Blasio will be as bad for New York City as Mayor John Lindsay (1967-1974).</p>
<p><a href="http://wp.me/p3daxv-3GK">Read the original blog here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's look back at the New York City de Blasio inherited. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-01/bill-de-blasio-inaugurated-109th-mayor-new-york-city-live-webcast">According to ZeroHedge blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;New York crime rates are at historic lows, the $72.7 billion budget is balanced, jobs are at an all-time high and a record 54 million tourists pumped money into the economy this year. Homicides have declined by almost 50 percent since Bloomberg became mayor in 2002, and this year&rsquo;s total of 333 through Dec. 29 is 20 percent below last year&rsquo;s record low.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is crime in NYC better or worse than in 2013?</li>
<li>Is the budget still balanced?</li>
<li>How many tourists visited NYC compared to the 54 million in 2013?</li>
<li>Were there more or fewer homicides than the 333 in 2013?</li>
<li>Is NYC on the right track?</li>
</ol>
