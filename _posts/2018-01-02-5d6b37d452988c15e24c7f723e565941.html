<p>Hi Bill,<br />
I am a writer for the New York Times who is writing a story about Dana Loesch. She and I discussed her being a co-founder of the St. Louis Tea Party and I would like to interview you for the the piece I am writing. (I recently went to Texas to see her.) Please email me and let me know when you are available to speak. I am trying to get the story done this week. My email is holson@nytimes.com. Office line is 212-556-4631. Thank you for your time and I look forward to chatting with you.<br />
My best,<br />
Laura Holson<br />
