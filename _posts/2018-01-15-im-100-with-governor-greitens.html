  content: "Eric Greitens violated his oath of office.\nI knew when Eric Greitens
    was running for Missouri governor he was a Navy Seal. What I did not know was
    after he got elected he became a king. On July 17, 2017 he set up a PDMP in Missouri
    via an EO circumventing the Missouri legislature, because the Missouri legislature
    failed to set one up to thwart the supposed &ldquo;opioid epidemic.&rdquo; The
    costs as stated to just set it up is going to be $250,000 to $625,000.  And is
    it just a coincidence that Express Scripts is getting the contract when they had
    contributed to Greitens&rsquo; campaign?\n\nGreitens has fallen into the trap
    of We have to do something! We have to do something! There is an OPIOIDE epidemic
    in the country. But wait, how can that be, when the other 49 states have had a
    PDMP and have been spying on people for years. BTW Most of the deaths are from
    overdosing on HEROIN.  And heroin is coming from Mexico. So if you REALLY want
    to do SOMETHING, support President Trump and get the wall built. Add to that there
    are more deaths from hospital born infections than overdoses. So WHY not close
    the hospitals. After all if we can save just one life wouldn't it be worth it
    to close them down? No, because the greater percentage of people get a benefit
    from having a hospital open where they can get treated at; just like many people
    get a benefit from taking prescription pain medications.\n\nMissouri was the only
    state getting it right. These databases are a violation of the people&rsquo;s
    Fourth Amendment RIGHT to privacy. The Fourth Amendment states, &ldquo;The right
    of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
    unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall
    issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
    describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&rdquo;
    Also, whatever happened to Doctor Patient CONFIDENTIALITY?\n\nApparently, the
    impetus for Governor Greitens to violate his oath of office and institute a state
    wide PDMP was his cousin died of a heroin overdose. The following questions I
    would like to ask Governor Greitens: What doctor is prescribing heroin for treatment?
    What pharmacy is filling the prescription? Does the governor know there are treatment
    centers throughout the state to treat addiction? And what if anything did he do
    to get treatment for his cousin?\n\nWell, there are TREATMENT centers for those
    WILLING to get treatment. And there are already drug laws on the books that can
    be enforced. And another thing, how does Greitens square on the one hand he says
    the information will be used by law enforcement, but on the other hand he said
    the information would be kept confidential? \nIt seems that Governor Greitens
    has forgotten about the NSA spying on American citizens, the IRS intimidation
    of Constitutional Tea Party groups and Governor Jay Nixon using the DOR to target
    gun owners.  The Government is already spying on us. Let's not make it any easier
    for them to do and for the people to lose more rights."

    Greg,

    I researched the prescription database Governor Greitens established. I found his model provides complete consumer protection. Unlike other states, Missouri does not track patient data, only prescribed data. I concluded that the Greitens was better for privacy than the Missouri Senate plan. Please read my report. https://hennessysview.com/2017/08/07/how-greitens-protected-privacy-in-missouri/

<p>Nothing has shaken my support for Eric Greitens.</p>
<p>People ask me if I'm sorry I supported him. Are you kidding?</p>
<p>Governor Greitens signed Right to Work. Something I've supported since it first appeared in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Governor Greitens strengthened Missouri's strong Right to Life policies.</p>
<p>Governor Greitens is rebuilding Missouri jobs and wages.</p>
<p>Governor Greitens is doing exactly what we elected him to do for Missouri.</p>
<p>Is he perfect? Of course not. Neither am I. I have flaws in places most people don't have places.</p>
<p>I won't write about speculations. What is known and admitted is only enough to confirm that Governor Greitens is a mere mortal. Like me. But far more accomplished.</p>
<p>I proudly wear my Day One shirt when I do dead lifts. It's the greatest testimony I can give. Because dead lifts are what prepare us for action. And I supported Greitens for action.</p>
<p>He's giving us action. He's making Missouri great again.</p>
<p>I stand behind my Governor. And I'm proud to say it.</p>
