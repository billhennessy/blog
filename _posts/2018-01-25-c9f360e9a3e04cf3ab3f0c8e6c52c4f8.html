<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I landed on one of your pages and noticed a broken link. On this page - https://hennessysview.com/2005/02/26/bind-torture-kill/, you have a link to AMW.com. You are likely already aware but the show got cancelled and it seems the website has now expired. You might want to remove that link or update to the Wikipedia page for posterity? Here it is - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Most_Wanted </p>
<p>Incidentally, if any of your visitors are interested in AMW then there is a good chance they will also be interested in the people and public records search information we have here - http://backgroundchecks.org/. </p>
<p>Perhaps when you are updating your site you could also include a link to our site as well? We&rsquo;ve organized the information and features by state to help people perform background checks and public record searches. </p>
<p>I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Joseph<br />
