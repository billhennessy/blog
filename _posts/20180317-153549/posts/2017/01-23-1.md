# Sean Spicer and the White House Press Corp Proved Me 100% Right

It's great to be right.

Yesterday I told you that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer played the White House press corps by telling the truth. But the press corps and many Americans have a psychosis that literally replaces some words with other words. It's not dyslexia. It's far worse because it's selective.

In this case, Spicer said "witness" but journalists everywhere repeated, "attend." I [wrote about it here](http://hennessysview.com/2017/01/23/how-to-spot-journalisms-psychosis/).

Well, today, Spicer explained the situation to a psychotic journalist almost the same way I did. Listen closely to this exchange:

Any reasonable person now realizes that journalists are psychotic. Even though they wrote down that Spicer said "witness," their minds operated as if he'd said, "attend."

I am right.
