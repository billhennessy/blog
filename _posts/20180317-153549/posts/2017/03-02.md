# How to Tell a Lie

You had to laugh. Claire McCaskill jumped on Twitter to announce she'd never met the Russian ambassador to the US. Before that, she jumped on Twitter to brag about being so damned important and vital that the Russian ambassador sought her oracle-like guidance.

After people mocked and scorned her silly lie, Claire McCaskill made up more lies to cover the first lie. You know, like a liar.

Senator McCaskill believes Jeff Sessions should resign for not telling a lie. Which is consistent in a perverted McCaskil sort of way.

**I call on Senator McCaskill to resign**. I also call on Jack Dorsey to shadow ban @clairecmc.

Thanks for your help. I smell an open Dem Senate seat.

Oh, I almost forgot.

If you're going to lie on Twitter, delete the tweets that expose your lie BEFORE tweeting the lie. It's just good lying.
