In 1966, Hollywood liberals made a very funny movie. The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! The movie mocked Cold Warriors and ridiculed hyper-paranoia about the dangers posed by Russia.

Some of those same Hollywood liberals are now running around screaming "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!"

Funny.
