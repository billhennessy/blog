# Gullible Evil Losers at CNN Criticize London Cops for Using Too Many Bullets. UPDATE

Maybe we should consider CNN employees enemy combatants.

CNN's latest hate-crime: **CNN is criticizing London police for using too many bullets. **

That's right. CNN will soon demand a UN war crimes tribunal to try, convict, and hang the London cops who put down the London Bridge terrorists.

**CNN has not responded to my request for comments**.

Specifically, I asked CNN to provide the exact number of rounds police are allowed to use to stop a terrorist.

While we wait for Jeff Zucker's precise bullet limit, I'll supply my own:**police should stop shooting terrorists when their last magazine is empty. **

UPDATE: CNN has removed this ridiculous story from the top of their home page.
