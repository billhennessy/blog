    The Tea Party actually started in 2007.  I was part of it and then got kicked out by the fake one that started AFTER Obama got elected.
    The GOP/party kicked out people that have been IN the fight for a lot longer than the last 4 years.
    Try 20 plus years for many of us.

<p>I want to solve real problems for real people through conservative solutions that dignify every American with the blessings of work and the opportunity to pursue happiness.</p>
<p>That, to me, is the ultimate in social justice. And I am for it.</p>

<h3>About Hennessy's View</h3>
<p>My blog is about owning your own life. (h/t Lee Presser)</p>
<p>I help connect and inform people who will work to solve problems by&nbsp;making people freer and stronger.</p>
<p>My 2016&nbsp;project is to break the unholy alliance between huge incumbent corporations (including banks) and the government cronies who protect their incumbency. I hope to achieve this by focusing on the <a href="http://hennessysview.com/2016/01/20/2016-is-the-year-we-overwhelm-the-flak-catchers/">Flak Catchers</a>.</p>
<p>I am proud that this blog has:<br />
* Proposed the St. Louis Tea Party<br />
* Kicked off a BUYCott to help Ferguson business after the riots<br />
* Helped push legislation (SB-5) in Missouri General Assembly to curtail municipal court and police abuses</p>
<p>I just want better lives through better, less intrusive government.</p>
<div></div>
<div>About Me (Third Person)</div>
<p>Bill Hennessy lives a varied life. (Maybe it&rsquo;s his attention span.) He grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. He left a theatre scholarship in 1984 to join the U.S. Navy where he spent nine years on active duty in the submarine force. He&rsquo;s been an activist, a <strong>writer</strong>, a small business owner, a <strong>software architect</strong>, and a <strong>new media marketing director</strong>. But his activism and writing are what most people want to know about.</p>
<p><strong>Activist </strong></p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s activism started in 1982. He recruited a group of his fellow Fontbonne students to hold a counter protest to a school-sponsored benefit for the SANE/Freeze campaign. Because of free beer at Bill&rsquo;s event, he outdrew the official demonstration.</p>
<p>That same year, Bill worked on Senator John Danforth&rsquo;s re-election campaign. Bill and a few other students would attend candidate debates and question the opponent, Harriet Woods, or her representative. Mercilessly.</p>
<p>On February 20, 2009, Bill&rsquo;s activism became a permanent fixture in his life. He and a St. Louis radio host, Dana Loesch, announced their Tea Party on the steps of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Hoping for 100 people, Bill and Dana saw over 1,000 people flood the sloping stairs to hear short speeches, sing <em>God Bless America</em>, and dump tea leaves into the Mississippi River. The St. Louis Tea Party was born.<a href="http://journeymapp.com/hennessysview/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2009.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-12001 alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://journeymapp.com/hennessysview/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2009-300x180.jpg" alt="2009.jpg" width="300" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>Since then, <strong>Bill has organized dozens of events and promoted hundreds. St. Louis has been at the epicenter of the tea party movement</strong>. It was here that SEIU employees beat Kenneth Gladney in August 2009. It was here that tea partyers dressed as SEIU members to protest Barack Obama&rsquo;s March visit. It was here that Congressman Russ Carnahan got caught making false accusations about a coffin.</p>
<p>Through the tea party and his writing, Bill has come to know Andrew Breitbart, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, Ambassador Tom Schweich, Roger Stone, and other national political celebrities. He has appeared on Neil Cavuto on Fox Business, Glenn Beck on Fox News, Larry Kudlow on CNBC, and numerous radio and local television programs.</p>
<p><strong>Writer </strong></p>
<p>Bill has written four&nbsp;books:</p>
<p><em><a href="http://journeymapp.com/hennessysview/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BillHennessy.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-13056 alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://journeymapp.com/hennessysview/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BillHennessy.png" alt="BillHennessy" width="337" height="449" /></a><strong>The Conservative Manifesto </strong></em><strong>(1993)</strong> which sold about 15,000 copies in 1993 and 1994, and was a Conservative Book Club Featured Alternate Selction twice.<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Conservatism-Reclaim-liberty-without/dp/1449959040?&amp;camp=212361&amp;linkCode=wey&amp;tag=hennesssview-20&amp;creative=391817" target="_blank"> <em>Zen Conservatism </em>(2009)</a></strong> asks readers&mdash;particularly conservatives&mdash;to take a breath and focus on the goal of liberty and limited government. The book offers tools and questions to help readers achieve their political goals by eliminating unnecessary distractions and unhelpful emotions. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weaving-Roots-Maximize-Social-Impact-ebook/dp/B004YW4LMI?ie=UTF8&amp;creativeASIN=B004YW4LMI&amp;linkCode=w01&amp;linkId=665bfdd3c539d01cbf8300ae596ade73&amp;ref_=as_sl_pc_as_ss_li_til&amp;tag=hennesssview-20">Weaving the Roots</a> (HarperCollins) helps grassroots activists get the most from social media. And <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Evolve-Governments-Secret-War-ebook/dp/B01DORSX0O?ie=UTF8&amp;creativeASIN=B01DORSX0O&amp;linkCode=w01&amp;linkId=5d1b42e7a044fc3a4e9f9f9fc901dc04&amp;ref_=as_sl_pc_as_ss_li_til&amp;tag=hennesssview-20">Fight to Evolve</a> (Coalition for Safer Drinking) exposes the government's TTB's suppression of NTX, a technology that eliminates most of the physical harm from drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>Bill is currently working on a book about his thought evolution on Donald Trump during the 2015-2016 campaign season.</p>
<p>Bill privately published a book of letters to his wife (then fianc&eacute;e), Angela, entitled <em>All My Love Forever </em>which he plans to turn into a novel next year.</p>
<p>Bill wrote a column, &ldquo;The Hennessy Report,&rdquo; for Town Hall on CompuServe from 1993 to 1996. In 1999, he began the blog &ldquo;Hennessy&rsquo;s View,&rdquo; from which he launched the St. Louis Tea Party in 2009. He currently edits stlouisteaparty.com. Bill is developing a business and happiness blog at billhennessy.net.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker </strong></p>
<p>Bill Hennessy is in demand as a speaker. In addition to speeches at major St. Louis Tea Party events, Bill has spoken to the Dallas Tea Party, American Majority&rsquo;s Post-Party Summit in Kansas City, the Alton Tea Party, the Quincy Illinois Patriots on the Prairie Rally, the Jefferson County Tea Party, and dozens of small group gatherings.</p>
<p>Bill is refining his <em>Zen Conservativsm </em>workshop, which helps people apply the lessons of the book to their daily lives and to their organizations. Bill loves writing, but he loves being with people, too.</p>
<p><strong>Personal</strong></p>
<p>Bill lives with his wife, Angela, and their children near St. Louis, Missouri. Bill is a Loyalty Marketing Strategist and Client Services Director&nbsp;for a St. Louis motivation and loyalty provider. He has served&nbsp;on the&nbsp;numerous board for non-profit civic and education organizations.</p>
